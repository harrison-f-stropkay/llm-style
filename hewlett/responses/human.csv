0,"Well, in my opinion I feel that computers have a negative effect on our society. I feel this way for many reasons; @CAPS1 three important reasons would be the following. First, most kids spend more time on computers then they do on homework which messes up their focus in school. Next, computers stop children from going to play outside and getting excercise which effects their health. Last but not least, I feel that computers stop kids from enjoying their family and friends and people around them who care. The first issue i will be discussing will be how computers take the time away from children who should be doing homework or reading a book. Children all over come home from school and the first thing they do is hop on the computer and usually spend hours doing nothing. By them doing that they do not complete their homework which effects their knowledge in school. If children did not have computers it would be easier for them to pick up a book and focus on their school work. My next reason that i will be adressing is how computers stop kids from getting the proper exercise daily and it stops them from getting fresh air and thats bad for their health. Before everyone in the economy had enough money for computers and laptops students would come home and play outside and get involved in sports but now all kids want to do is go on the computer and go on game websites and facebook which is horrible for their health without computers kids can stay in shape and live a healthy life. The last issue that i will be informing you about is how computers stop kids from spending time with their family and friends and spending more time on the computer. Children go to school everyday and most parents work when everyone finally gets home all kids want to do is go on the computers and even parents to. If children are always on the computer then it takes away from the time they can be spending with their loved ones. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that spend time with their family tend to do better in school and in life. With computers the percentage will go down. As you can see computers take away from all the good things in life. If there were not computers students can focus more on their work, they can get more exercise. and they can spend more time with the people they love. I hope i haved persuaded you that there is more to life then technology."
0,"Dear, Local Newspaper @CAPS1 here to inform you that the time we spend on computers is needed because it helps you with information, it helps you to become smarter and it helps you with hand-eye coordination. I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason. My first reason I'll like to state that will convince you with the time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about place's, people, culture and more it teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn so the time we spend on computeres is needed to learn new information. My second reason I'll like to state that will convince you with. The time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us to become smarter. Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it. Computers make you become become smarter. And at the end of the day it's about who's smarter not who does more excerise. My third and final reason which contribute to why we spend the time we spend on computer are needed because it teaches you good hand-eye coordination because it help with typing and become more faster to do essay's and when you have good hand-eye coordination you dont make a lot of mistake's typing. So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information, you become smarter, and it teaches good hand-eye coordination this is why a lot of computer time is needed probably even more computer time is needed. A lot of computer time is needed because you get smarter plus it beneifts society."
0,"The effects computers have on people vary from person to person but overall they have the general same effect. The things that is a most common effects is it teaches Hand-eye coordination. Advantages of computers are you can learn about places and/or people, and you can talk with people. Hand-eye coordination is an effect from computers. One advantage is that people can type faster. On average @PERCENT1 of people said that they have been able to type faster. This is a result of getting a feel of where the keys are and being able to look at the screen and type. Hand-eye coordination also helps with people being able to multi task. An example of multi tasking with hand-eye coordination is being able to talk to somebody and type-up something at the same time. An arguement is that computers take away from sports and exercise. But my friends said, ""I'm a goalie for my soccer team and having hand-eye coordination has really improved my skill. I can stop more soccer balls than I did before"". Therefor, it realy doesn't take away from sports because in most sports you use your hands. Another advantage about computers is that you can talk with people. Talking online is an advantage for some people who might not have a phone. Also talking online for maybe an hour or more is better than talking on a phone for that long. For adults who had lost tosch with old friends from growing up, can connect with them. This lets them catch up and re-connect with each other. Most people think that kids use computers for useless things. Kids don't really, in a survey @PERCENT2 of people under the age of @NUM1 said that what they do on the computer they find it to be productive. Most of the things are for the school. On the computer you can learn about places and/or people. When people look in a book about the place they want to learn about, more than likely it won't be as updated as a website would be. Also when they are looking for a place the website might tell them how they could be able to visit that place. Computers are a good thing because it teaches hand-eye coordination, you can talk with people, and you can learn about places and/or people. "
0,"Dear @CAPS1, I agreed with the people that feel that people should spend more time with the family instead of being stuck on the computer or laptop. I know that computer could be fun to chat or play game but also need to spend more time with your family for example go camping and parks, swim, fish, and go on vacation. Also want to spen as much time as posible just in case something gose wrong you will always remember the good times you had together. You also could help your grandparint build a gardin or play games. Instead of being a computer or a laptop you could big food chlose for you or your children you can even go to a restaurant. You can do al sorse of thing instead of beang on the computer. You can even go to a zoo to learn about all of animal. Like I sed I dont wayst your time on a computer on somewere and enjoy your life."
0,"Dear newspaper, Some people say that computers don't benefit society. But I think diferent. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and makes work much easier. They help prevent acidents, and the save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact. You can type you can plan your sedual. You can make a presantation or check your email. All of those things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Makeing work easyer or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computers abilitys. Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves. For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves. And that is all done with computers. Also planes, the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore @CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for every one. Finaly computers save lives, its completly true. In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs and asist with surgery. In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives. Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection. As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easyer. They prevent acidents with which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go they are almost garenteed a survival. So what do you think about them now."
0,"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! ""Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?"" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!"
0,"There are many great things about computers. If we were to loose them then our lives would change dramatily. You can use computers for exercise then it is also up to the @CAPS3 on limits. Last it can save lives Computers are great, if we were to loose them. There would be no more internet. you would't be able to talk to friends on @CAPS1 or e-mail. Cell phone prices would go through the roof. We would technacly be going back @NUM1 to @NUM2 years. Last with out computers there would be more diffeculty in large companies Computers can help exercise. One way is we can find closest gyms on the internet. We can find what is healthy to eat right away You can also get one of those @CAPS2 fits for a computer. Also you can find free work out videos. Next, it should be up to the @CAPS3. It is their discretion if they see that the child is spending to much time on the comuter and gaining weight they can easaly limit it. they can say for very hour your on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise. Lastly the computer can save lives. Before computers medicine like tylonal was used for everything. Stuffy nose, headache, cold etc. Now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous. You can also find the nearest hospital. Finally, computers can do a lot of good, even though it can make less unhealthy if you spend to much time on it it can save your life. It can also destroy companies and our lives, @CAPS3 can give limits and computers can used to exercise. So reading this essay please don't take away our computer"
0,"Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordinaiton? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type. Without having to lock down at the keyboard. Even if people don't have the program they can learn how to type fact without having to look down. Many people that I know, have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them hour to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet you can go and searching person or place and the computer will find it for you. Children and adults need computers because if for example, a child get a project from schoool that need to be done about a famous person or smoking. she would most likely need to go to the internet . The game goes for adults that love jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computer can be used to comunicate with each other. People use computer to communicate with friends or family in far away places. They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand-eye coordination, and help you move your fingers faster. They give poeple and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e-mail, message and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person."
0,"Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial. Thank you for your time."
0,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing a letter to you today because I have herd a complaint that and more people are using computers and getting less exsercise. These experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends more. These experts @MONTH1 be smart but they are wrong. I am going to tell you how they are wrong. My first example is that people that go on the computer alot still exercise. Take twitter as a example. The football player ocho-cinco ""tweets"" all the time but that doesn't mean he doesn't get exercise. There are plenty of sports players that are on twitter and they are fit. Most of the kids in my grade including me have a facebook. Most of the kids are fit. Just because they are on the computer alot doesn't mean they can't exercise. My second example is the effect of the computer. Students use the computer for a lot of things. We use wikipedia for are projects and research a person. Some schools know a day almost depend on computers. I rember when I lived in country we never had to reely type anything unless it was a project. When I moved to @CAPS3 I am always typing something. Even a rough draft they want me to type. In couentry I would write out my final draft. I have to use the computer. Schools also are teaching us about the computer @CAPS4 as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more. When someone. Finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and @CAPS4 on. My third example is how the experts say that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends. My grandpa, aunt, other family members have a facebook account. That means I can still interact with family and friends. The people that are the computer alot that are adults probably don't have family over every night and probably go out with friends evey once in a while. Computers also benefit Society for buisness people they might have to a powerpoint and they have a computer. When experts say we need to enjoy nature, interact with family and friends, and do more excising they might be right but we can do all these things but we can also still go on the computers. If you take a survey in @CAPS3 to see how many people are on the computer almost everyday and then you ask them how many of them exercise you would see that you can do both."
0,"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are machines that have been around for @MONTH1 years. With internet, you can do things like play games, research information, and even talk to friends and family, all through a computer. Advances in computer technology are beneficial to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These includes that computers improve hand-eye coordination, provide abundant information, and allow people to talk online. As said earlier, using a computer can improve hand-eye coordination. In fact, it is known that computers can immensely improve your reflexes. This reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing. Patrick, my brother, was then literally assigned by the doctor to play computer games to help his hand-eye coordination. As a matter of fact, @PERCENT1 agree that computers can have a gargantuah, positive impact on reflexes and hand-eye coordination. If computers heldful in this way and, in some cases, necessary for your eyes, then why would the use of computers be classified as bad when they are clearly a beneficial factor in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because of what huge resource they are. the internet offers so much information for people of all ages who want to learn and thrive. For example, most schools have their students use computers for research. When I say most schoold, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to research using a computer. Principal of new city @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS1 students use computers at leat every week if not more. They are fantastic resource with endless information."" Computers are getway to countless amounts of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away. I, myself, have friend who lives in @LOCATION1 that I miss very much. When long-distance phone calls are too expensive most of the world and I rely on computers to talk to out far-away friends. Computers are the bridge between @CAPS2; (my @CAPS3 friend) and I. However, computers are not only used long distance. I also use computers to e-mail, instant message, video chat, and just stay connected to family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, says. ""I use my computer to stay connected with friends and my family that lives in another county. I don't know what I would do without it."" This means that @PERSON1 and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and Family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They help people, educate, and connect people. You must have access to a computer in my opinion, in order to thrive in life."
0,"I belive that computer technology is a positive effect on people. I think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and talk to people online. Here are some reasons why. My first reason is because the computer can teach you how to type faster. For example, for the use of your fast writting you can get a good job/career and can have a future in your life. Another example, is because you can type e-mails faster and don't need to type slow. Last example, is that you can improve you typeing skills and become a better typer. My second reason is because you can learn about far away places. For example, you can learn about other countries and how it's different from our country and how their alike. Another example, is you can use it for projects, get all your information and be prepare for a great project. Last example, is you can always learn something everyday from your computer, like news, weather etc. My third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people. For example, you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how their doing. Another example, is when your bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it. Last example, is you can talk to your friends and plan when to hang out and go outside and get fresh air, That way you don't have to be in your house all day. That's why I think that computer technology is a good idea because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and allows you to talk to people online. I hope you agree with me also, and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, Local newspaper do you think that the computer is a good technology in our generation today? Well I do not believe it is a good technology in our generation. Do not get me wrong. I do not like to go on the computer bat their are so many reasons why computers affect alot of children and some adults in this generation. Like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise. That is why kids these days are so over wheight there are more than @NUM1 million children over wheight because of the computer . Like for me I use to love goin on the computer and I still do bat I see that the computer is dostroying my heatlh. A second reason why I believe is bad for the generation because there are alot of inapropreate sites on the internet, where kids that are @NUM2 and younger could be logging on to. I think that people all over the world should start enjoying nature, go travle the world. Start doing things that people cant do on the computer. I think that more kids should start interesting with family and friend more often. of talking to your friend all the time. My last and finally reason that is a big thing is going on in the computer is people bullying other people the internet, local newspaper have would you if you have any daughters, sons, grand and. If they was getting bullyed over that internet or concern them to kill them or hurty them. I think you would horribly and you would want that person to go to jail. For now on I am going to think when I spend all mu time on the computer how it affect my life and my family, friends. I belive other people in the world should do the same thing."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people. It all depends on how you look at it and what type of person you are. You can say computers have a very positive effect on people or say computers have a very negative effect on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people but you can't say that I am just a kid and she plays on it all the time. Well that is true however, it can teach you hand-eye coordination. For @CAPS2 what I am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster. Another @CAPS2 is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type. Me personally am faster at than writing. My final reason is after a hard day at school or work you can come home, play some music and relax. It is a good idea to learn how to type fast so if you are let's say writing a story for school. You just started the story and it is due tomorrow. What are you going to do well if you stared to type when you were younger by the time you are in the middle school you could type really fast. That way you could finish your story in time. This means you should learn haw to type faster. Some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write. I personally prefer to type than write but that is just me. Let's say a friend of mine like to write more than type that is ok. We will not be not friends after that we will just like the same thing that is all. This means some people prefer to write than type. This probably happens after a hard day at school or work you can come home use the computer to play some music and relax. You can play all the music you want. As well as do other things as well as the same time. For @CAPS2, I play music and talk to my friends at the same time. I @CAPS3 use it to do homework. In conclusion, it is a good idea to keep computers to use. People can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time. Over all computers have a positive effect on people."
0,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are several reason how computers have effect on people. My position is to convice the local newspaper why certain people @CAPS2't and @CAPS3 use computers. People getting caught up on the @CAPS4, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the @CAPS4. In effect, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stay on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that his on a @CAPS5 line, hooking up with other people. He for gets about everybody. He's so on the @CAPS4. He stop going school, he gaining. Now he just a nobody. He just sit in front of his computer and do nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid @CAPS5 line. @CAPS8's not hard to find another in our city. @CAPS8's alot of beautiful young lady's out here to explore. Similary, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important, and start paying attention on other things like the, was a great person. She was so successful. She make tons of money. Until she start losing her her job. She stop cause she was so stock on facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend @CAPS6 you could meet other people from different @CAPS7 you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turn her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now. How she got fired, how she don't pay her bill, and how she moving into a. Sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life. Consequently, certain people @CAPS3 use computer because the @CAPS4 help you with certain things. In summation, @CAPS8 help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the @CAPS4. One time I sign up for this website that was called myspace. For moment I did got caught up on @CAPS8. Continue line."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, more and more people are getting hooked on computers. I am here to say that computers are not the best way to benefit our society. First off, most @CAPS1 are spending less time with friends/family and more time looking through a screen. Also, it would be so much better for our bodies and minds to go out and enjoy nature instead. Lastly, you can get addicted to the computer. So here are my reasons why computers do not benifit our society. My first reason includes friends and family. more and more people are neglecting to spend time with their loved ones to get to the next level on '@CAPS2 wars.' @CAPS3 this really how we want our future generations growing up, looking blankly at computer screens? I know I don't want that. I lknow this from personal experience. When I was young, I visited my cousin @PERSON1. All I would get to see of him was a quick '@CAPS4', but then held escape to his room to continue clicking angry on the computer. The point @CAPS3 you can't replace family and friends with a computer screen. It's not right. My next argument against computers @CAPS3 about our bodies and minds. The best way to take care of those things @CAPS3 nature. Unfortunately most @CAPS1 aren't getting outside for a wack of exercise due to computers. In fact almost @NUM1 @CAPS1 say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else. This @CAPS3 not a good way to spend time. We need to solve this issue before more @CAPS1 make the switch from nature to computers. Fresh air, trees and birds are much better than a screen, a couple clicks, and the hum of a machine. My third and final reason @CAPS3 about addiction. So many people are getting adicted to the things they are finding on their computers. Addiction @CAPS3 a very sericuse matter that we need to fix. All of this @CAPS3 pointing to lazyness too from lack of intrest to anything else. I know this from personal experience. When my brother first got his computer he literally locked himself in his room for days. All he did for almost a week was socialize and beat his personal best score on a game. This @CAPS3 not the way to be treating a device. So, as I know you can all see computers don't have a positive impact on our society. First of all computer @CAPS3 over ruling family and friends. Also, nature @CAPS3 becoming less and less of a priority with the computer in mind. Lastly it's becoming a worldwide addiction. Thank you for deeply considering all the arguments that I have to offer. I know it majorly helps people keep in touch globaly, but there are other ways to do it, such as mail."
0,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly belive that computers don't benefit society as much as people think. I think that nature can provide all of the same qualatys than any computer can. A computure can not provide fitness, real interactions with friends of family, or experience in the real world. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION2 are overweight because of a lack of exercising? Acording to @CAPS1 @PERSON1. a @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise. So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to sociaty? Anotherthing on that topic is that overweight children that spend @NUM1 hours. Put off healthy activatys such as basketball or tennis wich also leaves them socialy behind and lacking he healthy experiences wich leads me to my next point. People think that computers know everything, but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer. For example you @MONTH1 read about world war @CAPS2 but you realy know what people were thinking or what the combat fealt like? A computer can not teach you how to feal only a real life experience can do so. Many if you were deployed to an army write in @LOCATION1. You would know what its like to be in war. but playing a game or reading an article don't provide experience. My @NUM2 explamation for how computers are not the greatest affect on scociaty is true life interactions with your family and friends. Their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally. People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the @CAPS3 all the time but the only why to be satisfied is by seeing them for real for example a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was threw the @CAPS3. Unlike most relationships that sucseed. I hope my letter to your newspaper will get peoples attention, I would apretiate it if you joined my cause and help protect scociaty from dangerous computure technology that could cause, obesity, bad relations, and inexperience."
0,"I believe that the effects computers have on people is bad. One reason is that if you spend too much time on a computer you could have a bad posture from leaning over. Next, the computer keeps people from going outside and getting exercise. Lastly, the computer keeps people from doing things they need to do. You could have a bad posture from leaning over too much. When you are on a computer you want to be as close to it as you can, so you would hunch over to get a better view. When you are typing you would lean to see what you are writing. If you are on the computer hunched over too much it would become a habbit to always lean over, especialy when you walk. The computer can keep people from getting exercise and going outside. most children would go on the computer when they get home, instead of going outside to play. The computer has so many things to do or it wich temps children to go on all the time. It is one of the main causes that a large percentage of kids are overweight in the @LOCATION1. The computer keeps people from doing necessary things they need to do. A lot of kids will not do their homework because of the exercise time spent on the computer. People procrastinate either communicating with friends, playing a game or even shopping online wich is a major factor from doing important things. If there was no computer people would not be as tempted, therfore they would get on with their life and complete things that have to get done. The computer has a bad and unecessary effect on people. it gives people a bad posture keeps them from getting exercise and going outside. It also keeps people from doing things they to do. The computer is one of the main forters in children and also adults being overweight. Therfore the computer has bad impacts on people in society."
0,"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it. On the hand, I believe the computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: @CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over @MONEY1 but on a computor you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5"" they can be games about sports. Supose one student broke his leg and he love playing soccer. He could just on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can @CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computors are made for is to learn new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if every one put what they know into the computer than people can get learne any thing from them, I remember @CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me, @CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If he ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it he/she always tells us to either ""@CAPS7"" it or ""@CAPS8"" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers you can @CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be me right now? Anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it @CAPS9 or @CAPS10, or whether its @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11 all are a great way to communicate with people. With tele phones it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the roputer it is absolutely freen. You could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5. You could live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. Communication every where is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. @CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our fare throught the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negitive at all for all I know is that help people around the @CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. @CAPS1, it teaches children and adults various now things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowlege. But, many people do not think about the negative affects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make comunication easy, but there are many negative affects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside excersising and communicating with friends and family. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know whats going on outside of the office. There, are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computers functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as microsoft powerpoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Typing can help majority with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great pendmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computer, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer, instead of ouside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abrevations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""i dont know"". This language is damaging how kids read and write. Although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can do also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. this is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened. As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe, if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their childs safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drasticly over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable."
0,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my @NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree that spend more time on a computer than work outor do other things like cleaning his/her home or room. Anther reson is if you are on a computer talk to someone you mite not know who they are or how old they mite be be. @CAPS2 last reson why is more people needs to excercis then its on a computer all day @CAPS2 first reson was he or she how to clean there room or house because if you stay on a computer you will never time to clean you meat someone online and if they come over they mite not want to stay with you because your to clean and @CAPS2 last reson is if you dont have a clean house you can find games or for the computer. @CAPS2 reson was you mite know what are they are who they are because if you ask these because you are talking to online to come over they mite be a killer or a rapist. Plus if you talk to that person everyday you or they mite be come with each other. If you mite be driven crazy for that person and crazy stuff. @CAPS2 last reson for this message is to excercis because if you are on a computer all day you will never have to exercis. Or if you yoo can't be active like playing baseball. So when you do get off ther computer and go play baseball you will be slow or not even want to play at all. Iam in conclusion computers are good to have but not the last thing to do all day because you will not be able to clean your house, you mite talk to all killer or not be to work out and be fit @CAPS3 you for reading."
0,"Dear looal newspaper, People and student need computers, because they teach students to do h/w also give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Fanlly allow people and student to talk online with there friends and family. Computers is a important tool so I belive that we should have them. In my poni of viwe, computers is a good tool. They teach and help student to do there homework. For example when students writing a prompt they can tipe it on the compurter and even chack it. But not only it have tipeing and spell chack but it also can give people and student the abitity to learn about faraway places and people. Aother benefits, why student and peolp can have computer is because they give people and student the abitty to learn abot farway places and people. For example if student have to give a speech to there class about a importan person. They can go online and look that person up not only you can do reach but you can talk to friends and family online. Fanlly people and student can even allow to talk online with friends and family."
0,"Dear news paper, Computers were made for doing research not video games. Now the world is abusing computers like no tomorrow. Instead of using computers to go on facebook or myspace we should be going to the gym, going outside and spending time with your family. Going to the gym is a great way to work out and to be healthy. When your on a computer the only thing your working out are your fingers. There are many things you can do at a gym like, run, pump some iron (lift weights), play a sport ( @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or somthing else), and enjoy being healthy. Running for a good mile will burn lots of caleries, so does pumping iron and playing sports. Pumping iron will make your muscles bigger, unlike a computer geek. Now let's think, would a girl like to go out with a big strong guy with lots of muscle or a computer geek with strong finger muscles? Palying sports will burn coleries too. Instead of playing a basket ball game on the computer why don't you play a real game and make the winng shot. Wjile you are doing these things you can think to yourself that your a healthy dude and you enjoy being in shape. While computer geeks are inside tweeting and stuff you could go skiing have a snowball fight, make a fire and all kinds of things. These activities are fun, most get your heart pumping and your enjoying fresh air while doing it. In the @DATE1 when the sun is shinning you could go to the beach with your nice taned body from the gym and do a little tanning. Your not going to get any number without having a nice tan. After getting a tan your serious I candy to any girl that walks by you. A computer needs are probably is really pail and most girls I know dont like pail guys. Do you think computer needs spend time with there family? Well probably not sience there working out there fingers. In my life family is most imortant. We do lots of things together like, watch movies, sports, games eat and lets of other things. Computer nerds don't have that special bond with there family. So newspaper readers, think about the life of a computer nerd and the life of a person who stays active, healthy, and isn't waisting his life away. Which one do you think is better?"
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways. Computers definitly help people keep in touch. There is @CAPS1, myspace, twitter, facebook, email, and even video chat. For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1 a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they're only going to get better. If computers are so great now, just imagine what they will be like in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. Plus, the more people buy and use computers the more company are going to want to invent new ones. As you can see computers are only going to get better. The last reason I would like to share with you today is that computers help kids tromendously. On average, about @PERCENT1 of kid in the @CAPS2.S use a computer every day. Kids use it to talk to friends, play games, do homework and to do many other things as well. Also, kids and adults just use computers if they need to know how to do something or even find places in their town. This is how kids are helped out by computers. As you can clearly see, computers are used all around the world for many different reasons. They help to stay in touch, they're only going to improve, and the help kids. Everyone is using computers, shouldn't you?"
0,"Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the internet (provided with most home desktop computers) can teach us a lot about the world around us. Additionally, the whole fact of contacting others around the globe, as well as having a whole fun world to explore, makes computers more enjoyable. Finally, thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers. Due to this, computers are , without a doubt, beneficial to society. The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly, beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like @CAPS1, subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much rather cheap, affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year. Because of this, computers are definately beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shoes, which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand of computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based in the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job. With this reason, why doesn't anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society? With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and makes workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life?"
0,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 and I think computers are a great thing. Three reasons why I think this are: you can learn, people can communicate, and they very fun to use. Hopefully by the time you finish reading, you will also think computers are great and have good effects. While visiting places is great, learning about places is even better. Anyone can surf the web and find tons of facts about anything. Say you wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but your budget was tight. Use the web. There are tons of videos, facts, pictures, and other things on @ORGANIZATION1 world. You still @MONTH1 not be able to ride rides or play games there, but at least you can get a good feeling about @ORGANIZATION1. Also, anyone can learn about other countries! Millions of facts on any country or state no matter where it is. You could even talk with people from around the world, which brings as to @CAPS2 next point. Communication is key. Especially in this day, it is very important to talk and socialize. There are many messaging systems that can be used to communicate. AIM, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION2 are just few of e-mail and instant messaging systems. It @MONTH1 take days to get mail to other countries via air-mail. But with e-mail, messages are sent in mere seconds. Also, video chatting is on the rise. If you can't visit someone, then talk through video. You can see and hear each other the entire time. Even though they are almost @NUM1 miles or more away, you can still meet them face-to-face. Boy, all this computer talk sure is fun. Seriously though, computers are very fun. You can go onto game sites or play solitare or even pinball. No more going out to the arcade and spending your parents pay checks. The games are free (depending which website) and, for the most part, fun. But wait, there's more! Are you older and don't like video games and other games? Then watch videos. Need on update on the news but it is long before @LOCATION2 news is on? Then go to a news website. YouTube is also great for videos. Funny, sad, or dramas are all part of the ""tube"" community. So have fun and keep your wallets full. Well, I have told you three reasons why computers are good and have great effects on people. If you still aren't buying it, then get this last reason: the price. As I talked about in previous segments, the cost is low. If you keep the computer well maintained, you can get great things out of it. Some computers can get very high in price, but the average is low. Around @MONEY1 to @MONEY2 on average. So you see, computers are great and have very good effects on people. If you don't believe me, then go out and try one yourself. I am sure you will love it."
0,"Computers are inventions that are good and bad. They help people, but after a while they are no good. Some kids like to read in their free time, opposing I.M. ing. Many teenagers prefer seeing their friends, instead of their typing. Also, almost any legal minor will agree that they'd like to actually play a sport than click buttons on a mouse. Computers @MONTH1 be taking over some people, but others are still fighting them. Some people like to read fiction, others don't. You can't read a book on the computer. You can read a chapter or two, so about @NUM1 pages, maximum. I don't know about you, but when I read a book I want to be able to hold a copy of it. ""I like to read a lot, so I don't use the computer much. If I do use the computer I use it for home work, or I go on @ORGANIZATION1 and look for books."" @CAPS2 @PERSON2, a middle school student. ""I don't spend all day reading, thoug, I like to hang out with friends too."" Everyone likes to see their friends. Actually most people prefer to see their friends than a computer screen. ""I text my friends, I also I.M. them, but I'd really rather see them in person,"" @CAPS2 @PERSON1. ""@CAPS1 does spend a lot of her time on the computer, but she also spends a lot of it with her friends."" @CAPS2 her twin, @CAPS3. Kids like to run around. It's something that they've been known for. A recent survey of the @NUM2 grade students shows that @PERCENT1 of them spend more time on the computer. This survey is very similar to one conducted before computers were popular and affordable. So even now, when most of the population spends all day on the computer, others do not. Kids spend time, reading, seeing their friend and playing sports rather than surfing the web."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you? @PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt @CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to @CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go @CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity."
0,"I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world. Store things on them, and use them for entertainment. Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world. This is good because instead of calling people you can go on computer and talk to them for free. Long distance phone calls cost a lot. But if you can just go on your computer and talk to them there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasnt a computer people would be talking to as much people and there social life would be bad making there life not as exciting. This is one reason why I think that computer have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers give a positive effect in people if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lieing around is in the way. Well if you have a computer there are featers that your able to store thing and because much more organized. Being more organized there is less stress one you start to feel better about lossing things and being able to find them. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play game, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you cant aford to get a game system them you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much what ever game or close to the game that you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have @CAPS1 and download musics to something or go to web sites that have musical on them. Also you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away. I hope that I convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people. Being able to play games, store thing, and chat with other people is pretty amazing."
0,"Guaranteed, @NUM1 years from now we will still be using computers they are probably talking to friends, doing research on something or are typing up something for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we can't do by ourselves. Without computers life as we know it would probably be way different. Firstly, computers let us talk to our friends and family. Allowing us to communicate to one another without us leaving the safety of our homes. See, just recently a girl in @CAPS1 went over her friends' home to do their homework together. When they were done the girl tried to walk home, and she was never seen again. With computers we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes. Clearly, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Secondly, computers let us do research about stuff we don't know about. Allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe not have the info. you're looking for if it was to search @ORGANIZATION1 it would give me a map pointing out it's location and the schools website where I can find out my homework for that night. As you can see the computer allows ud to do things that would take us far more longer to do regularly. Without a doubt, without computers life as we know it would probably be way different @CAPS2, Computers allow us to do homework on it wether it's research or just typing something up, it lets us do more capable things. Most of our daily homework is on the computer. Just @DATE1 we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. So far in @NUM2 grade almost every night our homework is on the @CAPS3 if we were to forget to write down our homework we would have another to get this information. Obviously, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Furthermore, computers are on advancement in technology that this uses constantly. Computers let us look up valuable info. on things around the world. They let us talk to friends and family around the world. They @CAPS3 help us achieve great things in @ORGANIZATION1, wether it be homework or classwork. Without them it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something without them. Finally, I believe that people who are against them just haven't used them in the correct manner."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people find the clicking and clacking of computers a nuscense. What they don't realize is thay are helping the youths lives and making them easier and they could be doing the same for them. This is why computers have a very good effect on people. First off computers arn't a bad thing if they are just helping people get to know each other better. You always see ad's for dating websites and other things like that. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online. Thats a lot and to think they would have never if it wern't for computers. Second of all computers provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 on computer games online. @CAPS2 of them are free too. I bet almost every kids has played a game on the internet before. Think about it your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer. You are probably thinking, computers sound so childish and infantile. Well computers arn't just fun and games. They provide a lot of information. They are very useful for teens in school for projects, but they benefit adults in many ways too. It provides information on vacations, hotels, ext. Also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to and other useful information. So as you can see computers arn't just a pain. They help bring people together, provide entertainment and have very useful information. Think about it. A computer might save your life one day. Computers help peoples every day lives and they could be helping yours."

If you are on the computer all of the time you could become a loner, and hurt the people you love by not spending enough time with them. On the other hand, while on the computer you can learn many new things. You can learn about faraway places, your local news, and world wide news. For example the earthquake that hit @LOCATION1. Furthermore, being on the computer too much can interfeer withe your health and wellness. Being on the computer too much will cause you to become lazy. You need fresh air every once in a while and @NUM4 out of @NUM5 doctors say too much computer time in one sitting can cause health problems. We surveyed @NUM6 people @PERCENT1 of the people go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a week. The other @PERCENT2 of people we surveyed went on the computer for @NUM8 hours a week and more. That is way too much computer time. The @PERCENT2 that for that much time are just putting themselves at risk and hurting the ones that they love."

0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I heard about the recent argument over time spent on computers, I knew I had to state my opinion, I am one of the people who spends a lot of time on computers and I have found it intriguing, educating and helpful. I use my computer for schoolwork, daily needs and for catching up with friend and family. CAn you imagine our lives without computers? A computer turnd an impossible homework assignmnet inot a ten minute task. If you don;t know the answer off the top of your head or can't find it in your notes, just google it and up comes thousands of reliable sorcues with your answer! I can't tell you how many @ORGANIZATION1 a computer has saved me from a sticky situation. Now a days, teachers have copies of textbooks online, so you can't use the olde, ""I forgot to bring my book home,"" excuse even if you're not doing homework, I've found theres ways to learn new things. As soon as I sign on to @ORGANIZATION2 mai, there are several educational stories that are ther for you to read. I couldn't imagine school without computer technology. Another way computers have helped me inlife is making friends. i could count at least is friends that I've made through facebook, aim and other social networks. I know parents complain that kids are on @NUM1, but there are plenty of people who know when enough is enough. If yuou want a friend to come over but they won't answer their phone, you could just I.m of write on their facebook wall. I have realized what a small world it is through facebook. I've found people who are related to me, know someone who I know, or went to pre-school and elementary school with. Computers are one of the best ways to socialize and make new friends. Could you picture what the world would be like with no computers? You couldn't look up directions, email, shop online or play vidoe games. Almost every weekened I google the adress to my hockey game so I know how to get there. What would I do without it? If you are sick, you would not be able to shop for neccesities online nad wouldn't be able to get them. Theer would be on video games, which I know teens like me love. The world has changes, and some people need to modernize. Life would be so much harder without computers, why not use the unstressful and simpler way?"
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say, ""@PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily"" The reccomened time limits is @NUM2 hour. By spending more time on computers people aren't exercising. Secondly, those people aren't enjoying life and nature. Lastly, the use of computer puts a strains on social skills between friends and family. Surely the effects of computers cant be good. First off, people in this aren't exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes effects <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4. Both of these diseases are lethal. If you spend so many hours on the computer these diseases wouldn't spread nearby as fast. When will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercuse so these won't affect you? Secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. Sure camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. But, there are many ways to experience nature without ""roughing it."" You can go to the or to the aquarium. Sit on your back pond and go bird watching. All of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. Yes you can email, I. M., @CAPS5, and @CAPS6 family and friends, but its not the as people are less and friendly then they. Mainly of socia skills. We need to the of social without computer. In conclusion, computer do have a negative affect on people in the long tern. People aren't exersising. They aren't enjoying nature. Finally their bonds between friends and family are weahiming. This is a growing problem which must be put to end. Thank you for your time."
0,Dear local newspaper I raed ur argument on the computers and I think they are a positive effect on people. The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a wed chat. The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world you could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work. When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat. The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers for exmple when you made this artical you didnt use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out if we didnt have computers it would make ur @CAPS1 a lot harder. Thank you for reading and whe you are thinking adout it agen pleas consiter my thrie resons.
0,"would you rather read six books to get that one recipie, or would you rather look it up in less than ten minutes? I think computers have an positive effect on people you can learn about places you want you need in minutes and you can talk to your friends inline Computers have a good effect on people because, you can learn about places you want to wish this @DATE1. For example, @PERSON5 wanted to wish @LOCATION2 this @DATE1 but when he looked online he saw how @LOCATION2 just had an earthquake so he changed his plans this @DATE1. @CAPS1, @PERSON2 said ""I wanted to go to @LOCATION3 this @DATE1 but I know about it, so I searched on google and figure thatb this @DATE1 I will go to @LOCATION3"" that is one positive thing computers effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit in the @DATE1. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can @CAPS1 find what you need in minutes. For example. @PERSON3 was looking for a cake recipie, he was looking many cook books but find it, so he took thru his labtop and found it in under five minutes, @CAPS1, computer experts @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 of rooming thru books and books for information you nead why not go to the and the truxt me its much"" @CAPS3, computers have a good effect on people because you can talk to your friends online, for example, @PERSON6 said ""I moved from @CAPS4 to @LOCATION1 and I was sad to leave my bestfriend but knod how I can talk to her on @CAPS5."" @CAPS1, @PERSON4 was in bed sick and coudnt go ourside to visit his friends so he kelf intouch with them on @CAPS7.

0,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I am a students in @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. I want to state a opinion on how computer effects people. There are many thing like games, chatrooms, socile thing. Also information for homework or for work and jobs. Well let get started @CAPS1 opinion on people using ocmputer is good, only fools don't use computers. They help you a lot like, let say I am a coole and I forgot how to do something, I'll just go on the computer and fine it and it that easy. I use a computer all @CAPS1 life and I am smart, I even help @CAPS1 mom use the comptuer sometimes. Chat room are good to you can make new friends and you can talk to family members, like your mom dad or causen if they live in a different part of the world. I talk to @CAPS1 cansen all the time not reuily a little and he live in colombia. I also talk to @CAPS1 friends on facebook to ask what was the homework sometimes. Games, games are fun when you get bored or do not have nothing to do. You can play all different kind of games like action or if you want a chenllens you can play hard games i think games like chess or sodotea. To help your brain thnk to exercise your brian. Games can help you knew the computer more like they bored, many people don't even knew how to type with out looking at the borad. I have to look at it. Well thus where same opinion I had about the computer. Even though people think it take time from exercising and interacting with people it not really time. There exercising there brian and they can interacte with people. So till next time"
0,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 some people @MONTH1 be concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer, many experts can argue that computers are a wonderful things. Did you know that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 own a computer? That is because computers help you gain skills that are used multiple times throughout your life. Also, with a computer, people can gain instant access to anything they need. One last reason is that many people use computers to keep in touch with friends or relatives, perhaps those who live far away. It @MONTH1 seem that a computer plays a big role in one's life, and truth is, they @CAPS6 continue helping people build foundations for future careers and goals. Many times, when you look for a job, you have to fill out a resume. A resume shows the business owner @CAPS5 skills you have and @CAPS5 skills you're willing to put forward to help the company. Nowadays, more and more companies have started using computers and knowing how to use one is a basic necessity. ""I'm on a computer every day at work filing claims, doing paperwork, and helping customers,"" says @PERSON1, an insurance under writer in @LOCATION1. If she did not have good typing skills, great hand-eye coordination, and excellent word processing skills, she wouldn't have been hired for the job. The young generation is getting an early start on building that foundation that they @CAPS6 use throughout their futures it @CAPS6 sure come in handy someday. Say you're a reporter for channel @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1. There's a breaking story that your audience needs to hear as soon as possible. You log onto your computer to find instant information on the story. Your twitter feed is exploding with the exciting @ORGANIZATION1 and now you have material to report on for your @ORGANIZATION1 report. The moral is, with a computer people gain instant access to @ORGANIZATION1, whereas, they might have to wait hours for the local @ORGANIZATION1 report, or in this case, they are the reporter looking for. Resident of @LOCATION3, @PERSON2 says ""The @CAPS3 homepage is one of my daily fixes. I check it multiple times a day!"" overall, that goes to show that people all over the world can be aware of the latest happenings on their planet. The last, and possibly most important reason for computers is to keep in touch with people. You can easily sign onto @CAPS4 and talk with your cousin who lives all the way in @LOCATION2. Or the friend that you miss who only lives an hour away. One knows that social networking is a daily stop, and it's an awesome way to keep in contact. @PERCENT2 of the people in the world have some type of instant messenger all their, a recent study showed you just have plans with your friend and can't remember @CAPS5 time to meet. A quick virtual message saying ""@CAPS5 time do you want to go?"" @CAPS6 solve your problem. That is instant communication at its' finest. I hope that you're convinced that computers are after all a great thing. People build everyday life skills, they have fast access to the latest @ORGANIZATION1, and you can keep in touch with people that you don't normally get to talk to. Now, which one of the @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 who don't own a computer are going out to buy one? In conclusion, computers help people through daily life, and I would sure hope you consider purchasing one."
0,"Some ""experts"" are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers. Yet, look at all of the advantages to a computer. You can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, internet with friends/family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my oponion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more & more every day. First off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness timing, and hand-eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their computers. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why buy a ticket to a far away country that's fairly expensive, trade in all your money for the money they have there, go through the hasslels of baggage, ect. When you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? You can go online, look up some of that countries recipes, language, pictures, people without the hassel of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to @LOCATION1, or have to do a report on it, instead of making through countless textbooks, newspapers, libraries in general, they go online, @CAPS1 their country, and they have must, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is getting the information then you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. Leading experts from the @CAPS2.S.A., or Family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like @ORGANIZATION1 and facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re-coonect and get to know one-another. For example, if you have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other/talking face to face. I think this is better then simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick facebook account or @ORGANIZATION1, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures/far away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people."
0,"Dear @CAPS1s times, Computers are being used more and more and this is a problum. Kids are becoming over weight, spending less time with their faimly and freinds, also they spend so much time on the computer they need glasses. Further more. Kids are becoming overweight and studys have shown that @PERCENT1 of kids that are overweight are on the computer for at least @NUM1 ½ hours a day. Dr. @DR1, child nutritionist, said it is imperitane for kids to get out and do any activity that benifits their health such as: football, tennis, running, rideing a bike and many more other activitys. My cousin @PERSON3 from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 says that he and his friends all play the computer more than @NUM1 ½ hours a day, and get no physical exercise. They are overweight by @NUM3 pounds and are still on the verge of gaining more wieght. Glasses, these are needed by @PERCENT2 of kids that are on the computer for exsesief amounts of time. This amount is increasing as we speak. @PERSON2, eye @CAPS2, says that @PERCENT3 of his kids patanter play the computer amounts of time. My cousin @PERSON4 has glasses and says that it is because he played the computer for over @NUM1 ½ hours a day. Interactions with family and freind are important. For example if you are a kid and you are getting cyber bullied you cant tell anyone because you dont trust them and then you go inte depresion. @PERCENT4 of kids being cyber bullied fall into a state of depresson and @PERCENT5 of them comit susaside. @PERSON1, sykiatrist, said that @PERCENT6 of kids being cyber bullied can save them self from depreson by talking to some one they can trust. Computers are a harm to society and are hurting kids around the world. Family and freind are fading off, glasses are preventing the kids from seeing, also more and more kids are overweight thanks to the computer."
0,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to."

0,"Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health, safety and education. To open my statements, overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1 and plays games, goes on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 gained @NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygene declined as well. Another common health problem that developes from excessive use @ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthrietis. Dr. @PERSON3 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, ""The massive amounts @ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthrietis, and other joint related problems."" In fact, a study that took place from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to see the long lasting terms @ORGANIZATION2 computer overuse had some shocking results. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain. These health risks are a concern, but peoples safety is on bigger issue. When people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk. People have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because @ORGANIZATION2 the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2.

When people overuse the computer they can impact their education. The internet hold false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 peoples time. When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? Thats more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had on assignment to do @DATE1. He stood up @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He recieved a zero on that grade.

0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I felt shoeked to see that there are people that beileve that computers don't benefit society and after hearing that I felt compelled to share my opinions. They help socitey. They help us communicate, do important thing have fun. Computers help us communicate in many ways. We all want to talk to our freinds, but we can not be with our freidns all the time, so there is she internet to help us. We also all have freinds we don't see very often, but we still want to talk to them so with is intenet we can talk to them as long as we went. Computers also help us make new freinds. They can also ehlpo us have fun. Computers are fun for many different reasons. Social networking sites, like facebook or myspace, are fun to be on. There are many fun things to do or the internet including video games, many video games consoles are attatched to the intenet so you can play with your freinds. But computers arent just all fun and games. Computers can transfer very important information including homework after schol activities. Computers also hold all of our governments information, from thingsas insignificant as plans for renovation on a town owned building to the department homeland security to the united states of without computers none of that would be possible.

0,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps them learn about foreign places, it allows them to connect with family and friends that live far away, and it helps them with their jobs. Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to @LOCATION4, he wanted to learn about their culture. He went on the computer and researched @CAPS1 culture, so that he can be prepared. How would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it? What if you were to go to that country and do something that was disrespectful to their culture, but you didn't know because you didn't do research on it? I know I would feel bad. Now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has time to sit and read a book. Computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other. I think that's pretty positive. Don't you? People connect with each other through the computer. More than @PERCENT1 of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers. Nowadays there are social networking sites, like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. When I moved to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2, I thought that I was never going to see my best friend again. But then, I got a @CAPS3 and found her on there. I was very estatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. Now everyday I talk to her on the computer. Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in @LOCATION3, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. Another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings. It brings them together and helps them reconnect with each other. Computers help people with their job. Anybody who is a @CAPS6 of a company has a laptop. It helps them store data, files, and important information. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. How would you feel if you owned a company and went on a vacation, but you couldn't keep track of it because you didn't have a computer. Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps learn about places, talk to their family, and keep track of their job."

They teach hand-eye coordination, have easy access to information, and at the same time can have fun, and be social. Computer's most definitely should not be a huge concern. Computer's are a big part with helping with hand-eye coordination. If you are playing a game on a i-@CAPS1 and the goal is @NUM1 lap the bubbies that pop up, than the computer will have made it easier is, bubbies quicker. When you are actually on a computer, you can see and tap the keys on the keyboard quicker because of the better hand-eye coordination you have from computers. Another example is if you are in a rush to leave, as soon as you yhour car keys, grab them quicker. This is because of the hand-efe coordination that was improved from computers. This is not the only way computer back effect on people. Computers give easy access to information. For example, if you need to research information on another. Country for homework, than you can your question this a search engine. Also if you are wondering about the lyric can song, you can type in www.lyrics.com into the internet and they will give you the lyrics needed the . If you are in a debate with family about whether or not @CAPS2 is the capital of @LOCATION1, than you can type the question into a search engine. Computers do more than access information easily. With computers, you can also have fun and of social. A way to be social is cheating with an old friend from camp, or from school on www.facebook.com. If you want enteratinment than you can go on www.youtube.com and watch your new and favorite music videos such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 by @CAPS5, or @CAPS6 @CAPS6 @CAPS6 by @NUM2. If the weather is bad outside, you can always go on www.miniclip.com, to play games. Compters are used for many different reasons; more than just fun and being social. Computers do many things such as help with hand-eye coordination easy access to information, and run and social purposes. Computers have a very positive effect. The only issue is overdosing! the time spend on the computer. If you mange your time wisely so than you do other physical activities, than computers are fantastic!"
0,"Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far to much time on computers. This go for children and adults alike. Just think about it anything you can do on a computer you can do without a computer. That and pepole need to spend mor time outside expiriencing nature. Lastly some bad things can be shown and can happen while online. I chalenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without. You can't even name one. Think about it you can reserch and find pictures from books and magasigns. Insted of social networking sites you can actualy go and see the person or if they are far away you can call them or write them a letter. To find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you like using computer disign programs try drawing a real picture instead. Lastly if you download a lot of music you can just but a cd or better yet go to see the band live. Face it you can't do ehything on a computer that actualy requires the computer. Artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors. On a computer all you can do is watch and even that is nothing compared to the real thing it's just a snapshot of it. Outside you can the gentel breses the warm sun the cool grass, you can smell fresh pine and clean air. You can hear all the other cretures surounding you. Going outside is better for you to. Outside you get exersize and vitimin @CAPS2 while inside you get fat lazy and sick. Can't you see how great the outdoors are? Computers can do more harm than good. They can show children inapropriat pictures and talk about inapropriat topics. They are even now using computers to sell illegal drugs. Children allso often use the internet irrisponsibly and to things that can dissrupt frendships and get them into truble. The computer has also made it alot easyer for kidnappers to find children and kidnapp them. They do this by pretending to be the childs peer then using the information the child him he will make almost a garunteed kidnapping. This is happening more and more frequently. The computer isn't as helpful as you thought. Computers are not realy benificial to our socity. They have no rel use that isn't alredy taken care of. The can not replace the real outdoors. Lastly they can be eisily used for bad even ilegal purpuses. As you can see computers should be used as much as they are being used by the general public."
0,"Computers are very important, I dont know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible."
0,"Dear @PERSON1 weekly, The new millenium brought a new wave of technology. Computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses. The computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country. The computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even home. Also, typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things. The computer is surely a great invention. Have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas? Well the computer is a great source for learning about these places. The effects it has could be significant. One day some one might want to go to the bahamas, but then finds a new location such as @LOCATION1 or even @LOCATION3. In addition the computer benefits students very well. Students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence. When I have an essay to do I always use the computer first. Recently my grandmother moved down to @LOCATION2 and I can only talk to her on the phone. Although on my computer I can actually see her on my screen. The webcam allows me to see me grandma. The computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular bases. For example @CAPS1 or twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school. The computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while. Sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination. The computer makes you better at this. By looking at the screen while typing, gives you a boost on your hand-eye coordination because you are doing two things at once. A sport that requires a lot of this is @CAPS2. While the ball is in the air you must focus on it while holding your stick at the correct position. Although hand-eye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer. To conclude, all that I would like to say is that the computer is a great source for intellegence. It also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family. Finally, the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer is a very important piece of technology."
0,"To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @ORGANIZATION1, almost everyone has them. Computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 they are also a way of communication. I believe people using computers does benifit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep progress of an experiment. Computers help people stay organized. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends. Some people belive people spend to much time on computers. That @MONTH1 be true, but also remember what its doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice. Its not like their being obliged by the @ORGANIZATION1."
0,"Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Some people say that computers are a negitive contributor to society. In @CAPS3 opinion, computers have a positive impact on the world around us. I believe @CAPS4 gives people hand-eye coordination and a way to be organized. Not only those but, people are still interacting with others. if you don't beleve me now, read @CAPS3 details and you'll feel the same way I do. When you consider @CAPS4, computers give us hand-eye coordination. there's no way to use a computer without typing. No matter if you're just typing in a short password or a @NUM1 page essay, you'll alway have to type, and when you do @CAPS4 allows better movement at your hands. This can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise. Since computers have become such a popular thing, i think that in the future, typing or using a computer will be in the @CAPS2. this could be of the hand-eye coordination @CAPS4 gives @CAPS3 theory is whatever you think, you type. in addition to hand-eye coordination, computers provide organization which is a big concern in present day life. Do you have picture files laying your house? Well, there's no need to. With computers you store all and files neatly. how your might you can bark those easy to find everything becomes all that are locate. Even doctors are computers your medical needs and give time. Computers can give organize. Furthermore, computers continue to help instead with store say keep friends I can talk with friends or family far away. @CAPS4 keeps us together and gets I'm not saying that @CAPS4's always a good thing, because we all need face to face interaction. Although when you arent able to get that, its a good way to talk. To conclude, computers positivly effect our lives. We're able to get hand-eye coordination, and stay organized when @CAPS4 can be a trouble to do @CAPS4 can bring people together when they aren't in person. You can learn about new things like people and places far away. though people @MONTH1 think opposite of me, i know that computers benifit society."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 of the new @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to you to inforn you of the rising effects that computers have on citizens around the world. Statistics show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of children who live in the united states spends three hours on the computers every day on computers there are hackers, preditors, stockers and pedifiles. This past year I heard taht @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4 shop constantly on the internet. %@NUM2 out @NUM3 of those people get money stolen from ther account due to hackers. A women of good morning @LOCATION1 stated taht she tried to go grocery shopping online and a hacker got away with ten thousand dollars from her account. This is due to the factor too much time on the computer. Further more on the computer children in fact spend most of the time on blogging sites like facebook, myspace, twitter and aim which comtain adult preditors from the ages @NUM4. Recently I heard a story of a girl who hung herself because of what a grown woman worte about her constantly on myspace. When people are being hurt by others and eventually killing there self due to low self esteem is that benifiting the society? In fact millions of people have one or more of these social networking site and if you're on the computer too long it can happen to you or someone you care dearly for. In addition there ar people who can track were you live and follow you and/or children around caused stockers, stockers can track where you are in a matter of teamwork. As I said before children and adults are on as much as @NUM5 hours. It's very posssible to be stocked over the internet and endangering you're life just by being on the computer to long. Pedifiles are on the internet also. Over the internet many at chat sites they talk to children. What comes out of this is child pornography which is illeageal and is like raoing a child through the internet. When children are raped they usually have terrible lives as adults and take out the anger on others. Some even become pedifiles there serves. Which connects to what I've been reiderating throught this letter. Going on the computer isn't wrong. There's very good educational sites and people do reconnect with long distince freinds through the internet. Too much time is wrong though."
0,"The computer is able to do so many things. It think computers have posotive effects on people. But some experts believe they dont which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people are using computers more often. Some people do not agree that computers are good. I think computers are good though. They help you learn more, they are like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and when you bored you can go on the internet. People nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter. One of the causes is the internet. The internet is like a big book. It holds tons of great information. There's probly information on the internet that probly no one knows, until they read it. Plus the fact that the internet is quick & easy. Also, the internet keeps you up to date on things going on in the world. Without the internet. We would be nowhere. Surveys show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the internet for information or projects for school. Also, on the internet you can buy things you can't but in stores. Going to the library is a pain. You have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library. What if you don't have a library near you? then what will you do? you could go on the internet. Plus, with @CAPS2, people could look for a book all day, not find it and find out that someone else has it. What a pain. There are some people like collage people, Who don't have cars. So how the sapposed to get to the library? Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 don't have cars. When you get bored, what do you do? eat? sleep? Lay on the floor staring at the celing? No. You go on the computer. The internet has all sorts of fun games and websites. It also helps you make new friends. The internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friend or relative. Also, if you are a photographer, then you can sell & share you photographs online you can also advertise you company or buisness. @NUM3 out @NUM4 @CAPS3 either have no backyard or have nothing better to do. I think that the internet is great. You can learn all sorts of information you don't have to go to a library and you can play games when you get bored. Isn't the internet great?"
0,"I use computer all the time and im healthy. Just because you use a computer more than getting exercise dosnt mean your not healthy. I think computers help a lot in life. Now I will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life. Computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no. It will even help you, if you have a job and don't no what time to goin for waste. Computers are also fun. You go to different and play any games. You can also talk to people on them. Or get email with is like getting real mail but from an computer. But there @MONTH1 be some issues, People are useing then to much. They need to get more exirses. So thats what I think of computers hopfuly people will get more exirse now."
0,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you think that computers have bad effect on people today? I know I don't. Over @PERCENT1 of people today have a computer. On a computer you can find great things about a place and people. If you don't have the best handwriting then you can type it and computer can help you look stuff up. @CAPS1 you want to go and look you your favorite hockey player? Instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him. You can just @ORGANIZATION1 his name and hundreds of different websites using will came. That will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of you money. If you go on a family trip each year to the sum. Place you need a change? Then you can look up another place online that @MONTH1 has the same features but it @MONTH1 be way closer then going to @LOCATION1 each year. So, if you have a computer then you can look places you @MONTH1 want to travel to or look up cool facts about your future sport player. If you have messy handwriting and its getting harder and harder for your teacher to read then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today are getting zero on homewrok or test because their teacher can't read their hand writing. If you type it up on a s computer then you will spelling or grammar as you ever you for sizes and color as pictures are make your grade high to the fact you little more work into you die. So, to all the people who think that computer help anyone well reasons why computer can help someone. Computers can help kids find something or can help them computer can also find video about your favorite player or about you favorite hockey players give warning not the playoffs. You can find all good stuff online. You can find your favorite song for your cellphone. Over @PERCENT3 of people get the song from the computer. Also the computer can play the favorite song on the computer. For example if your favorite band was drop kick murpheys then you can @ORGANIZATION1 that are you will find all of their songs. Alot of people think that computer are not good for us. But, I say they are wrong. You can find info about there future person they can look up there. If you have messy handwriting then you can go and type it up lastly you can songs, video, and much more when you browse the web. For example, @LOCATION2, @MONTH1 be there very own website. Computer can help kids find info better we type your paper sloppy."
0,"some people learn about far away places, getting the latest up-dates on important news, and making sloppy work and hand writing seem nice neat. All those thing are some positive benefits people have computers. People all over use computers to research other places computers provide photographs of the place he/she is researching. For example: I remember when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1, and I had to explain why its a great place to visit for its history. Mind I never even heard on a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers I googled ""@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1"", then the computer gave me all of info. and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now I @CAPS2 where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 moutans look like. Secondly, the computers has all the latest news happening all over the world. I remember when the earthquake in haiti first happened my grandmother had it happen until she got on line to check @ORGANIZATION1 and when, where and earthquake on the richter scale. about computers was a I wasn't the best hand writer in class, and could write it out or do it on the computer, plus we were getting graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency. I choose to do it on the computer it came out nice and neat with picturs. computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide. now matter if its for info, news, or to make thing neates."
0,"Dear, Local Newspaper writer I believe that computers benefit our society because we could connect to people more faster and easier. And computers @CAPS1 good for our society because of we don't have to spend to much time on the phone. That @CAPS1 why I think computers benefits our society. ""@CAPS1 computers a good thing or bad thing?"" Computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want too. But sometimes we don't have to be on the computer so long. That @CAPS1 why I think computers are a good thing. Without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message. In my opinion I am really thankful that we have computers. And on computers you could go on everything like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even work on the computer. That @CAPS1 without computers it will be different. I think people are not spending to much time on the computer"", because a lot of people on the computer to do office work. Computer make things a lot easier for us! But sometimes people take advantage over it. That @CAPS1 why I feel people are not spending too much time on the computer. Last but not least that @CAPS1 why I know computers benefit's our society."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion I support the advances in technology. Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers/phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives. We need to know the weather/traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster and help us do things faster. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends / family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills."
0,"Dear Newspaper I disagree with the hole computer thing I think it's just a wast of money and it's a wast of time for kids. That will be the kids will get fat and kids will never want to go out side they will want to play video games, eat junk food. If you stay on the computer for to long, it can make your eyes week and it sometimes can give you canser and you can die from canser or you can get really sick and not die and you will hike @NUM1 sick year of pain. Mostly kids stay on the computer for mores playing stupid games and they will never go out side and they will stay in side for days and never go out side and play with there friends. When they get sick of there games they will want to try and hang out with there friends but they wont be able to they will be to fat and slow. My aunt died from useing a computer to much she had brain cancer and she died she lived for @NUM2 year with the cacer. I felt so bad for my cousin he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer everyday cause that has her job. Therefor I state that computers should not be used for more than @NUM2 houre a day"
0,"Dear editor, People are spending too much time on computers. They should do other activities besides using the computer. Too much computer time is bad because we need to exercise, it damages your brain, and it doesn't let kids do well in school. That is how too much computer time is bad. People need to exercise. In @LOCATION1, there is a problem with obeasity. Many teens, children, and adults are obeast. Instead of them at the computer, they should be out side for a walk and exercising. Also, exersing is healthy rather than sitting at the computer. Thats why people need to exercise instead of use the computer. Editor, you should know that computers damage your brain. For example, people mostly use the computer to play games or to chat with people. With that, you don't learn anything. People should be reading more and doing activities that they can learn something. Going on the computer isn't very educational, thats why too much is bad. Do you realize that too much computer time doesn't let kids do well in school? For example, many kids stay up late on the computer. With that, they either wake up late or fall asleep in class. Also, kids can be so busy on the computer that they wont do their homeworks. The effect of that will be them failing classes. Therefore, too much computer time doesn't let kids do well in school. Thoes are reasons why too much computer time is bad. People need to exercise, it damages your brain, and it doesn't let kids do well in school. Do you think people spend to much time on the computer?"
0,"Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em? By the press of the button, all doors unlocked, by a swith the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats the pencils you we are all made by, the yoou know what! Machines, but programed with computer chips. Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest."
0,"My oponion is computers should be used for many different purpuses. One reason is chating online with friends and family. Another reason is that if you are going far away and you know someone that can give you directions to where you are going then you can chat with them as they give you directions to where them as they give you directions to where your heading. Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can't go an see them then you can chat with them. Another rwson is that of your going somewhere and you don't know the weather for the next day then you can go online and find out what's the weather for that day. Also if people really want to exercise then they can go on there computer and go to youtube and od exercise from there computer. Also if you want to see the @CAPS1 then you can search it on your computer to see what's going on. Lastly if you don't think it's rite for people to have computers then you should try to get one to see how much stuff you can do with it. You will be amazed. This is my reason why people should have computers to enjoy while chating, watching @CAPS1 and many other stuff that you can't probably imagine. Also, maybe kids should not have computers but they can get one when they get older. Also, if kids need to search from school then they can also do that there are many reasons why people should get computers. That my my opinion about why people should have computers."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1? Are you there?"" ""@CAPS2 you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necesity to an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but @CAPS2 they always prove trustworthy? Computers are alwasy reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others...that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you @CAPS2 choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personaly preffered option is @ORGANIZATION2 email. I myself have family in @LOCATION1, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families in @LOCATION2 say they have relatives that are far away. That is @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their famly. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you @CAPS2 interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student of @PERSON1, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that @MONTH1 be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible @CAPS3. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""@CAPS3 are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control,"" says @CAPS4, an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor @CAPS3. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn now things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!"""
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 people have any viruses in there head?"" @CAPS2 they need a maricle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is @CAPS2 its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone's get weaker and when your old you can't move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the time/money people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love computers more than life itself. @PERCENT1 of the world spend their time doing somthing active instead of being on the computer."" @CAPS3 an computer is nice but you got to know that you, can't get controlled by it. ALERT! ALERT!!! Sirence is getting closer and closer to my house. I am getting scared @CAPS2 I am online and i'm wondering if i did anything wrong. But it wasn't me who the cops was coming for, it was my next door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no buisness doing. See computer's can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers effect people. How unhealthy it is, to many people. Why it takes up so much time from people's life. And all the trouble it puts people through."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 of people use computers @CAPS2 for many different types of things. Computers are very beneficial to society. Even though people @MONTH1 use their computers too much, the tasks they complete help our world run smoothly. Also, computers allow us to keep in touch with friends and family that we don't see anymore, and they teach us valuable information very quickly. Without computers, society would not run as smoothly as it does now. One way that computers benefits our society, is that they complete tasks such as writing a paper, researching information,..etc, much quicker. For example, if you, the @ORGANIZATION1, needed to quickly print an article in the paper on the devastating earthquake in @LOCATION1, computers would greatly benefit you because they would allow you to type the article much quicker than having to handwrite it. Computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently. Another reason why computers are very beneficial to society is because they allow us to maintain relationships with people from long distance and allow us to always keep in touch with old friends and family. Moving to from about @DATE1, computers have greatly helped and I stay halfway country. In a recent survey by @PERCENT1 of college graduate a computer stay in town friends from stay in but allow you to actually see the are our society is beneficial by computers because they world. reason society is because they alloe people very quickly. Search engines such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, and more allows us to research anything we want to know at just the click of the button. This ability to know anything very quickly has agreat effect on people, without of this knowledge people becomemore intellectual and intelligent and with that intelligence, they make great things happen. According to @PERSON1, a computer scientist at @ORGANIZATION2, The knowledge people get from computer search engines allows them to better do @CAPS2 things and achive more in thier lives"". Computers benefit society and have great effect on people when they are balanced our with other important things such as exercise and socializing. They teach us new information quickly, perform tasks, quickly and effeciently and allow us to keep in touch with people across the world. If it weren't for computers things would take longer to get done and society would become worse. We need computers to do @CAPS2 things and do tasks needed to live life."""
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that they have a positive effect on people. The reasons why computers have a positive effect on people is because people learn new things, they can interact with their family and friends on a computer, and lastly because using moving the mouse on a computer is containing lots of muscles. One reason why computers have positive effects on people is because some people learn new facts everytime they go on the computer. It is very possible to learn new things on a computer everytime you go on a computer because computers contain lots of information. Learning new facts everytime you go on a computer is a good thing people always, say ""you learn something new everyday"". Everytime someone learns something new they are adding more information into their brain. When you add more ideas in your brain the more you know, and the more you know the smarter you are. Those are @CAPS1 reasons and details of why computers have positive effects on people. The second reason why computers have positive effects on people is because people can interact with their family and friends on a computer. Their are video cameras on laptops where you can view your family from out of the state and you can interact with them instead of traveling. When you use a video camera on a laptop you don't have to call. You do not have to go through so much with buying passports to see family and friends that are out of state when you can get in contact with them over a computer. That is another reason why computers have good effects on people. And lastly another reason why computers have good effects on people is because it takes lots of muscles to move the mouse all over the screen. When it contains muscles to do things it is considered exercizing to me because anything that a person does contains muscles. That is a good thing because exercising is good for you. So movements to a computer does contain exersize. That was the last reason of why computers have good effects on people. @CAPS1 position was stated wich was computers do have good effects on people. I also listed @NUM1 reasons why."
0,"Dear, Newspaper I am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people. Computers make you unhealthy, bullying takes place on the computer, and it effects how you do in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy. I say this because most people don't get enough exercise. Then you get obese from not having enoughb exercise. Eventually you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do. The next reason why lcomputer have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves. Then they all get very depressed. This is called cyber bullying. One example is, is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. his son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school. they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes. Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer. Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. Thats how a computers have on effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy. People gets bullied, and it has on effect on your schoolwork. That is how computers have bad effects on people."
0,"I disagree what people say about computers. Likewise of corse they teach hand eye coordination. But they are not good enough for people. Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people."
0,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have become part of our lives. They are found nearly everywhere in todays society. For many people computers and the internet are a learning tool and a source of entertainment and news. Yes, some believe that over use of computers has a negative impact, but in moderation the internet can be a valuable tool. Computers are a learning tool. You can learn ready anything from the internet, @MONTH1 it be preparing a dish for dinner or fixing something that @MONTH1 be broken. The internet is an instant source of information. Sites such as @ORGANIZATION1 let you type in the name of your topic and find every site with information about it. Many children can learn new things via computers. When I was in a younger grade the teachers had us play computer games that also taught us about our subject. Another important feature that computers contribute is typing. Today, nearly everything is typed. At school nearly every essay we write will need to be typed at some point. Typing teaches hand-eye coordinaton and correct spelling and grammar. But, computers are not only used for learning they are also entertaining. The second main use for the internet is news and entertainment. If someone needs to be updated they can just log on to their computer, laptop or even phone, to get the latest news instantly to them. @MONTH1 it be the news on the @CAPS1' latest speach or just who won the sports tournament, people can have this information at the speed of light. Think of a day when it's cold and raining outside. Instead of being outside in the dark and damp, you can be warm inside watching your favorite shows without any commercials or re-runs, through the internet. The internet is an important tool that can be used for nearly anything. Many of the positive features of computers outwiegh the negative. Computers and the internet have a very positive effect in the right amount. Many of the things that people say computers keep us away from, they can actually help with. Lets say you're going on a trip with your family, you can print out a map and get to your destination twice as last."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 Local newspaper, I heard that you were concerd about people and how they use the computer to much. I think that computers are a good thing to have because many people use computers for school, work ect. I think that computers are good use, many people use it for research and resources. It is easier to use them, when you are going on vaction because you can check out how much hotels are, where resteraunts are, and what interesting places are there, instead of calling/driving around. Computers are good for school because I think books are harder/longer to use than computers. Also for questions you can go to one of the websites an you ask the question and many other people might answer the question your looking for. There also useful for work most people use computers for work. They can put there taxes/documents on there computers. Computers can be used just for fun too. There are chat; facebook games. I think that computers are useful for many things, but I also think that some people spend too much time on them too. Computers are great, but you should also use other things too like maps, book, ect. Many can spend @NUM1 hours on the computer facebooking and gaming. I think that it's important for people to go outside and hang out with friends. Alot of people spend there time on the computer during @DATE1 because its cold and sometimes snowing. I don't think that they should spend there whole time on the computer though because you dont just want to depend on electrictronics everytime. I think that computers should be used not alot in the @DATE2 because I think hanging out with friends and family are important and also the weather nice. I think that computers can be very useful with directions, work, school work but you shouldn't spend alot of time on them. Electronics arent everything in life. Thank you for taking your time reading this and I hope you do agree with me."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I do not believe that computers are helping today's society. I feel computers are making our situation here in @LOCATION1 worse. Now a day's you see less people in parks playing catch or teenagers signing up for there local sports team, because they're too busy signing up for a ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" acount. People are for example when I went to work with my aunt I saw so many adults on their laptos during there lunch brake, instead of enjoying their limited time off to relaxe and get out of the office. Me a s a teenage girl hear my friends always talk about how they meet this cute boy on ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" or ""@CAPS7"". when they don't even know if the boy is a boy at all. So so I don't think that's safe for teenagers or adults. Another example is when I was watching the news yesterday a man was selling his truck on ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". One person took the pffer but they kept on changing the location of were they were going to meet to pick up the car. When tehy finaly picked a location they met. (@CAPS10 was a secluded area). They buyer wasn't planning on buying the car he was going to rob the man and kill him. This proves that the internet isn't safe. My final plea is ther isn't alot of people visiting their families and friends instaed they email them. my opinion is @CAPS10's not the same, you can't spend quality time with a email. You can't send love by instant messaging. I know this because my brother is a @LOCATION2 @CAPS11 and he sends me and my brothe picture mail of him in @LOCATION3. @CAPS10's not the same I will still miss how he would tease me or embarass me infront of my friends and computers and emails will never replace that."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have been complates about computer in are society. They say they are keeping children inside doing nothing, but really they are helping us so much! The internet is where you can resurch anything and tones of helpful ideas come up. @CAPS3, @CAPS5 helps us with hand-eye cordination. Lastly, computers alowe us to stay in touch with people who are far away. Like last year my friend went to poland and we were able to talk threw are computers! So lastly join me and help the world know that computers are good! First off I would like to say the computer is a good source of information. How would you like @CAPS5 if you still had to read scrolls from grene when you could look at on online? Not to manchin not any you need to know some thing really fast like now your stalk is befor a big meeting. Then all you have to do is simple type in what you want to know then bam! Just like that you know, and off to you meeting. Secondly, using the mouse and keys on a computer can incless your hand-eye cordination. Like my parents aways say when i'm typeing on esay, @NUM1 words per minute is a good minute. @CAPS3, out of @NUM2 kids get better hand-eye cordination after geting good on the computer. Alot of times kids have a ten of cordination, but I have a that if kids on the thing will change. Most importantly the computers and faraway like I menchind befor I stayed intouch with my polish buddy @CAPS3, a lot of people don't have cell phones so they have an @CAPS4, gmail, facebook, my space, or a twitter. All of this alows us to stay in touch and keep us up in are friends lives. This is very important because if we are social the we will get out with are friends and do stuff, wich is very important for are. In conclusion, @CAPS5 is good for are society to have computers in are lives. @CAPS5 will help us in the future, we will get good grades on project because of are sources. We will be heathy with hand eye cordination, from the mouse and keybord. Lastly we will have many friends. thes are all very important in. So keep computers!"
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people. For example, children and high school students can use search engines such as google to help them find facts about there topic. Also, if you want to learn about a far away place then you can learn more about it. Computers even give you avilibility to talk with your friends for free. For starters, computers are an extreme tool for children in school. Many kids like to use a computer because its faster than looking for information in a book. Therefore, this will help students in school get better grades. Its important that we keep recognize. That computers are really important. Our computer teacher @PERSON1 tells us ""@NUM1 kids who is computers get better report cards."" Computers are extremly important for children in school but on the other hand its also a great way to find far away locations. To start, haven't you wanted to go on a cruise and want to find the best one? If you have a computer you can find anything you seach. Its great to find the place you are intrested in and wanna visit. For example, i wanted to visit @LOCATION1 so i searched it and i clicked what website i thought was the best. The computer brings to you information fast. Computers help you in many was like finding vaction spots but also a computer lets you chat with friends. The computer lets you chat with friends over the internet. There are safe websites that let download instant messaging. For example, @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2. This is also important for buisnesses, schools, and parents. This is a great way for a big buisness to communicate with each other throughtout the building or parents to talk to each other and there friends. As the gunder of computer said ""I tried to create a safe way to get fast results."" To sum up communicating is important but some people argue people use it to much. Some representives argue that people are spending to much time on computers and not exercising. You should only use a computer for a certain ammount of time and try to maintain exercise throught the day. Spending to much time on the computer is un healthy so try to have time to fit exercise in. Its important that you keep yourself healthy and fit. In conclusion, computers are important for just about everybody. Computers help you find information, vacations, communicate over the internet. This is important for just about everyone. Its important we keep in mind that its an important tool."
0,"Dear local news paper, I think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age. Starting at thirteen and up through adulthood. People spend hours at a time on the computer when they canbe exercising or doing some type of activity out doors. Computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them. Spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person posture. It is said that when some get on a computer a state of comfortbility comes over them and they lean over with their backs bent and they there for periods of time. Imagin a person being cramped in a tight space for eight hours and when that person gets out they all their joints and muscles being stretched from that point of tensions. This is what we do to our bodys when we get on computers."
0,"The effect of people using computers isn't anything bad couse you learn a lot from it. In some ways when you use the computer and you type, the typing exercises your fingers. Your fingers will get muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard. People sometimes using computer is good because if your writing letters you don't have to use pencil you can just type it and print. The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people for example, ir your researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer in a instant click. Computers save time and does a lot of work. Computers are helpful piece of technology and one of the best."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the Use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, But, people are spending to much time on the computer. @CAPS3 opinion is you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that @CAPS2 is easy to get addicted to the computer, I should @CAPS1 I was a person that spent @CAPS3 time @NUM1 on the computer and @CAPS2 wasn't good. You should be safe on the computer because now and days @CAPS2's dangerous @CAPS2 is appalling that people spend More time on the computer than with ther own Family. Don't you agree? Well you shoud, your society, family, and friend should be the most important thing to you. You shouldn't be spending your whole day on the computer, you should be interacting with the people around you. Now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family. That shouldn't be going on. Although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you. You should think about this because this is happening to much in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS3 school say their addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in @CAPS3 community say their addicted to the computer too. Those are very high numbers don't you think? This is terrible and should stop going on. The computer is like a drug, you can get on the computer one time, then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day. The first time you get on the computer you will be addicted to @CAPS2 right away. I'm not saying you should never get on the computer, but be sure you won't get too addicted to @CAPS2 because @CAPS2 can happen very easily. @CAPS3 mother always sayed be safe on the computer"". At first I didn't really @CAPS1 what she meant, but now I @CAPS1. What ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete @CAPS2. So, you should be safe and don't put any thing on the computer if you would want anyone else to see @CAPS2. Anyone can see what you put so you should be safe. Kids are meeting people they don't @CAPS1 and try to meet them. So you should watch out because the computer is the only place @CAPS7 you can lie. Now you should understand @CAPS7 im coming from. You should now agree with me and under stand that people should spend more time you don't get addicted and be safe."""
0,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2't you want to learn about the world around you, research topics, and talk to more people in cyberspace?well all of this you can do with a use at a computer. Computers can gives you information on any topic including exercising and nature lastly using a computer gives you websites to keep in touch with family and friends the technology we have now is great! My first reason for aggreeing with the use of computers is reeping in touch with family and friends. Now-a-days any websites you go an theres a chat regement that means whoever is on that she same time are could chat them so instead of on your family and friends on holidays and gatherings you talk to them every day you want. Also not just website lets you talk to family and friends theres webcams. webcams could actually see the person and talk to them its really really computer is a fantastic idea for keeping in touch. My second search for agreeing with the use of computers is learn things, most importantly being exercise on the computer i understand the reason behind you cant exercise on the computer, this is. but the computer has so many resources to research exercise for you to do and work out so of going out and buying those tapes, just sit home and online and comfort of your own home so the computer is and you could do things from the comfort at your own home. My theird and last reason for agreeing why the use of computers is it lets you explore the world around you comfort at your own home, actually not even leaving your bed. without computers in our we want be able to do projects at school or without having to try the. So finally computers let us see our world with a click a button. So in conclusion I agree with the use of computers.they let us keep in touch with family and friends, also let us research things, like exercising, and lastly let us see our with a click of a button. So why wait another minute and go get a computer and prove disagrees wrongs!"
0,"Did you know that in a recent poll in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers everyday? Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. they would know righ away just by clicking on the internet. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed not only doe computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but @CAPS4 their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely, without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Another positive affect computers have on people, is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging @PERCENT2 of the world video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger realationship nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning"". They are @CAPS4 helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and strss out for forgetting them, @CAPS4, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, malking their knowledge grow further. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. therefore, computers are very positive, since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use them now positively, why stop?"
0,"Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convienient and positive computers are. Did you know @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertianment, such as games, music, and videos. I once has to drive @NUM1 hours to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer, that I played games and watched movies on. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2, which is computers positively affect me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because the all live on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3, this minor set back did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby, and thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born. there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convienient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school, but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snows day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Too bad I didn't know one thing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report but due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, beacuse I only had to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone elses. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits to using computers."
0,"Here is my @CAPS1 I think computers are useful and here are my @NUM1 reasons one kids can talk to their friends @CAPS2 they are punsied. My second reasons is people can go on the computer @CAPS2 they are bored for ex: @CAPS2 a kid beat all teir games and @CAPS2 they are bored they go search for new ones to buy, my final reason is @CAPS2 people want to look up something for something 'like their project but @CAPS2 the labireey is closed they can just copy down the thing they need. My first reason is, kids can talk to their friends on the computer @CAPS2 they are grounded for ex: I was grounded in @DATE1 for slapping my cousion in face but I still got to talk my friends kthen we are still talking but the only way to trick your parterents are to tell you are aking your friend about homework. Myh second reasons is people can go on the computer @CAPS2 they are bored for ex: @CAPS2 a kid beat all his games and he is broded te can go serch for new ones to buy or rent them or play downloadable games for the computer. My final reason is @CAPS2 someone wants to look up something for his or her project and the liebreey is closed for information and copy it down for your project. My conclusion is we need computers to survive without them we will be in the stone age still."
0,"I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I say this because they help out a lot. They have many diffrent capabilities. Read on to find more on why I think that computers have a positive effect. My first reason is that people can communicate with friends they havent seen in a long time. This is a good thing because if you lost contact with a friend you could find him on the internet. Also you can keep touch with friends and family if they go to far places to see to see how they're doing. Lastly, you can keep in contact with pepole you havent seen in years. This is why I think that computers have a positive effect on people. My @CAPS1 reason is you can write stuff and type it into the computer. I think this is good because what if a person has messy handwritting and they have to write something for their job. They can just type it into the computer and and print it and it out neat. Also you can send letters to through the computer. This is another reason why I think that computer a positive effect on people. You should agree with me on this. My last reason uis that if you have a computer you can actually play games that can make you think faster and you can also by things of the internet instead of going to be store. Like if the store ran out of the thing you wanted you could buy it online and stil got it on time. Ang the gmaes @CAPS2 talking about are mind games and prizes that make think harder. Also you actually go to college through the computer. These are my final reasons that i think computers have apositive effect on people. I think you should agree with me and I hope you will computers have a positive effect on people. I dont really se a negative effect that comes out of them. Accept for when hackeers try to hack into your computer. so agree with me and my reason on how computers have a positive effect on people."
0,"Do you really to take away all the help the compoter is it helps the elderly by being able to go to stop and show well watching @CAPS1, or let teens go to school well having breakfast, or even let a man plan his honeymoon well playing poker with his ""boys"". With the computer people who are boise dont always have time to do that stuff and with a click of a mouse they have it. just think about old or cripted people. It @MONTH1 be very hard to go shopping for their own asentionals like food or close. But with the computer they could in last minutes. Without having to leave the room. And in past years I, myself have bought food from stop and shop online it's quite and efective. All from the comfort of your home. Well if you like being comfertable and work to go to school there's another reason you need a computer are being off do online so you could be in you feety pajamas and go to class, because you dont have to leave your room. Or you could use your computer your a lucky man and are gotting marribe you can easily buy your tickets for the plan online and get reservation in @LOCATION1 with just a few clicks and some looking around."
0,"Dear @LOCATION1 citizens: @CAPS1 members of the great country that is the @LOCATION1, you deserve to know the truth about computers. I think that computers are fantastic machines. They allow you to work from home, learn online, and communicate. The @LOCATION1 is full of technology, so we should take advantage of it. First off, computers allow you to work from home. My father is ocasionaly sick, so he cannot go to work. In order to get paid, he logs onto our home computer, and completes his work for the day, instead bieng home sick, resulting in a temporary lapse in pay. Next, computers help you learn online. Dr. @PERSON1 from the @CAPS2 press states, ""Online learning is the foundation of the country."" @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teachers prefer to teach their students online. Some people think that hands on learning is more efficient thant online learning. However, hands on can not teach you what the computer can. Lastly, the computer helps with communication. First, it allows you to talk with friends. Applications like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 are popular for this reason. Also, one can conference with fellow, workers. Email is ideal for this job because it has lightning fast speed to send and recieve documents. Last, computers allow us to give commands to robotic technology. For example, satalites, military drones, and medical tools need computer to function. In conclusion, computers are phenomenal because they allow one to work from home, learn online, and talk to friends. Start using the computer to full advantage! Don't you want flourish by using the computer?"
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased. You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now!"
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers people arnt being active as much, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. One reason this is true is because people are not exercising, they're too busy playing on the computers. People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in the @LOCATION1 because of unnecissary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them. Another reason computers don't have a positive effect on people is because they don't go out and enjoy nature. People spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! No computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often. Thirdly, a reason why computers arn't positive on people is because they're not interacting with other people. Some people are too busy on facebook or myspace, e-mailing or @CAPS3-ing each other. Sometimes they arn't even talking to who they believed they were, it not only dangerous but unhealthy also. Whats wrong with giving someone far away a call? You can actually hear their voice and know its them on the other line! Its rediculous how people will e-mail a friend thats down the street. It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house. The two of you can chat and take a walk, or play a game, not just sit infront of a screen the whole day. Computers make interacting with other people, in person, a lot more difficult. With computers people are not active enough, don't enjoy nature often, or interact with others as much. They simply are not a positive effect on people. You should also agree and let computers stay to perfessionals."
0,"Dear, @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I think the use of computers are good, here are some reasons why? My first reason is you can find stuff online. My second reason is you can have fun. My last reason is you can make @LOCATION1 friends. I will write @NUM1 paragrahs explaining my reasons. Going back to my introduction my first reason was you can find stuff online. If you can't find a job you can go online and find some. If you want to go to college but you have no time you can take classes online. Those are my details to support my reason. My second reason was the computers are so fun. To me they are fun because when you are bored you can play games. If you are not a game person you can play servays. Or you can find out facts. That how I can back up my second reason. My third reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people. You can meet @LOCATION1 people be search them up if you are trying to find a old friend. Or there is social networking such as myspace, facebooks, twitter etc which you can meet @LOCATION1 people. Mostly everyone would like to meet @LOCATION1 people. To end this story my @NUM2 reason was yo can find stuff online, my second reason was you can have fun. My last reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people."
0,"Dear trained readers, @CAPS1't you agree that more and more people use computers. Well I @CAPS2 because it gives us the information we want to see. Recently it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some people @CAPS3 themselves don't really use computers. Without a dout I firmly believe that people that dont use computers should start to use them. but I can understand why same people don't use computers. Maybe they dont know how to use one have better things to @CAPS2, or can't afford one. First of @CAPS5, they dont know how to use one. I remember when my friend was over and I was on a computer. and he @CAPS4 ""@CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use an computer?"" And I @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 who?"" the @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 me, I dont know to use one."" I @CAPS4 well I'll teach you. Since then @CAPS5 my friend does is go on the computer. One day he says to me because of I want to work with computers. this is one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Second of @CAPS5, have better things to @CAPS2. @MONTH1 be someone has a game. for example, I mostly have how time to go on the computer. Usually I have a basketball game or practice I get home from practice and feel exhausled, @CAPS5 I want to @CAPS2 is go to @CAPS6. why parents come have not wanting to @CAPS2 anything. I'll tell you why. Because @CAPS5 that haved They @CAPS2 @CAPS5 day. This is another one of my reasons why people dont use computers. Third of @CAPS5 can't afford one. Some people dont have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to say it. so they can live in a house. When parent's children asle for something parents shoudn't buy it. They buy it so you dont feel hurt. When I'm a @CAPS7 im going to make sure I have enough money to buy it. If not then I guess that child is out of luck. So dont be going where bragging your computer because some can't afford one. This is my last reason why people don't use computers. this is why some people don't use computers now in days. Because they dont know how to use one, have something better to @CAPS2 and can't afford one. By the way; @PERCENT1 of the pupils of @ORGANIZATION1 dont have computers."
0,"Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negitive or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with thier family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wkids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it braker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must streach the negative affect of computers to. "
0,"The @ORGANIZATION1 has many new high-tech technology. Most were invented to cause joy and hapiness. In some cases however, it has gone terribly wronge. The internet is a prime example. People can say whatever they want about who ever they want. Its not right, people can seriously hurt someone. Both mentaly and physicaly. Some @MONTH1 view the human species as the apex preditor, top dog, hunter not huunted. But we are hunted, by are own kind. Online predators pose as someone they are not, they mislead some unsuspecting girl or boy and then make their move. @PERSON2 was on @NUM1 year old girl who loved the internet she would chat with all types of people. One day she met a nice person who claimed to be a @NUM2 year old. @PERSON2 talked with him for hours and hours. On one conversation she told him her team The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 she told him her number was @NUM3 and she had a game next @DATE1. This other ""boy"" researched the team and found @PERSON2's town and state. He made a surprise visit. Turns out this ""boy"" was a @NUM4 year old man. Who had spent @NUM5 years in jail for child abuse. @PERSON2 didn't stand a chance. This all could've been avoided if @PERSON2 knew the dangers of the internet. Although this story seems tragic there are worse things that can happen. When you think of a computer screen do you stop and think ""@CAPS4 makes it run?"" @CAPS5 if you did you wouldn't be staring at it mindlessly for so long. Many people already have trouble seeing so they move the screen closer. The lights that make up a computer screen continuously produce high and low powerlight. When your eye is exposed to light it shrinks or expands to obsurb the right amount of light. With a computer the change is to quick for your eye to follow. It results in @CAPS6 for many. Your physical health is a lot But @CAPS4 about your mental health? Many people use computers and online chatrooms. Sometimes you know these people from school or even work. The internet gives bullies a sense of confidence to say @CAPS4 they want and not have to deal with consiquences. Lets say @PERSON1 resently cheated on a test because he waas stressed about his parents divorse. @CAPS5 one day he loggs on and people from school have found out. They send mean mesages to im about his parents and his intelligence. More and more people pick on him to feel better about themselves. One day @PERSON1 snaps he goes to school with a knife threatening people @CAPS7 mental sanity is gone a long with his dignity. @PERSON1 didn't deserve this the internet spread rumors and encouraged people to pick on him. The internet is a very bad place. Its dangerous and life threatening. Many people don't see the harm until its to late. Not enough people realise the dangers and threats of the internet. They see it as a peaceful place. But its nothing but peaceful."
0,"Dear local newspaper: I am writing this letter to tell you I think computers have a positive effect on people that they benifit in the society. I as a single person think computers benifit the society because they give people the ability to learn about faraway places, can let people talk and chat onlines with other people and can help with education. Now on to making sure you agree with me. First compouts can give people the ability to learn interesting facts on neat stuff about very faraway places that you have never ever herd of befor. For example once I had to do a movie on a forgive country that I knew nothing about so what did I do? I want to the computers. Thier I found many fact and data about the place. Now if I can do that you can to and it will be very quick and very easy. Secondly you can talk to people or live chat with people even if their miles away. Their is many different sites and places to chat too. Like me I go and talk to my friends on @CAPS1, or myspace oncwe in a while. Also lets say you haven'ts seen a relative in a while you realy want to see them. But its allmost impossible to well not anymore."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor. Surely, computers allow you @CAPS2 my cousin on the computer and @CAPS3 important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. You can go on sites that you on your @CAPS4. Show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring. This a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didnt. The time is now! Just think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because no matter what, people will always have time for that."
0,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers do benefits society because if helps people to learn about places all over the world. People also became more sociable, there is classes online and if you have friends or family members that live for, far away from you, you can keep in contact coith them in many ways! My first reason why computers benefit our society is because it helps people to learn about places all over the word. If you go online you reasearch a name of a place and learn history all about it, this kind of websites also include photos. This information might help you for school work and even for publicity. One time I had a @CAPS1 studies project on china the internet helped me find information about history, religion, holldays, places to tour and spend vacation at. Because of the computer I had all the information I needed and got an A on my project. My second reason why computers beefits our society is because it help people become more so dable, for example if you have friends and family members that live on the other side of the world well guess what? you chat and sometimes spend time with them. When I say spend time with them I mean by webcam. Webcam is a device you connect to your computer and it's like a video camara, you just sit in front of if and watchers what you do. If you want to do this with a person the other person must have a webcam too. You can also chat online with people and send pictures to others through email. I have family members in @CAPS2-@CAPS3 that have computers too and I always communicate online with them and look at pictures of my family though they are not near me. It is really fun and you can't do this without an computer. My third reason why computers benefit our society is because some people don't have enough time to drive back and forth to colleges so, @CAPS4 take online classes. Online classes are just like school and you also pay for education just like any other college. I know this because my cousin graduated from high school but is working very hard to have enough money to buy a car that she can drive back and forth to college. She does not want to waste her fine looking and at home doing anything so she goes on her computer and take online college classes. If it wasn't for a computer she would not be learning and taking her education seriously. So, there you have it. Those are some reasons why I think computers benefit our society. with computers people are more sociable, You get education, You can keep in contact with friends and family members all over the world, no matter where they're at. Computers are very useful!"
1,"I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be avalible to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes there are some very offincive items in a library, such as a book about racism to african americans. No, that person who takes offince in those itmes does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and or everybody.      Lets suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As your looking for a book the child reaches to the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right infront of your child. Thats your own fault, not the librarys.     Although many times its not the librarys fault where certain books are at, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking.      I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification, and sign a waver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offince to anybody in which the customer is around.     And that is my view on this subject."
1,"DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES, MAGAZINES, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVE FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFESIVE? I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO. THE REASONE WHY I STATE THIS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BOOKS THAT HELP YOU THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE. THERE ARE RUDE AND HORABLE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD. LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DESION MAKING. NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO.          FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN. I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THRE REAL DEAL. LIKE HOW TEENAGE GIRL BEING A  MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DONT FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORST. BOOKS MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE LIFE OTHER THAN YOU. SO THATS ONE REASON.     SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS IS LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE,  IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VOILENCE AND STUFF THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DONT WANT TO  GO THREW LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALL MY HOOD. AND THIS BOOK TALK ABOUT ALOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD.     THIRDLY, MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF DONT REALLY LIKE TO GET ADVISE OR TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROMBLEMS. AND THEY CAN GET A BOOK OR SOMTHING THAT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING THREW. THOSE BOOKS AND THINGS IS NOT VERY BAD THEY ACTUALLY HELP. AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THEY REALLY NOT BAD THERE LIKE A LITTLE GUIDE TO MANY PEOPLE.     SO IN CONCLUSION DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MAGAZINE, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE. ABOSULTLY NOT BECAUSE THOSE BOOK TALKS ABOUT REAL LIFE AND LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR"
1,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Katherine Paterson.  I agree with her that we shouldn't be able to take a book of the shelf because people find it offensive.  Any book can be found offensive in some way.  If you could just take a book off the shelf because one person found it offensive there might not be any libraries.  Libraries should be able to contain the items they want and what people would enjoy reading, listening, or watching.  If people want a book to be banned from the library how are other people going to be able to read it?  Not all things are offensive to everyone.  If people not agree with the items the library has in it, don't pick it up.  Act like its not there and keep looking for what you came to the library for.  I believe that libraries should contain the items they want, things that are offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be to others, and someone @MONTH1 get something great out of just reading one simple book.     If libraries don't carry the books people want to read why would people go there?  They should carry the books that they think will make a person interested.  If they make sections in the libraries for adults and kids mothers won't have to worry about her child picking up 'that' book.  By making two different sections adults can find the items they want that @MONTH1 be offensive to younger children.  By having a children section adults won't have to look around in a bunch pf children books to find what they need.     What someone might find offensive another person @MONTH1 not.  Libraries can't ban a book because its offensive towards some people.  Other people still enjoying reading the book.  If they can't find the book in the local library because its banned, how are they suppose to read it?  Just because a book might have 'bad' words doesn't mean the material isn't suitable for people to read.  People who like the stuff that people want to ban won't be able to enjoy the books like everyone else.     If this book that people want to be banned is truely great, how would people ever find out?  What if by reading this book it changed your perspective on something huge in your life.  You'd never know because some people found something a little offensive in it.  This simple book @MONTH1 change your outlook on like.  Maybe the writer has gone through something you have and his book can help you get through it.  You won't ever find out because people don't like it.  Thats why libraries should carry every single book they can get their hands on.     I believe that libraries should contain the items they want, things that are offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be to others, and you @MONTH1 get something great out of just reading a simple book.  Libraries should contain any items they want so people don't have to miss out on a great book.  If someone finds a book offensive, don't look at it or read it again.  Who knows? Maybe this book will change your life"
1,"A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things. It's a big resource ; it has a huge variety of help for people. Question is , is everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if there found offensive?     If books, music , or anythingelse on the shelves were found offensive they should be removed off the shelves. They should have a section for those certain kind of materials. To accsess  that certain material you would have to have a librarians permission that way it can't come off offensive to anyone. Your probably asking why you couldn't leave it on the shelf. You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someones cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth. So therefore thats why they would have to be removed.     I do believe they should be remooved for those various reasons. Libraries are a place to go to be used as recources or fun. Everyone who goes to a library should have everything to there needs."
1,"Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries.I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In todays generation everyone has their own opinon on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things.     Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do ? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library.     Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch,and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have differnt interests. Not everyone likes the same things.     In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to librarys' and learn about differnt things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to @CAPS1.If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries can not censor  their materials!     I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public.People are differnt and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opprotunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The librarys' who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have a equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines"
1,"Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials.     I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think.     If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like.     Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book.     I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people."
1,"I think that their should be rooms were certain adult books are at. I think that they should have to be of age to get the books in that section.     I feel strongly that libraries should have every differnt kind of book for anyone. Everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books. If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them.      I think that libraries are for everyone in a community and that not everyone reads and looks at good nice books some look at naughty books and they should have the right to go and check out books like that. When you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions.      I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it.      My conclusion is, if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at. You should be of age for romance novels and darougatory books but for the library they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions"
1,"@NUM1ed     The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic. Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf?     The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, '@CAPS1 were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures). At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be @CAPS1 I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated!          Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?     Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore.     So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away"
1,"No because the writer is explain th way the story really happend.If ur kid ask u the word tell him/her it not a good word to say, r u can take the book back and get him/her a new one.          Say him/her kids comes home from school and say a couse word and u asked him/her were they learned it from. An they said the teacher said it. U can tell the teacher u dont wounting ur him/her reading that book.                                                                Cousing is a way of explain the story better to them i guess."
1,"I think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelves. The reason i dont think that they should be taken off the shelves is because other people @MONTH1 be interested in what another person @MONTH1 think is offensive. Also i dont think the books, music and etc. should be taken off the sheleves, because it might be great to learn new things and important things from.Another reason i dont think books and etc. should be taken off the book shelves that are found offensive, because some @MONTH1 involve what is going on in the world and important facts that people need to know. For example a movie might be on the shelves that has to do with history and what the world was like back in that time. Well if it's found offensive then people can not find out about their history and find facts about the topic.It would not be fair to those who love to read about certain topics, and because the item is found offensive they can't read what they are interested in or trying to find out about a topic. It's just not fair to take away other people's options of reading and searching for what they want to know about."
1,"Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc. People have differnt views on differnt things.     Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too"
1,"We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you?  Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.      We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.      I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me.     We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them."
1,"Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines.  These books, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf?      If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow.  If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf.  One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you, but @MONTH1 not to another person.     A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world.  I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all. That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes"
1,"Writing, music, and production. All three of those are a form of a certain art. Litterary art, musical art, and visual art. People make artwork for the world to see and hear. And when people begin to complain about the content of a certain artwork, it is censored.     I do not agree with removing books, movies, music, magazines, nor anything else from shelves if someone finds them offensive. Someone took the time out of their life and put together what they believed was a well thought out idea and created it. How did they get that book, movie, music, or magazine on a shelf? Someone else thought their idea of whatever kind of artwork is it was a good idea, meaning more than just them enjoy it.     I, myself, am a music artist. I write music and play it with my band. Alot of time, hard work, and all around dedication is taken to achieve but @NUM1 song fully written. So say my band and I take the time to put together an album of our music. That music would be sent in to a recod label. Now lets say the record label signs us. That label would find places to put that music on the shelves of certain stores so that a consumer could purchase that music. Ultimately, it is the consumer who judges what artwork they obtain.     What if the consumer was offended by the music the record label put out? Well here @MONTH1 be a better point. If the consumer was offended by the content of that art work, why did they purchase it? It isn't their right to buy artwork they are offended by just to complain about it to try and have it removed. This situation can be easily avoided if that consumer avoided that artwork.      Why should only a few people who complain have the time and hard work of others censored by the media? It's just not fair to the artist! Alot of dedication and time is in the creation process of their work. And for someone to obtain it, complain about it, and ultimately try to have it removed it just wrong and ridiculously unjust. There is NO excuse for why people do that. The easiest wasy to keep from being offended is staying clear of that which you do not like/ offends you."
1,"Citizens have the right to choose the books, music, movies, magazines, etc. as they please.  If a citizen knows that they will find one the above offensive they should not choose that item. People know their own morals and if something is obviously against your beliefs don't choose it. Why should everyone else suffer because a few people find a book, music, movies, magaizens, etc offensive?     First of all, when you enter a store or library to get a book, music, movies, magazines, etc you usually read the back of the item to see what the item contains. If a person knows they do not like the content of the item don't rent or buy it. Most items the have some source of entertainment have age groups that the item is meant for or they have a rating and if it don't fall into your category find something that does suit you. We usually know what kind of genre we are entertained by and we choose things in the same category, that doesn't mean you are forced to choose something that you don't want.         Secondly, some say children who go to the library are exposed to offensive books. Well, I say that those children know what their parents would or would not allow them to read. As a parent you should keep track of what your child is reading, watching, or listening to. If certain language or use of literature is against your beliefs then you should know what kind of music you like. For example, if you are a religious person who does not believe in volgure language I do not believe you are going to get a @CAPS1 by a rap singer. If you do not want your child exposed to nudity then I suggest that you look at the movies rating and see if it @NUM1 or @CAPS2-@CAPS3.     Lastly, certain groups of people do not find vulgure language, graphic content, or nudity offensive. They find certain genres interesting that others do not and that is their source of entertainment, why should their entertainment be taken away because of someone elses thoughts? Yes, some of the content is unappropriate to some but it is freedom of choice. Young children are not allowed to by movies that are @CAPS3 above their age levels. Parents are usually at stores with their children when they buy music, it is the job of the parent to monitor their child.     People in the @LOCATION1 have a choice on what they want to read, watch, or listen to and it is not a choice made by anyone else but, ones self. I do not agree with the fact that because you do not want your child to be exposed to certain information that everyone else that does want to be entertained by that information should be punished. Just because people do not agree with the use of alcoholic beverages, do they get banned from the shelves of stores? No, they don't because some people do like alcoholic beverages and not everyone suffers because the likings and dislikings of people."
1,"My @CAPS1, for Censorship in Libraries @CAPS2, i think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because if they are at a local @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it will not be prohibited for @ORGANIZATION1 use because of the state law. And again i do not believe they should remove certain books from the libary shelves because students love to read books of course in like to get into magazines, sports books, etc.Everyone likes to read different kind of books there are many things people love to do besides reading a book I dont even know why, they should remove the books from local places because what if there wasn't any books in the libaries there would be nothing for students to look at or even read by all the expectations iv'e seen going on at @ORGANIZATION1 to tell you the truth i don't think there should be any @ORGANIZATION1 rules at ''NO @ORGANIZATION1''. that's why the @ORGANIZATION2 should let me run for president if i was and charge of anything only thing people would have to pay for is @CAPS3,@CAPS4, Etc. From my experience, i do not believe magazines,books,materials should be taken off of shelves"
1,"What is a library?  A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc.  With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment.  Should there be censorship in libraries?     In my opinion there should be very @CAPS2 censorship in a library.  If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library.  Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream.  They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book.     However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately.  For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it.  What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard.  If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room.     If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures.  For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf.     Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar.  While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended"
1,"I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been. People have the right to read or watch what they want to. I thought thats why we are @CAPS1. Our public libraries have always been safe and clean enviornments and if its not broke dont fix it.      I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it.      People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not.      Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit.      My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are. In the end, more people will be unhappy of a change than the happier it makes people after the change. in other words the numbers of people who are happy with the change will be out weighed greatly with the people who are unhappy. If its not broke then dont fix it"
1,"In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests. At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern. If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad.      I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area. If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming. In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens smaller amounts of people will come.      In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people  have many interesting in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people. Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library."
1,"Dear newspaper and staff,               @CAPS1 has came to my attention that @CAPS1 is being considered that most libraries in the community @MONTH1 have a removal and or censorship of some books in the libary. I find this not accepable; in my opinion this is a attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offenisve reading material from futher generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1', this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics. Books of this sort are not only imformitive @CAPS1 also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been. Some topics @MONTH1 include; slavery, abuse, war, and discrimation.                These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society. Censoring and removal of these book are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. @CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised. Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent!          My opinion on movies however are a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating. They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie.           So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues. I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed. I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks!                                              Sincerly,                                                                                     @PERSON1- @ORGANIZATION1"
1,"I feel that some books have grusome language, imagery, and so on. I also feel that whatever someone wants to write is freedom of speech. So therefore whatever they write can be written and published, but if it has certain types of literature it should be sold under warning or in an adult bookstore. I am a firm believer in freedom of speech. I really think that @PERSON1 is a great writer and so do millions of others, you don't hear people talking bad about him.     I'm simply suggesting that we separate our literature into genres. I feel that if we put books with certain language and grammar on shelves of stores that children can't get into maybe they wouldn't read it, unless their parents supervise. Like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for instance, they are taking all of the old copies off the shelves and throwing them out because of the word nigger. I mean they are right, it is not a good word to use, but it is original in that book. Now it is going to be one of those refurbished copied craps. That upsets people, and some do not understand.     I personally feel that if we take books off of shelves for good instead of distributing them from stores that have an age limit to enter, then there will be no books left out there that have good stories, and imagery. Alot of people like the grusome imagery of @PERSON1. He will never be taken off the shelves for good, maybe from certain stores, but he will always be a legendary author. I feel that if you don't like your children reading it, do not buy it, if you find it offensive, do not read it."
1,"Should offensive books be taken off the shelves? Do we have to worry about little children reading these books?  I beileve that every book needs to stay in the library. Should little children be allowed to read those books, absolutly not.     Offensive books should not be removed because a couple of worried mothers say so. Offensive materials are apart of everyday life and sooner or later children will grow up. Offensive materials are extremly not for children but taking them out of a library limits the usage for another grown adults. Offensive materials do have a place in the library maybe not in the childrens section but a place.          Usally libraries have a place for children. These 'children's books only' areas help restrict your child from reading something offensive. Most libraries have big sections that are just for children too. If your library does not have one of these sections then talk to them. Ask your local librarian to open a children's area.      Most libraries do not even allow a child to have a library card and if you do not really trust your child then you might not even want to give him/her a card anyways. You can always go with your child to pick up a book or magazine just to make sure it's not rude or offensive. You could also pick up a book yourself so you would not have to worry.           As I have stated if we took offensive books off the shelves what would adults read? There would be no fair justice to the other part of the libraries people. I understand that no one wants their child reading something with rude behavior or offensive actions, but would a single woman/man with no children like that idea? No. We have to keep all the materials the library has to make it fair to everyone. Remember if your libary does not have a section just for children, speak up."
1,"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject."
1,"None of us wanting our kids reading inappropriate book or magazines or listening to bad music. No one wants to walk in a library and see something that could offend someone or themselves at the library. Some things at the library shouldn't be on the shelves.     The libraries should be considerate of the kids and/or people who could be offended by the things they have on the shelves. Things that are inappropriate for kids should be in a seperate room that they need their parents permition to go into. Also in that room should be things that could offend people, such as books that are about religion. Some poeple @MONTH1 be very offended by the books that talk bad about their religion.     We all know that people can get very deffensive about their kids and their religon etc. Libraries need to think about how these people react and think about if they want their library to be a place where people dont let their kids go because of some inappropriate or offensive things.     From experience we all know that we have went into a library and seen a kid looking at something inappropriate, or you are looking around and see something that you would never let your kid look at. Also you @MONTH1 have seen someone who has been offended by a book, movie, cd, etc.      Most people see a library as somewhere that you go with you kids or family or even by yourself to read, work on homework, or just enjoy the quiet. People dont think of a library as a bad place. That is until they see something they dont like.     People want the library to be a wonderful kid friendly place that they can relax at. Libraries need to think about these things. So to all the libraries out there, make it a wonderful place. Put the inappropriate and offensive things away"
1,"Censorship in Libraries     I know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. There is all different kinds of stuff in there. From children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?     I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library. Nobody can really help with what people @MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for? I like books better then internet myself. Anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public.     If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there. All the libraries I've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's. If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. Make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there"
1,"Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is what makes our world so individualized.     Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors woud leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things.     This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1.     Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people.     This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds"
1,I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive. The books and media help the human race sympathize with eachother and know about things that already happend so that we don't repeat history and do it all over again. Some books are made up for entertainment and others are for education and help children learn about what happend in the past.Taking books off the shelfs of schools and libraries would be uncalled for because you are taking away from children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and knowing what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms. Books that are offensive should be taken off the shelves but not the books that make sense to people and help you suceed in life.         some schools don't have books to read because they are in a poor country and don't have much to do besides go to school and learn. books are important in so many ways that it would be a lot of drama if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who done it. some books don't make sense but that doesent matter if it does or don't.
1,"Censorship in libraries should not be mandated. Censorship should not block the the 'allegory' in some books that the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader. Censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 just like in @DATE1'. You could not the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art.     The word definition of allegory is a story within a story. It is where the author is trying to show to the reader. For example like in the book '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2' is an allegory. It shows many storys tying in with each other. When @ORGANIZATION3 dies on the side of the cliff by @CAPS3 when he launches the huge rock over board. That shows the fall of man. In the @CAPS4 where @CAPS5 eats the apple from the tree and that is why we sin. You just cannot censor such a great book. Very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other. Everyone needs to look at both sides of the story. People need to know the true meaning of what is being said.     Art should not be censored at all. Art is what makes people creative. The way artists make things abstract that could kindle some controversy. Also they make things that we use today that we just don't think about, that are utilitarion. Who would give you the right to censor thier master pieces. For example @ORGANIZATION2 had a dark period in his work and painted demon's in his paintings and people might think that is way too graffic. People need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time.     Censorship is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This would to a book called '@DATE1' by @PERSON1. In his book he show complete govnerment @ORGANIZATION1. We as the people of our goverment would be classified as the '@CAPS6'. The @CAPS6 made the majority of the people and were not very smart people. Also could not think for themselves because the @ORGANIZATION1 censored everything you could think of. The @ORGANIZATION1 did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the @ORGANIZATION1. They knew that @CAPS6 could over throw them, but they were on top of their game and censored everying. This is what would happen if we censored everything. We all would have not personality at all. No one could express love the way we do now.      Censorship would in libraries would not be the most best thing anyone should do. No one would know what an author would be leading too, not a single artist could display their art. Aslo censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This could not work in our society today. So censorship is not the best idea anyone could think of."
1,"I think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive. I think it should be that way about every thing. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time.      Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is. I rairly change my ways though. Some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two?      This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offened. I do know some people the get offened easy though. I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time. To me thats no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa. I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know.     If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again. It might not offened the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you. After a wile you will forget about it. I guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. If there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay."
1,"i think some books should be taken off the sheleves because of the way the use racial remarks, use of a lot of bad language, and the way the use drugs in some of there books. they should be setting a good example for us, as in teenagers. they are making it seem like they want to promote drugs, sex, ect. to even small kids that they dont even know what sex is, they still think that kissing is still bad.      i know if it was one of the author's child and he/she was reading something like that, @NUM1 times out of @NUM2 the author is gonna be mad cause they are same situation as a concern parent. a lot of music is either talking about sex and drugs. it all started in the mid @NUM3's- early @NUM4's. thats what almost ever song back then was talking about was either sex or a type of drug. now songs in this time they are still talk about the same thing as they did in the @NUM3's-@NUM4's.     i wouldnt want my son, daughter, neice, or nephe, reading something like that or listening to music like that at a young age. if you really think about it everywhere you go someone is promoting sex and drugs. wether is having condoms sold at a store or promoting beer thats on sale. everywhere you go one of those to things will fall into play. be careful cause someone might be watching you so choose wisely the choice that you make in life cause one little choice can and will mess up your @CAPS1 life. wether is playing the sport you love on a full ride of even if its a little bit of a scholarship"
1,"I think that it is dumb to remove all of the books that some people find offensive, because what if other people find it interesting? If they move all of those books, what will they find that will be suitable for them? I think that the people who find stuff offensive should just leave it alone and go about their own business. How would you like it if you spent all your hard earned work on a book just for someone to get mad and take it away? It do not make any sense and it is not right.     First, say someone on a daily basis comes to check out a certain type of book that they find interesting, and one day they come there and it is banned or something. What if that person was you? You would be pretty mad right? I know I will. So what if you find a topic offensive, it wasn't exactly aimed at you now was it? Probably not, so you should just not worry about it.      Second, if you see a book on a shelf that offends you, I think the best thing for you to do is just ignore it and go on in your life. There are going to be thousands of things on earth that can offend you, but you can not take them all out. I mean you can try but will you be sucessful at it? You can be sucessful at a few but there will always be more that comes up, so why try.     Last, why would you try to take away some elses hard earned work? Put your self in their position, you will be mad if you come to find out that your book/music/movie or something else has be canceled because somebody did not like it.Thats messed up right? What about the hundreds or even thousands or more of people that liked it finds out that its gone because of you, and worse they even know that you had something to with it. Now you have alot of people hating you because of your opinion. I'm not saying to keep your opinion  to yourself , but with situations like this it's best to.     In conclusion, I think that it is not a good idea to do such a thing. Just think of all the worse outcomes that you can bring opon your self, like having a lot of people against you because you took something away from them that they liked, or taking away a aurthors dream. Just don't worry about it, there are millions of other stuff that interest you besides the one that don't.  This little movement can have the biggest impact on you and others lives."
1,"Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have. Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living.      Lets start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of @NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that @MONTH1 be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.     Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it. Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.     The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have.     The last one is magazines. There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble.     Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library."
1,"Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries? No, I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them. If the person complains about a book, music,movies or anything then they  should not go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be aloud in the library.     When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awsome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal. When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians. He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave. I read the book and I thought there was nothing offeensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free.        My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People that do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book. That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries."
1,"I THINK THAT IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFINSIVE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T READ IT. CAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THAT BOOK . MAYBE IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM,MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THIER LIFE.  WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES, SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT TO THE AUTHER AND TALK TO HIM\HER. ABOUT THEIR BOOK.  THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRIGHTING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATEING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK ,ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSONSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO NO I DON'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/ BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVESCAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN.                                            THE END."
1,"Yes I do believe that certain materials should be censored.The reason behind this is.      One reason is that they should use censorship is because what if a book had cusing in it, and a little kid grab the book and started reading it. Some more things is censorship is good for it blocks out all the bad things.      Reason two is that censoring things on televison. Can be a good thing too because, what if a little kid is watching. While he is watching the t.v he might pick up on those bad words.     The third reason is that using censorship on music can be a good thing. The reason why is that. You wouldn't want a little kid picking up any new words.      These are some of my reson and opinons on censorship"
1,I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant.  Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk.  Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow.  A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law.  On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children.  For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+.  I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if  you want to change them or not
1,"The Shelves     'No! Don't look at that!', is @CAPS1 I remember my mother yelling one day at the library. My sister was young and picked up a magazine, off the library shelf, that she should not of been looking at. This can effect kids all over, libraries should be censored. There are many things that children's eyes should not see, many offensive books towards a certain group of people, and books that just should not be allowed to be sold,or rented, in libraries.      Censorship in libraries? Some @MONTH1 ask why, @CAPS1 is it hurting? They have never been censored before why start now? The reason is because more and more kids are getting into things they should not be at a younger age. This is due to the resources they are able to get to in libraries, at home, or even just advertisements. Libraries should be a place where parents can drop their kids off and not worry if they will be getting into trouble, or seeing and researching things they should not just because they have access to them. This does not only effect kids, some books that are written can be offensive towards a certain type of people. Those people @MONTH1 get offended by @CAPS1 the author says and the library @MONTH1 lose a customer. Then you have those books, magazines, movies, etc., that the general public is allowed to get. There are some things that just should not be allowed in libraries. '@CAPS1 if all the books are censored out? Then there would be nothing left.' The library should have resrticted sections and only allow those who are elligable to those sections. Being censored does not mean that every book, or magazine or whatever, has to be taking out of the libraries, it simply means that the ones that are open to public should meet a certain criteria.     If all of our libraries were censored our public would be better off. We would not have to worry about sending kids to the libraries hoping they do not see thing they should not. We would not have to worry about offending people. Should libraries be censored? In my opinion they definitely should be cencored."
1,"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news."
1,"Many @CAPS1 believe that they should know what kind of material their children are reading, listening to, and watching. But how can this be accomplished for all people to choose what is available for them? That is where a quote by author Katherine Paterson comes into play, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhore-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.' @CAPS2 is saying, through this quote, that if one person had the right to remove something off of a shelf then everyone has that right. But if everyone has that right then very few to zero materials would be left. So @CAPS1 should have the final say in what is being displayed to their children becuase it is their children who are being influenced in this society.       There is a limit to what can be sensored from the children of this day. There is an abundance of material that is available at their fingertips, most of which is not appropriate for their age category. Once a child has viewed an inappropriate magazine cover, or heard an inappropriate song, etc., it @MONTH1 forever be engraved in their minds. Is that what we want our children to be thinking of? Personally I think that @CAPS1 should have the right to choose how to raise their children, and part of that is determined by what children are seeing on magazine covers in checkout isles in the store, the music that is played in public areas and movies that are showed to them at schools.      The real question is where do you create the boundry line? Who should be deciding what is appropriate for children to view? People have different beliefs in how to raise their children. Some children have practically no boundries and are free to do as they please. While on the other hand some children have an abundance of rules about what they can or cannot do, see or view. While there is an absurdity to somethings that are availlable, there is also a practicallity to letting children see what the world is like. But there is no easy way of making sure that your innocent @NUM1 year-old doesn't see that practically nude woman on a magazine cover as you check out. @CAPS1 should have the final authority of what their children view on a day to day basis. Part of a @CAPS1 job is to make sure their children aren't growing up to fast, and by being exposed to some of these things will absolutely have an influence on how fast they develop in terms of what they think about.       I believe that if a majority of people find a book, movie, magazine, music, or any type of media, etc., to be offensive we have the right as citizens to have them removed from our public areas. If any music or type of media is overwhelmingly filled with language that is hardly appropriate for adults, then it should definitelly be removed from any childs availability. The same would apply to any books or magazines, but also the use of nude pictures, or almost nude pictures is extremely unneccessary in any use. Any pornographic material should not be available to children, especially those who are very young. The content of the questionable items that are believed to be inappropriate should be reviewed and then taken out of the viewing area if a majority of people believe it to be inappropriate.      In conclusion I believe that @CAPS1 should have the final say in what is displayed for their children to see. As a @CAPS3 I believe that children should not be viewing some of the things that they are able to see at this point in their life. Some of the material displayed is not healthy for anyone to be seeing let alone children. When you enter a library you want to enter a place theat is a safe environment for your children, not a place that you have to be worried about what they @MONTH1 see or hear. So I believe that if a majority of people believe something to be offensive to them it should be heavily considered to be removed from the shelf or taken out of the viewing area"
1,"Many people have been asking if censorship in libraries should be done. which means that some material such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed because they are offensive to people in some way. Each book is individually inspected and checked if it is approrpriate for that age of students, so this shouldn't be a problem at all. If so happens something offensive in the library does show up, it was most likely put there on purpose.Yes this is true and it does rarely happen. It is understandable that some books about history could be shown as offensive, but it is real @CAPS3 and it is educational. If there is something offensive in the libraries that students shouldn't read, then yes, censorship libraries in school as much as is needed.     Primarily, extremely graphic, offensive, or grusome piece of literature that is found in the library brings a bad image to the school/library. For example, suppose a student walks into the library and wants to pick up a magazine, and some how, a pornographic magazine appears. That kind of literature should not even be found in the school, and not in a library either. If a person from the school board or someone of importance comes to school to examine what students are reading, that school would get into a lot of trouble. Even books about history could be seen as offensive(to some extent) because it's @CAPS3 and it already happened. Sure things that are read @MONTH1 be 'hard to swallow' but it's something that was written to educate not discriminate. That is the first reason censorship in libraries should be allowed.     Additionally, the literature in schools/libraries @MONTH1 be racist or stereotypical. There are many books that portray this kind of writing, yet its presence is not very seen in school libraries. Books that have to do with gang violence or drugs @MONTH1 also be offensive.For example, the book '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' is about an ex-gangbanger from @LOCATION1, and yes it is available to read from school libraries for educational purposes, since it speaks about his @CAPS3 and shows how being in a gang is horrible decision. Most people would not be offended by it, but there are students in gangs and they might be offended by it. Yes this is very hard to belive but it's the sad truth. Another example would be a book that talks about slavery, or immigration, maybe even The @CAPS4, and that @MONTH1 offend a lot of students, since their ethnicity was part of those events. Even though they pesonally were not part of it, maybe their family was.That could be a potentially good reason to censor libraries.     Finally, not censoring students from reading material that is offensive to them, could put ideas into their minds, and even configure those ideas into their lives. A teenager's brain(in this case) is very drawn in to ideas that seem fun to them but are dangerous to their well-being. For example, let's say a student had never drank, smoked, etc. and they read a book about marijuana and decide to try it. Not exactly is it entirely the author's fault but it could of influenced what the student was thinking. Because of that the student @MONTH1 be kicked out of school, or worse. Literature has a great influence on the generation of today, and that is extremely true. That is the final reason libraries should be censored of offensive material.     In conclusion, libraries should be censored from graphic material because, it brings a bad image to schools or libraries. Another is that the material @MONTH1 be racist or stereotypical to the reader. Then finally, it could put ideas into the student/reader's head and @MONTH1 be applied into their lifestyles. censorship in libraries is no joke and should be taken seriously, to protect students and readers from material, that @MONTH1 emotionally hurt them, and could even change their lives."
1,"Offinsive creations offf shelves?      '@CAPS1!!!!!!!!!They have taken my favorite magazine off the shelf. I think they just did that because the publisher was talking about people in bad way, but they still should not have taken it off the shelf.' @CAPS2 is what i would say if they took offensive thinkgs off the shelfs. In life most things, especially music and magazines, can be offensive but in the music, books, etc., it tells the truth some times and its just someone saying theur opinon on something. I think they should keep nonoffensive and offensive things on he shelf.      It is true, most music is not age appropriate for most kids these days. There are kids in @CAPS2 time that walk around singin about sex, drugs, or killing somebody. I am sure that parents donot want their kids speaking in violence like that. Yes, most parents would not let there kids listen to certain music, others would just let them listen to it and tell them that it is just a song and you should not go out doing something a song is talking about. With @CAPS2 offensive music i think it all comes down to how the parents raise their kids. If  yuor child is not like the music they listen to then the parents should just let them listen to the music they like. every body has their own style.     Also, I would think for a child to go to the library they should be with their parents and their parents would have to check the book out for them. If a pearent sees his/her child try to pic up an inapprpriate book they should explain to them that they are to young to be reading things like @CAPS2. When I was fourteen my mother had @CAPS2 book that i wanted to read. She said i was too young to read that book because it alks about sex. When i turned @NUM1 she finally let me read the book and now i finally understand why i could not read that book when i was younger. When she said it had sex in the book i thought she meant it would say something like how somebody was going to have sex and start talking about something else. When I read the book it gave details to how they was having sex and I realized my mother was right I was too young at the time.      Next, the magazines. I think offensive or not that the magazines should stay on the shelfs bcause they are very informative. They let you know everything that is happening with the famous people,what movie will be coming out soon, and you find good insiders. It seeems like the world would be a bit different with out offensive things in life. We need offensive to balance out all the good.      Finishing with my final thought, i would tlike to say we should keep the good and the bad on the shelfs. I think if we had just all nonoffensive things it would be more boring than it is with the offensive things. Like i said good and bad balances everything out just right. If the press, media, rappers or singer, writters even drawers, have something offensive to say it is okay because it is a good thing behind every bad thing."
1,"Some people like books, movies, music, and magazines with offenses in them. Personally, I do not. I believe that if there is bad material, or material that upsets or hurts someone in these items then they shouldn't be on a shelf at a library.     Offenses like racism and porn are both not good things that occur. They both cause many problems throughout the world. So why should we be putting it on shelves for anyone to see or hear about? We don't want people to think that it is a good thing when it's not.      Of course people do have a choice in what movie, or book they select, but what if it's someone who dosn't know what might be in the book or movie. They could be naive and not know what it is until they read or watch it and then they find out. That is not good for somone, especially if they are young. For example, I have gotton a couple of books from the library that look like a good books. Then I start reading it and it comes to a part where two people are making love. Then it goes into detail. I didn't know that the book was going to come to that. Then I wish I wouldn't have gotton that book.      Another main point is rap music. Some of it is not to bad. Alot of it though, tells alot of personal things that you are supposed to share with someone. I have observed that alot of rappers are @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So some people are racist because they believe that all @CAPS1 @CAPS4 are that way.       If they still put out offensive items on shelves of libraries and stores, then they should at least make a section for those kind of things. It isn't fair for someone to have to see these things when they don't want to. It would be alot better off if they just eliminated them all together"
1,"I think censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be removed from people who have yet to mature, unless a parent or gardian approves of it.     I think censorship can be a positive things for little children and younger folk because kids that are young of age should not view or listen to things such as bad things. These things can be a negitive influence on the child's character and personallity.    No one should hear other kids cursing in public becuase this can influence other kid to do the same. I know my parents don't want to hear me say or do bad things around my younger siblings becuase this can influence them more to do it too than if some kid was saying or doing bad things.      Some censorship shouldn't be aloud to those who are matuered, such as in high school where you have to get a signature from a parent to see some things that should not be shown to little kids becuase older people have matured and they understand why not to be a bad influence on people.     Censorship of certain materials, books , musicm magazines, ect., that are offensive should be removed from people that have yet to mature, unless with parrent concent. People who have not matured should not view or listen to any thing that is a negitive influence on themselves."
1,"There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act.     @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library?      Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.      If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.      Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.      Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else."
1,"Dear Newspaper,     I don't think there should be censorship at all. Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy. Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist. Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone? It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie.      There are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries. My first reason is freedom of speech. People have the right to say or write whatever they believe. Just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend. Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to.     Also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way. By using Censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves. Not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them. If no one can read the books, no one learns.     One more thing to take into consideration, is the authors money. Alot of times in the library if I see a book I really like, I'll go buy it. But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them. The author's write these books so they can make a point and make money. If we take the books down, they dont make money and they dont make their intended point.     In conclution I think censory is overall a bad idea. One because of freedom of speech. Second is it could possibly drastically effect literature. Third is its taking away authors money and point of view. These are the important reasons I do not surrport censory."
1,"Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet.Adults do not need censorship. There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read.Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections, children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear. Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion."
1,"Censorship or No Censorship    You walk through huge metal and glass doors. As you do so your eyes fall upon huge shelves full of books, magazines, movies, music and everything else that you could imagine. Then you  proceed to walk in and out through the various forms of liturature gently touching the spines of each book, magazine, movie case, music case. But suddenly something unusal catches your eye, the sight stuns you at first. What sight would be so stunning that it would make you stop in your tracks immediatly? The answer is, the sight of your favorite section being censored. Just imagine; all of the books being taken away, all of the music being thrown out, magazines being thrown into dumpsters and so on with all of the other forms of writting, speeches, songs, and acting. That @MONTH1 be okay with others, but it's not okay with me.     How many books have you read? How many of those books did you like? How many of those books, that you liked, could be offensive to someone other than you? the chances are that everyone has probably read at least two books that could be offensive to someone else. But the chances are much greater that someone could read that book and possibly have a good reaction and maybe even be changed for the better. Take @PERSON1's book of theories of evolution as example. The book could being offensive to someone who believes in a higher power and they might think that their religion's bible is the one and only story. But to a medical, science or even history student the book could help them understand their field of study and research better. Therefore, making one side strongly against the book, but one side strongly in favor of the book. No matter which side you're on, one will almost always lose to censorship.     During the time of presidents such as @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1 and various other there has always been a war under the surface and it's name was censorship. It went further than most would think. It went to files, books, music, and eventually movies and magazines. When @CAPS1 was president there was censorship with books and newspapers galor. The books would be censored when something was considered racist, un-american or even political. The newspapers would be censored when an article was considered political, racist, un-american, rude, kind and an other reason you could possibly think of. Another case of censorship was when a famous singer was not allowed to sing for the president and first lady because of her ethnic background. Finally the first lady's persuasion was enough to get her favorite singer to sing for her with one complication, the singer had to sing outside on the front steps instead of inside like past performers had.     The new victims that are falling to censorship is music, movies and magazines. Where the main reason why the past forms of liturature were to be censored was on ethnic backgrounds and racism; it has no been shifted to gay, straight, bi, lesbian and other sexualities. This @MONTH1 not effect some people, but it could change someone's life by helping then realize who they are. A sad part is that this could also go in reverse it could open an oppurtunity for bullying. Again no matter which side someone is on, somebody will lose.     To be completely honest I think that cecnsorship is completely and absolutely wrong, especially in libraries. When someone is in their childhood all of the way into their adulthood, they go to the library if they want to find a book, magazine, movie, song or even sometimes a newspaper. Should their eyes be shielded from what others think are wrong, offensive, stupid or unethical? I think not, I think that the information is put out there for a reason and should have it's own voice."
1,"One someone told me this 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor Then you also have exactly same right and so does evryone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive?            We are all made different evryone have their likes and disslikes. Some like scarry movies or funny moves, maybe druma, and action. I like action movie I like the on that keep you gussing who and what. I would't like if someone removed my faverit type of movie or book from the shelf. Most parent want nothing bad for their kids so they keep tham away from the stuff that is not good for their mind.             @CAPS1 is a big place open for public to come and injoy the books  and magazines, or the movies and music. I been to the @CAPS1 befor my first time was amazing. I am not a big reader but there were so many choces. People go to the @CAPS1 to find information, injoy their favret authers and books. I one went to the @CAPS1 and asked for a book they said someone lost it that made me mad people dont dont take care of public proporty.            If someone doesnt like what they see on the shelf don't take it. But i thing the idea of having the books rated like they do the movies. @CAPS1 does a good job obout that they have A-@CAPS2 and saporated by different cotagorys. If you go to the @CAPS1 you usualy look for what you want not something you don't want. So if people take something they dont like of the shelf they must not like somone who is reading it or who writen it.           I believe that materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines that have offensive thing in tham it mite not be for some people. Like i said we all made different  we have our own like and disslikes. @CAPS1 is a big place that has something for evryone. If you don't like something dont take it. And having things labled would be a big helf for anyone that is looking for something they like."
1,I do not beleive libraries should be censcored from materials and works someone finds offensive the first reason i say this is some of the most classic and appreciated literary works for example such as catcher and the rye were highly contreversial in their time of publication the second reason is offense is based on the person views and opinions what @MONTH1 be downright offensive to one individual could a work of art to another which says that if libraries were censored would it be fair? if libraries were censored they would not be havens of learning and literary exellence anymore they would become a place for one persons views and opinions to influence another without any opposing views which instead of libraries being places of intelligence and learning would become the breeding ground for ignorance and then where would all of our unyet written literary classics come from the literary world would become monotonus and boring the literary world and the entire world by extension needs differing opinions for greatnes
1,"I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed."
1,"I believe libraries should have all types of books, music, movies, and magazines. I believe if libraries had limited things that alot of people would not come to the library. For example, if I wanted to get a certain book for school and the library does not have it i don't no were else I would go. The library should have a variety of books if not what if the point of a library. Some books might be to explicit for a child to read.      For music I think a library should be limited.I think music should be limited because alot of music has cursing in it. I don't think everyone wants to hear that type of music in a library. I dont think a person should be able to listen to music in the library anyways because a library is suppose to be quiet. But also people who listen to that type of music might be disappointed. Some music might be to bad for some chlidrens ears.     For movies I think they should have an age limited for children. Thats simple kids should be able to only watch kid movies. Teenagers should be aloud to watch kid movies and teen movies. Adults should be able to watch all movies. That is how it should go.     For magazines they should have all types of magazines. They should have them from child to adult but in different sections. For example, All the children magazines should go with the children books. All the adult magazines should be with the adult reading books. Some magzines are to explicit but the library should make sure the magazines stay in the adult section.      Some books are offensive but there books and a library is there to provide books. All kind of books should be in the library no matter what in my opinion. I've never experience a nasty, or explicit book. So if anything is explicit keep it in the adults only section. Every book should be in the library"
1,"No, I do not believe that certain material, such as books, music, movies ,magazines, and etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. Removing these items would cause much confusion and difficulty for a lot people. It wouldn't be fair to the adults, younger children should know which materials are appropriate and inappropriate for them, and a lot of stores would get less or run out of business.     A library is open to everybody of all ages, meaning adults, children, and elderly people. Younger children should know right from wrong and is wise enough to know which materials are appropriate for their age and which things are not. Libraries have different sections and usually if a minor is found in a section where he/she does not belong, an employee would tell them they are not suppose to be near that certain section. Adults know before they enter a library that there are items with censorship and they should keep their child by their side and make sure he/she does wander off into those adult sections.     Libraries have items that everyone of all ages enjoy and it really benefits everyone. So, it wouldn't be fair at all to adults to get rid of certain items that they enjoy. I know if someone was trying to take away materials that us teens like I would be very upset and libraries are a good hang out spot for young adults now days. Adults would feel very betrayed and hurt that things that that enjoy are being taken away from them and no one wants to feel they are treated unfairly.     I think that a library would get less business if these items were removed. Most of the business that a library does get is because of these items. If these items were taken elsewhere than they would have less business and they would be in competition with other stores. Some of these items are only available in book stores, such as magazines and many books. They would be very hard to find and we probably would have to order these items offline if they were take off the shelves. Adults spend a great amount of money on certain books, so taking them off the shelves wouldn't be a very good idea. It wouldn't be good for business.     I know you @MONTH1 think that censorship is a big problem, but it's really not. If you really put enough thought into it and knew how to eliminate censorship problems than it wouldn't be any problems. Everyone should be able to walk into a library and enjoy the materials that find interesting. Taking away these items would cause great confusion and difficulty so, you should really think twice before removing these items."
1,"Everyone has their own rights to do the things that interest them, right? The answer to that is yes, of course some people @MONTH1 not agree with what your interested in. For example; picking out a book at the library. So many choices like fiction, nonfiction, action, and many more. Some people enjoy reading about murders others might enjoy hearing about monsters, that's their own choice.          I believe everyone should have their own choice in what they want to read, listen, or watch. So why should libraries take things off the shelves? Something that you @MONTH1 find offensive might not be to someone else.          They shouldn't, just because there are offensive things on the shelves, doesn't mean you have to look at it or read about it. If the libraries were to remove everything that is found to be offensive, where would the people that are interested in those types of things be able to find it? They wouldn't, you'd be taking away the freedom that we have to read about the things we want, or to watch and even listen about the things that we want.     If there are things on the shelves you don't want your families to read about, then let them know where they can and can't check things out from. By keeping these things on the shelves everyone will have a choice in what they want at the library.     After reading why I believe things shouldn't be taken off library shelves, maybe many other people will be able to have a better outlook on the interest of other people"
1,"There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books.     If other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book. Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books. Certain people like certain types of books, maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it. If anything the reader might even like the book and check it out.     The books are there for entertainment. Thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though.      Books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one persons opinion. When  all they have to do is do not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers entertainment."
1,i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year           so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels     however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work     i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer     this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much
1,"I do believe that certain materials should be taken of the shelves if they are found offensive. I think children should only be able to read certain books cause, some books say things should know until they get older.Some books, music, movies , magazines should be removed if offensive. I think they shouldnt make some kids movies , books, music like that for little kids. They put to many things they should not  in kids movies.     The movie the @CAPS1 they should not let kids watch that movie its not a movie i would let my kids see until they was older.The reason why is cause it has alot of  bad language in it . It is about these guys who take ruphies. This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that i would let my kids watch.There are people getting drunk in the movie . they do stupied things.They try to make it look like its a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things. I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch.   Some music has to much bad language in it. I think they should make better songs for kids. Songs that really mean something or about someone. Most of these songs they sing now is about dumb things that do not mean anything.I think some magazines are okay to read but some just talk about actors. Like @PERSON1 I read one time about here doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it.   I believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things kids should be able to see them or read them. If they did that kids would not talk and do things like they do today.That  kids would not try to stell and things like they do in these movies they see it happen or there friends do it. So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but, it is not."
1,"The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere.     The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to.     The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of.     If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want.     Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This @MONTH1 be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to?     Although to some people this argument @MONTH1 go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world @MONTH1 come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want."
1,"Would you ever read a book about the @CAPS1 times if your @CAPS2? Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured? Probably not. If your a colored man/woman, are you going to engage in a book that talks about slavery? Not likely. How about if you are a mother, are you going to want to read a novel or magazine about abortion? Are you going to let your child read that book? Of course not! So you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves, right? Its on the shelves for basically one reason, to drownd us in the knowledge it holds.     Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there is always going to be one person who is against it all. When we read, we find books that are to our own enjoyment, we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads. Most of us however, don't quite understand why others refuse to read such a book or even hold in their hands a book that is different from all their beliefs. Beliefs are important to people no matter their age, gender, sexuality, or their race. Its just a way of life.     Some stories are there for our entertainment, some catch our emotions, and some our there for our knowledge. When authors write, they usually think of events that have happend or what they predict could happen in the future. Authors try to get you to understand the world around you, not by trying to offend you in anyway. Books tend to affect people in many ways, possitive and yes, sometimes negative. Its something they can't really control though, so you can't really blame anyone for you being offended.     I don't agree that libraries shouldn't have these books on their shelves, I think they are good for us. No, i don't mean we should go around eating books. We should take time to read some of those so called offensive books. You are probably thinking, there is no way I'm going to pick up that type of book and sit down and read it. However, let me tell you that if we read these books, the more people will understand about how terrible times were back then and how some things are still bad. Take abortion into perspective. Books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is or how it can not only effect the women who go through with it. It appeals to the emotions of others in a way that makes them think twice about lifes decisions.     Books should be kept on the shelves for our own well-being. When it comes down to the choice, you will know just what to do. You know how useful books are in helping us see the differece between right and wrong. You understand why books are placed on shelves for in the first place, no its not for the money. I know that you are going to understand what I'm trying to tell you. Now head on over to your library and pick up a book about something you would like to no more about. Who knows, maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings"
1,"Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work"
1,"In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do.     Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @MONTH1 be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible?      One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @MONTH1 be offensive to you.     Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left.      In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. So keeep the books on the shelves"
1,"So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks @CAPS4. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf.     I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.      What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library?      But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta @NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad.      After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to @CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's @CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when @CAPS4 comes to books.      That's when the question comes up, '@CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' @CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for @CAPS4? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms.     @CAPS4 sounds crazy, but @CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for @CAPS4, check @CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. @CAPS4 sounds easier that looking @CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number.      All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause @CAPS4 @MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, '@CAPS4's better to keep a book, than to forget a book."
1,"Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction.  No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should not be censored.     Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong.  I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life?  At least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like.  It is all a learning experience.      History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in @LOCATION1, the @CAPS1, and now the wars in the middle east.  Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @CAPS6, why and what happened.  Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it.      Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @NUM1.  If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @CAPS4 and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years.      I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker.  All that is doing is giving readers less material to read.  In @LOCATION2, elementary educators are not required to teach their students @CAPS6 to spell, at all. I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell @CAPS2 '@CAPS3' thinking that was the correct why to spell @CAPS2.  The @ORGANIZATION1's excuse for not having teachers teach @CAPS6 to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday.  Well guess what @LOCATION2, with the @CAPS4, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know @CAPS6 to read and this is what it is going to be like.      '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@CAPS6 should i know, I wasn't taught @CAPS6 to spell in @LOCATION2.'     You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our @ORGANIZATION1's future on @CAPS6 to spell simple words.        Today we have the @CAPS4, gaming systems, iPods and @CAPS8 to intertain us on a daily basis.  No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television.  And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read.  You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book.  To be truthfull I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle.  I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring.  When i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and @CAPS6 I interact with others.  I have learned @CAPS6 to deal with all of those things from books.  Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and I would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books"
1,"I do not think that a book should be removed from the shelves of a library if a few people think that the material is offensive.  A library is a public place where everyone has the right to read, listen to, and watch what they want.  If a child wants to read a book, the parent should be the one to decide if they can read it or not. Everyone should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what they want. They should not have that freedom taken away from them just because some people find it offensive.     Everything could be taken as offensive.  If every single book that had something offensive in it was taken off of the shelves at a library, there would be no books left to read.  Some people are offended by things that others are not offended by at all.  If someone has a problem with a book, song, movie, or magazine at a library, then they just should not read it. It is as simple as that. If a book was removed off of a shelf just because they found it offensive, that person could have just gotten someone else's favorite book removed.  If I could never read my favorite book again because it was removed off of the shelves, I would be devastated.  You can not complain about every little thing in life, you just have to move on.     There are sections at a library for a reason.  They have places for adult books, children books, teenage books, mystery, romance, humor, horror etc. Obviously some books are going to be more offensive than others. People have the right to know what kind of book they want to read before they start reading it. That is why they seperate everything into sections like that.     Offensive language and actions are a part of history.  Some of the best books ever written have offensive language in them.  If the language was censored, it would not make the book what it was. 'To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2', for example, it was written when offensive language was used in just about every sentence. That offensive language was how they talked back then, and if it was removed from the book, it would be like removing a piece of history.      Parents can not censor their children from everything.  Once a child hits the real world after being censored from everything offensive their entire life, they will not know what to do.  Everyone has to deal with a few harsh words or actions every now and then. That is how you learn to deal with them. If a parent does not want their child to read a certain book, they can censor them from reading it in their own home, it does not need to be removed off of the shelf just so that one child can not read it. In all reality, a child will do what they want to do even if they are not aloud to. Parents can try to stop them, but if a child wants to listen to a song that their parent does not like, they are going to find ways to listen to it anyway. I do not think that a parent should go out of his or her way to remove material from a library, because they are not helping anyone out by doing that. They are just going to anger people.     I can understand where some parents are coming from by trying to censor things in libraries. Most are just looking out for what is best for their child. They can not censor their child from everything forever, though. Children grow up into adults. Parents might as well let their child hear or see some offensive material while they are young because this world is full of offensive things and they are going to have to get use to all of it.     Books, songs, movies, and magazines that have offensive material in them should not be removed from the shelves at the library. Some people @MONTH1 enjoy reading, listening to, and watching those things. Everyone has the right to read, listen, and watch them if they want to. It should not depend on other people's opinion over the material. The book, song, movie, or magazine was made for a reason.  If the material was too offensive, it would not be placed on the shelves"
1,I find it intresting that people think that its there problem to go to the book self and say this and that shouldnt be aloud here. I also feel thats if you dont like the book dont look at it. Or read it. I mean I kind of understand about the magazines becouse somethimes there can be pretty bad. I mean at the same time its noones job to say what is right and what is wrong.                   The music I am @PERCENT1 with it being taken out of the libraries. some of the music people lisson to today is just not right or kids or adults. People are wanting to know why there is so much killing and hate in the world today. The movies at the libraries are pretty good they dont let thim get to bad i cant compain to much about that.        All around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it. Just some stuff that I would change but really what I think doesnt matter. Im only a @NUM1 year old kid i mean I can give my thoghts about it but thats about it. I love the libraries nothing will ever stop me from going. If I dont like something thin i just dont read it or look at it and thats how everyone should be
1,"I think that the offensive books and movies should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to people and that there should be no right for people to write those stories that might offend others.      The books I have read and movies I've watched could be offensive to others of a different race, religion, etc. I had never thought much about the books I've read being offensive to others, but in many cases they could be offensive in some way. Stories written in books or made in movies could make fun of or hurt people of a different race or of their religion and they should have the right to remove that book from the shelf if it is offensive to them. For example, a book that has a story about a certain race or religion of people all looking or acting exactly the same, which isn't true then those people could be offended by that story.       If people could be offended by books or movies then those books and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries. Some children who have taken offensive books and movies off of the shelves of libraries and have read the books or watched movies @MONTH1 not understand what they are reading or watching and they @MONTH1 not understand that some books could be offensive to others. I think those books and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries so that children don't read those books that could be offensive to them or others."
1,"We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want"
1,"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things."
1,"The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it.      Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it.        Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that.     There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate.   Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go."
1,"The offensive things found in a library. In many libraries now a days there are all kinds of vilent and bad books talking about vilenst. Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelfes find out.     The library should not have to take these tipes of things out of the library. If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them. For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library. You have to be over @NUM1 years of age. For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. If the parents dont like it then dont get it.     They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have. Kids under a surtain age should not be allowed to read the books. If they still want the book they have to get parents permissition to rent it.      Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library. You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and with an adult. If you want to rent a movie you need to have parents permissition. You also have to watch this movie with an adult.     Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. You can still rent it if your parents say its ok. They should make the @CAPS5 behind the counter. So that little kids can not see the front of the cases. If the parents dont like the libraries rules then dont rent anything from the library.     So dont take off the offensive books, movie, or @CAPS5. If you were head of the library what would you do. Take out the offensive things, or just put them in different sections"
1,"Libraries are wonderful places to seek out something that intrests you. Some visitors are very sensitive to what is placed at the library for others to view, and causes some corruption among the visitors. They @MONTH1 become offended by what is placed on the shelves, for everyone to decide their interests, which leads to them wanting to learn more about them. Everyone has their own opinion into what is offensive to them, or not. Even though, some @MONTH1 take offense to what is placed on the self, these materials shouldn't be removed, because of the select few who are taken offense of the certain materials.     Many of the materials are placed into different styles, genres, and age groups. Authors write in styles which showcases their skills for everyone to see. Different styles are created, for everyone to experience and discover their own interests. For instance, children love picture books. Picture books are a marvelous way for children to be entertained while being read to. These pictures also help tell the story. Therefore, children prefer picture books, rather than giant chapter books, from the adult section. @PERSON1 is a great example, for an author who is talented to write for children. His poems and pictures are a wonderful combination to enhance the reading of a young mind.     Another style of writing would be for young adults. This selection of the community, has a some-what developed mind. However, its still developing, still gaining insite. Authors choose to write about romances, adventure tales, and almost anything to grasp the teenager's mind. Grasping the teenager's mind, allows the author to tell a story along with teaching the reader an important life lesson. An example for this selection of people, would be any selection from @PERSON2, a young adult writer, who writes about how beauty comes from within, and how every girl should be treated like a princess, no matter what.     Then there's the adult minds. Adult minds are mostly already fully developed. They all have different opinions on which interests themselves, as a person. This should be taken into consideration, when the library decides to remove some of their selection. Authors should write in a more sophisticated way for this group of people. They are also very picky about what it is they are looking for, and what interests themselves as a person.      The removal of materials, which @MONTH1 be offensive to some people is not the brightest idea, for a library to do. Somethings are offensive to certain people, while it @MONTH1  not be offensive to another. Everyone has their own opinions, interests, likes, and dislikes. By removing these materials, which @MONTH1 cause offense, is a disgrace of the true value of intellect a certain indivial @MONTH1 possess.     Some things, @MONTH1 be needed for school, such as writing, project, and learning topics. These topics might interest the young mind, and they would like to learn more about this certain topic. Some older individuals @MONTH1 take some of the topics, their child or grandchild is learning, offensive but they should know that everyone has their own opinion.      Taking away certain materials, because of the offense of someone's own opinion is uncalled for. If all libraries removed anything that offended someone, they wouldn't have anything left to share with the community. Censorship is not needed in libraries. It is an awful way for them put into the position to descreat the idea that everyone has their own opinion on a certain topic.      With everyone possessing their own opinion, they can be very sensitive and take offense to the littlest of things. People are given the chance to learn something new, by visiting a library. If the library removed any material that slightly offended a single person, everyhthing would be terminated and no one would be able to learn something new. Censorship is not a necessity in a library. Any interest, opinion, topic are necessary for a mind to develop and think. They should be able to learn without anyone constantly telling them about what is offensive or not. Nothing should be removed from the libraries of the community, for a learning mind is a healthy mind. We need a place to learn more about a specific topic besides school. So please keep the materials in the library, for everyone to have an opportunity to learn something new or in more depth."
1,just put lots of books and let your children get a book  that hes   interest at it let him chose a book that he whants to learn about    it about what he whants to know about life .                               if he likes music let him expres his self in the music that hi likes    or that he likes to sing he well sing about what some day hapened to him o when got in love with a girl or sing about someone who died  in hes famili every one likes to expres ther self in the music.  if he likes to watch movies                    some people learn a lot of things watching movies they learn          experiences like if they watch a movie about drugs they well know abot the consecuences about what drugs do. i know a guy that ust to sale drugs and when i nourest that drugs were nmaking hem reach one day i was thinking to sale grugs so i can be reach but one day i was watching a mexican movie that is about drugs and when i was watchint it i saw to much people dieing and the gus who were saling drugs the police arest them they take them to jail they were gonna be there for like the rest of ther life . and that idea what i think a take it out of my mind thats why i thik that people can watch movoies about they whant to see or about they want to learn.
1,"Books, magazines, movies, and music are things a lot of people enjoy. They like to read or listen to things that interest them the most; it might be a romance novel or country music. Today in our world, there are a lot of words people don't like little kids hearing, such as in books or movies. I think movies, book, magazines, and music should be censored in libraries because they can be offensive to people, they can create harmful ideas, and they can show little kids things they aren't ready for.     When people get offended they tend to get very angry. They don't like reading or hearing things that offend them. Some people take it too far and get out of control, but there is a point were the censorship stops. If a person was to check out a book at the library to learn about slavery, and it offended them to a certain degree, it should be removed. Even though it is an emotionally hard topic to learn about there is a point where far is too far. The population of the world should be treated equally and when one culture is offended, the people need to try and eradicate that.    Some people enjoy reading about murders and mysterious crimes, but others are disgusted by it. A lot of books or movies go into great detail about a crime or murder. They show every step of the way on how that murder was done. Most parents wouldn't want their child knowing how to kill a person. That's when library's should put mature books, magazines, etc. in a certain section. If a person wanted to committ a crime, I guarantee there is a book or movie somewhere in this world that talks about that specific crime. Those books and movies generate harmful ideas to the people. They find out things they didn't even know was possible, and want to try it. Therefore, it could cause harm to them or the people around them.      Everybody knows that little kids like to touch and know everything that goes on around them. When libraries have magazines with inappropriate pictutres on the front, it's not good for children. The children might not be old enough to know certain things, and I don't think parents want their children seeing that. Also, in movies there are scenes that are inappropriate for little children. It's the parents job to make sure their children don't see it, but there is also a point where the movie directors have to stop it. The ratings on movies are changing everyday and sometimes the movie is worse than what the rating that was issued said. Overall it's not good for children to see things they shouldn't at their age.     As you can see censoring movies, books, magazines, and music would have a big impact on the society. People wouldn't get offened, children wouldn't see inappropriate things, and people wouldn't get harmful ideas. There is a point where censoring could be taken to far, but knowing that the libraries, movie stores, and music stores are doing it brings comfort to many people, especially parents"
1,"A library is a place for those of all ages to sink to a book to learn, to use their imagination, to go to a mysteist far off place. Libraries have always been for children, teens, adults, and everyone inbetween. Taking away some of the reading options for these library go-ers would be a horrible thing. Taking away a series of books because one religion finds it unjust, or emilinating books by a certain author just because some find the author's style or tone wrong for children to read. This is just plain wrong. For many the library is a place to be yourself, to pick out a book or magazine that is about something you really enjoy and curl up into a big comfy chair and lose yourself in a great book or magazine. Removing items from the library could change this of some people, these people many not be allowed to read their most beloved book at he library because some think that it is 'too offensive'. The library shelves should always contain books, movies, music, and magazines for everyone to enjoy, the young, the old, and the young at heart.     A library should contain every type of book or magazines from picture to complex stories, from love stories to thrilling murder novels, and every author from A to @CAPS1. A library should be allowed to contain music from screamo to classical. The shelves should be able to have movies from romantic comedy to documentaries.  To remove certain books, movies, music or magazines from the shelves because of the content, the author, the language, or the pictures are 'too offensive' is wrong to do. It is unfair for one group of people to declair that a book is too volguer to have in libraries, because everyone has a different opinion of what offensive. For example it would be unjust to remove items from the library because a group of moms think that their children shouldn't be able to read romatic books, or because a religious group think that it is wrong that the library has too much information about @CAPS2 and not enough about their religion. If parents don't like that books, movies, music, or magazines that their child is picking from a library then that parent should watch what their kid is pick out and not allow them that certain book or movie. Those parents should not rush to the front desk in a panic and demand that the library remove that content at once, because many people have different definitions of offensive.      Offensive in one persons mind might be that a 'bad word'  is used, another @MONTH1 think that is perfectly fine. Some @MONTH1 think that wizards and witches are offensive, while others might particularly enjoy those types of books. Some @MONTH1 believe that their religious book is the only one that should be used in the library, while others think their holy books is better suited for that type of library or community. Basically what I am saying is that offensive means a wide varitiy to different people, so there is no way that a few people should be allowed to determain what books, movies, magazines, or music are too 'offensive' to be on the shelves of libraries everywhere."
1,"No I don't believe that those certain materials should be removed. Sometimes its good to have those things on the shelf because most of those things are telling whats going on around the world and what some people are interested in.     Books are something to read and learn and also to refresh your mind depending on what you are reading. I read books that interest me such as horror, action, and poems. The thing I read could be different from what others read. Thats why it should be a variety of things on shelves because its always people that have a different taste of books.     Music is somthing everybody listen to. You have those who listen to rap, hip hop, r&b, rock, and also gossip. Thats why there are different radio sations for those who have different taste of music.      Magazines are facts and someones opinion that is about someone famous or someone that have alot attention drawn to them. Its also alot of news reporters that post pictures and get some news about them.     Thats why I say no because everybody does not read, watch, or listen to the samething. That why it should be a variety of things for everyone to enjoy what interest them"
1,"Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with a huge diversity. Fiction, @ORGANIZATION1, horror, fashion, sciencefiction, and many more categories of literature are made. There is something out there everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had an ill opinion of it?     Everyone has an opinion. It @MONTH1 be in favor of something or it @MONTH1 not be. I believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people it @MONTH1 be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it. Someone @MONTH1 enjoy a piece of work  another finds offensive. It is all a matter of opinion. The opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not.      If you walked into a libraray and the shelves were filled with books, but only books everyone had a good opinion about the shelves wouldn't seem very full. It is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public libraray. Censorship is understandble to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections. In these categoires and section people @MONTH1 look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not.      Libraries have rated @CAPS1 movies. Many people could consider rated @CAPS1 movies to be offensive, but many people could enjoy watching rated @CAPS1 movies. Who wins, the people who find then offensive or the people who enjoy them? It is a hard choice to make. I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them. The same goes for books, magazines, and music. If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it.     There are hundreds of different sytles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines. They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. They can not censor things just because some people find them offensive. Others @MONTH1 enjoy them. What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public lirbaray"
1,"Certain materials that people @MONTH1 consider as offensive like, music, movies, magazines, etc., some of them are good for adults and no for kids, maybe because there is violence or something that kids must not know. If we think in the fact that they have to be removed from the shelves, there will be no freedom for people who made them, so they will be restricted of doing certain things that they like. This kind of materials must be in certain kind of shelves, like in a @CAPS1, there is sections where you can find books, music, etc., and they are divided; for example, kids section, teenage section, and adults section. Some people is just concern about the fact that maybe their children will read it and learn the bad things that are found in that 'offensive' books, but parents must be very careful about what their children do, also a good teaching from the parents is a good way for the kids to know what are they doing, and they will know what they do in the future and if it is bad or not. Some materials are just bad, but some people still like it, maybe they feel identified with the thing that they are reading, listening, or watching. So a good thing that maybe is consider as offensive have to be classified by their rate, like the movies are rated"
1,"I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading. I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects. Though books this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is there culture and how they live.    What would happen if every book that was considered offinsive was actually removed for book shelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial. The eye-opening world of these books is amazing. The fact that I can read about other peoples life, and their everyday struggle is astounding to me. If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion, then our world would be a mess.     Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read. I want to read something that is going to grab my attention, and make me want to keep reading. I do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed."
1,"Every person in the world has different views than what you do.  People are going to disagree with each all the time and that is life.  One topic that many people disagree over is if certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and other things should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive.  Everyone can make their own decison in what they believe in and mine would be to not remove these materials from the shelves.     It is very common for people to get offended.  In my life, I mostly get offended by what people have to say to me most of the time.  People do not think of what they have to say before they say it and it ends up being hurtful to the other person and they become offended by it.  So can people be removed from the @LOCATION1 if they offend someone?  Of course they can't.  So why should books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials have to be removed?     Everyone is entitled to make their own decisions for themselves.  If someone is offended by a book, music, a movie, a magazine, or anything else then they just simply do not have to choose to be involved with that certain piece of material again.  They can let their family or friends know how it offended them, what the topic was over, and let them make the decision to be involved or not be involved with that piece of material themselves.     When it comes to picking a piece of material, adults can make the decision for themselves, but children can not.  Children need guidance in life.  So if a child would enter a library to get a book to read, a parent or adult needs to assist them.  Parents know what is best for their child.  If the parent believes in the topic and thinks that it is ok for their child to read it,  then it is ok.  If a parent disagrees with the topic, then they do not have to let their child be involved.     People do not believe in the same things as others.  One person might be offended by a song they heard, but another person @MONTH1 learn from it.  That is another reason why certain materials should stay on the shelves.       In my life, I have read many books about teen pregnancies.  That is what motivates me to stay away from becoming sexually involved.  There are many teenagers out there that have became sexually involved and have ended up with a child at a young age.  To them, a book about teen pregnancy might offend them becaus they know that they made the wrong choice.  To others, a book about teen pregnancy might help and guide them to make a good decision and not become sexually involved.  So why take a book off the shelve that might help someone?      Everyone has their own opinion about the removal of certain materials from the shelves if they are found offensive.  My opinion is not to remove them.  Just remember that people can not be removed from the @LOCATION1 if they have offended someone.  So why should certain materials?  There is a lesson to be learned from everything you have experienced in life, even if it offended you"
1,"Should certain books,movies,or magazines be removed from the book shelves?  In my opinion no they should @CAPS3 be.  The reason I say this is because; just because someone see's something the wrong way dosen't mean everyone else does.  If you have a problem with your child getting those type of things make sure they don't check them out at libraries.  In addition to that you can go to the library with them to see what type of things your child is interested in.  The reason I say this is because whats @CAPS3 good for your child @MONTH1 be good for someone else's child.  Instead of judging the material that you think your kids should @CAPS3 see you should take the time to understand what it is all about.  For example my father would @CAPS3 let me read or watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' books or movies, until one day my older cousin was @CAPS3 aware of this and bought me a series of his books @NUM1 and then my father took the timwe to see what it was about then he ended up likeing it and bought me the video game.  That is why you should expose your children to @CAPS3 all material but some material early.  I say this because no matter how many times you tell a child no they are still going to try to get hold of the books, movies, or magazines that you do @CAPS3 want them to see.  In  conclusion you keep those materials on the shelfs because your child can still get exposed to it in todays society."
1,"How often do you find a book or a magazine that you don't want children or someone to read?  I mean I find them everyday for example, how people use there language like swearing or even the tv show they watch. I also hear when im with my friends or in a crowd of people. You hear them everyday even if you don't want to, but you do.     I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period. Its a public places and no one wants to see anyone with those books in the librarey.  What would happen if a child got ahold of one and they were looking it and if gave them nightmares or if it deals with crimes, rap, or miss happens with something wrong.     Sometimes what children read, they will say it or they will do it. so if a child see it they @MONTH1 think its alright to do it or they might think its amazing or cool to do and they might do it. Also again, you hear it on a daily basic like swearing. Lets say your child hears or reads horable language and they might say it to you or some of your friends, and you wont know where they heared or who told them.     The movies even have something to do with it to, because it all the movies are together kids to adults movies. they should separet the movies or even get rid of the movies because the children could look at the case and see something scary or drug related, something that you dont want your children to or even hear to.     Even though you hear them daily, you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around.  They need to take those book that discribe anything about crime, drugs, or even movies. Thats why i think they should get rid of those books and movies off the shevles and get them away from children"
1,"Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never"
1,"A lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them. Some people think that kind of thing is funny, but to others it @MONTH1 bother them. Not only racial slurs can offend people, but profanity can make someone disappointed. Some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that. And I believe if it is offensive it should be taken off the shelf in a library and you should too.     The movies and music I think if it really offended somebody that they should have to either change the lyrics or get rid of it. They just should not offend somebody to be a good song or a really great movie. You can't not make something that is making fun of another race or a movie of killing them.          Going to like school libraries, for books I think it really depends on the age group. Like their should not be anything that would be offensive or profanity in the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS4. They are just not old enough or mature to be seeing or reading those things in books or magazines. So if a student comes home with a book the class is reading and the parent doesn't like the content they should have the right to say that they don't want their child reading it. And if was really bad be able to take it out of the school.     Even @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that have more mature students get offended sometimes from the books their reading in school. One in example is 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6'. Even though it is a really good book and a lot of @CAPS4 read it. A lot of @CAPS7 @CAPS8 might get offended by all the racial slurs about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. They just do not feel comfortable fellow students saying them and their teachers saying them. And the @CAPS4 or libraries just should not make students read books that they don't feel comfortable reading. Or the libraries having books like that.     Me in example, next year I'm going to have to read that book and I am just not going to like it. I'm half @CAPS7 @CAPS12 and I do not like people saying things like that. It is going to be a really akward moment for me. And I have some other friends that have read that book that didn't feel comfortable reading that book.     Their are even little kid books that parents want out of their childs school library. The most challenged book in school libraries is @CAPS13 @CAPS14. I know this because my librarian told me this one day. It is just a good book, but some parents don't want their kids reading about witchcraft and wizards. So they try to get them out of the library. And they should if the parents do't want their kids reading it.     I just think if their is a certain amount of people complaining about a movie or song that their should not even be a fight about it. They should just get rid of it. Same thing in a school, if their is students or parents that are complaining and their is a certain amount of them, the librarian should not even have a say in it or the school. They should just get rid of the book or magazine.     I believe that if it a book, song, movie , etc is offensive to a certain amount of people that it should just be taken care of by getting rid of it. Parents might not want their kids seeing, hearing, or reading that sort of stuff. And some people get offended by some books or movies. Or they just do't feel comfortable. I believe that things that are brought to the world for entertainment should also be able to get out of the world if people are offended by it."
1,"Many things such as books, music, magazines, ect., causes problem acts for children to act different, but i say that everything should stay in the library because there more things that causes acts than the things that are listed. Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines but most get their acts from something different.   Children gets most of their acts from the television that their viewing at home wich causes them to think if their parents doesn't care about what their watching than it's okay to view what ever.So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies. So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch what evers legal on television.   But to me in the the libraries it's up to whoms ever controling it should decide by ages. just like legal things only legal for adults. I say that it's only for adults because childern starts argument from what ever they see expecially when their around their friends. When children is around their friends they feel that it's cool to do what ever. And it's all coming from thing based on violence in the books that children reads more often. So to me I will say that it shouldnt be okay for what is being viewed."
1,"Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well.  For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books.          First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books.          Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.          However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.          Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view."
1,"I believe that censoring certain things would not be wise a thing to do. My reasonings behind this are such, that it is impossible to censor life so why attempt to do the imposssible. My second reasoning is that it is the duty and responsibility of the parent and or legal gaurdian of a child to choose what they should and should not read, listen to, or watch, not the public library and or people's. My final reason is that it is no one's right to take away the rights to allow someone to listen to something or watch something, it is their @CAPS1 given right and their constitutional right to choose what they want and have it their way.     The first reasoning behind not wanting to censor cultural items, such as books, music, movies,ect. is that censoring life is unreasonable and impossible and all of these items are apart of everyday life. Books and movies have always dabbled on the edge of risque. They have always expressed topics or ideas too outlandish and unreformed to certain individuals, but these pieces of visual and literary imagery are parts of our @CAPS2 culture. These items express the very individuality and rebelious nature our fine nation was founded upon. I recall various sitiuations inwhich movies and music have been edited of tweeked to make it so someone will not be offended. This tweeking and changing does not assist in the bringing about of a new and frontier world it merely puts the old and free and expressive world in the dark. By taking out the ideas and items seen as 'controversial' you take away greatly from the learning factor for various individuals, you strip them of some of the key items that lead to a successful and avid learning experience. One instance I can think of that is completly outlandish is individuals attempting to take 'under @CAPS1' from the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5. The very thought of censoring @CAPS1 from our  nation's @CAPS4 is an insult to the founders and all they stood for.     My second reason is that personal censorship for children is the responsibility and duty of the parent or legal gaurdian.So many times has censorship,for youth, fallen upon the shoulders of the everyday individual when infact it is not their issue to deal with. It is the parent's job to let their child know what would be acceptable and unacceptable for them to view, read, or listen to. Now adays there are numerous songs,movies,and books that can be construde as 'outlandish', but it is not the responsibility of the everyday person to have to take the very things that they enjoy out of their lives because certain types of culture are unsettling to individuals,such as children. If such items are so awful for adolescents to hear or be exposed to parents should not allow them to be around it. They should have tighter control over what their sons or daughters are being exposed to if they belive such things can be harmful to their children's up bringing.     My third, and final reasoning, is that whose right is it to take away another person's wants or certain things they enjoy. This country was founded upon a speficic set of guidelines allowing various things to be spoken,written, and showed. It would be an insult to the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 wishes for some individual to come in and take another persons rights away as though they are somehow better than they are. The documents this fine nation were founded on state that every man is created equal, that no one man has any leway over another. The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 set down these specific guidelines to ensure that no one would be higher in opinion or controlling strength than another. They did this to ensure the nation as a whole would ultimately prevail despite opposite opinions and opposing thoughts. I personally do not believe in censorship because it would tear apart this country's very foundations,and when you do tear a fine house's foundation the supporting beams and the rest of the house will follow. What I mean is that by crumpling the ideal that this country's @CAPS7 states would ultimatly lead to a host of other issues that would have people wanting other things changed and more change and change begetts change and more change and very soon we would look at this country and not be able to recognize the face that we saw.     In conclusion, I believe we should not censor the content in movies, music, or literature. My reasonings behind this are censoring life is unreasonable and impossible, it is the parent's of legal gaurdian's job to choose what their children are and arent exposed to, and itis no ones right to take other peoples wants from them. The ideas passed down by our @CAPS8 @CAPS9 designated freedon to write and say until our hearts content, censoring the literature, music, and movies that make up this fine country's cuture would be a great disrespect to them and their honor."
1,"I think there should be censorship in libraries for those who dont like, or are not comfortable with what is on the shelf. Someone shouldn't have a problem with goin or taking their children to the library.          A public library is visited by children of all age's, size's, and races. If i took my child or children to a public library i dont want to worry about wether or not my child reads or views something they shouldn't or dont like"
1,"I don't belive that certain materials, such as books, musics, movies, magazines should be removed from the librarises shelves if they are offensive. Because if people wont to read offensive books they can and if they don't wont to read offensive books they don't have too. All movies are not offensive but some. They still should be removed from libray shelves.      Some offensive movies teach people things like the movie @CAPS1 that was offensive to some people. But it teaches you about slavery. Magazines tell about the news sometimes the news be offensive but it tells you about whats going on in the wrold"
1,"Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve. People might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something. If the material is offensive to someone they can report it but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it. The people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away.     If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it. I might look at it to see what it says but I would not say anything about it. There are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else. So why get it removed from the shelve? I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but, if I did then I would not say anything. Now some people would say something but, what if you walked in a library looking for a book for your research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive? What would you do? Yes you could get on the internet but, it might not have what you are looking for exactly.     I have had a lot of research papers. There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research. I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up. When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything. I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late. Computers are good for looking up stuff, but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information, you go for the book not the computer.     I know there are materials that are offensive to people. I know people get mad at them but, it is not the librarys fault. They most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them. So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it."
1,"Censorship, according to @PERSON2's @CAPS1, is defined as 'the removel or substitution of certain words, phrases, or scenes.' In many movies, they sell the movie that is seen in theaters, but then you can see the 'unrated' version. The reason it is censored is because many people think that a specific word, phrase, or scene in it is considered inappropriate and do not want to see it. But movies are not the topic here, we are talking about books, which creates a whole new idea.     '@ORGANIZATION1' is known widely by people all over the world. It is an @CAPS2 classic, and is read by the majority of high schools in the @LOCATION1. Now, parents and teachers are wanting to dispose and censor this work of literary art because of a single word, nigger. Many people cringe at this word, they hear it and their eyes widen. It was a common word used to describe a black man during the @DATE1. Now considered a racist term, society has looked down upon the word, and has proclaimed it as profanity or a 'swear' word. But how is it used @DATE2?     If you go into downtown @LOCATION2, and travel around keeping an ear out to all sorts of conversation, many interesting topics will come up, as well as slang words used to refer to one another. You will hear 'homie,' 'brotha,' 'my boy,' and many others, and one most commonly used, 'nigger.' @CAPS3 not pronounced correctly (pronunciation is 'nigga'), nigger is a term now used by many black people as a friendly reference to a close friend of yours. From what started out as a racist and belittling term, has evolved into a casual way of calling someone your friend.     So if nigger is a nice thing to say, why censor? Because of the context in which it is used. The black men are not friends of the white man, they are slaves. Nigger was just another way of putting @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in their place as the lowest class in society at that time. So now that we are getting technical in the context in which it is used, we should censor it in the form that it is used in the book, right?      '@ORGANIZATION1' is a piece of @CAPS2 art. It is known internationally, and written by one of the most famous author of all time. In @DATE3, more copies of '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' were sold than the @CAPS7! And now, parents and teachers want to 'rewrite' it. That would completely ruin the realistic viewpoints and story that is behind it. Life back then was very different from @DATE2, so how are we supposed to understand @CAPS9, if the world keeps censoring it? We can't! There are certain things in this world that we cannot change, no matter how hard we want to. Everyone looks back on slavery and realizes what a terrible thing it was to do to all those @CAPS8. But how are we supposed to understand the mindset of that time and what went on when people are removing very important details about it? '@CAPS9 is bound to repeat itself to those who do not care to remember it.' quoted by @PERSON1 himself. If we do not learn all that went on in that time, we are destined to repeat it.     The word nigger is very offensive to others, but we cannot change what it did. People must realize what has happened cannot be changed and we must move on, learning from our fathers before us. Censorship does no good for society but cover our eyes. We cannot succeed in life if we grow up seeing that the world is peaceful and people do not hate each other and all will be well. That's not how the world is, no matter how unfortunate it is, people will hate, and people will discriminate. So show us now what mistakes were made in @CAPS9. Show us now the outcomes of actions previously committed. Show us now how we can become better people and fix the future. Show us now, and do not hide @CAPS9 from our eyes."
1,"I believe that it all depends on the type of library and the age group of most of the people that go to that library.  If it is in a high school then I think that the books do not need to be censored, but in a public library there should be a certain section with uncensored books and a childrens section with books that are appropriate for children.     Most children under the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 should not be reading books about sex or drugs and alcohol.  The libraries in middle schools and lower should not contain uncensored books.  I believe that after middle school though, most of the kids already know what drugs and alcohol are and how they are harmful to you, and the books don't influence them to do it.  I also think that most kids by that time have also learned about sex and the risks of it, and they have already made up their mind whether or not they are going to do it before marriage or not.  Books that have violence in them should not be in elementary schools, however i think that other library's should have them on their shelves, because they are entertaining and i don't believe that they influence any normal person to do anything violent.     It all comes down to the age group of people that will be using the library.  I think that if all book are censored in elementary school and maybe even middle school libraries then they are fine to have in any other library.  If people really think it is necessary to do so they could put an age restriction on certain books, and if you are not of that age or older then you cannot purchase or check out that book from a store or library"
1,"Censorship is very important today. Others will say otherwise. Some people think censoring things, such as music, is uncalled for. They believe they have a choice to listen to whatever they want to listen to. There is a reason censoring things is necessary.     Music is one of the things that get censored alot. Sometimes it is not necessary to censor some of the words in the songs. People should be allowed to make whatever song they want to make. The library does not have to support their music.      Movies gets censored alot also. Some scenes should be censored, but if it is rated @NUM1 and lower their really is not a reason to censor it. Movies rated @CAPS1 and above should not be in the library, unless their is a certain section for adults only.     Magazines really shouldn't be censored. There should not be any magazines with explicit images in the library. If someone under the age of sixteen finds a magazine with explicit things in it, they have the right to report it.      Censorship can be annoying. It is necessary sometimes, but there is a lot of things that does not need to be censored"
1,"When it comes to censorship, I do not think that libraries should be affected. A library is a place to go when you need a certain book, movie, magazine, etc. If these materials were removed from the library, where will the reader go to find his or her desired book?      I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from the shelves of a library. Your public library should be a place that you can depend on to have the book or material that interests you.  If someone were to find a certain material offensive, then they should alert the librarian and maybe the librarian can put it aside or atleast in a different location. Everyone has something that they are offended by, but removing a material that @MONTH1 be helpful to somebody, is not the answer.       So as you can tell, a library is not a place to contain censored materials. It is a place that you can go to for whatever material you @MONTH1 need, whether it be offensive to some, or not. Everyone has their own views or opinions on censorship, but I do not believe that offensive materials should be removed from the shelves of our libraries"
1,"Why remove books from librabries when they share the information from all different times of periods to help the world understand what actually went on?  Is it right to hide the facts from the world?  Some people think it is completely wrong for books that are offensive to them to be on the shelf, but it is reality.  They must understand what they are living in and when they look around, those books that seem offensive, is what is happeneing in the world today.  Taking books off of the library shelves that are too offensive to some people will leave our libraries empty.     When going into a library, there are hundreds upon hundreds of books on shelves.  They range from autobiographies to nonfictions to children's books and even to fiction books.  Almost every book in the library is going to be a little offensive to atleast one person in the world.  If libraries were to remove every book that did not show censorship to one person, our libraries would be empty.     Looking at everyone's perspective of censorship, it is understandable why they feel the way they do sometimes, but they have to realize it is reality.  There are books on war, killings, books with bad language, raising a child, and the list goes on and on.  Taking books away on wars will leave our world with multiple unanswered questions.  People @MONTH1 not like how everything went down in the war, but if it was not for the war, they would not be where they are today in society.  Books with bad language sometimes do go too far, but they want to get their point across.  There are books on how to raise your children and not every one is going to have the same standards and perspectives on raising children and that is why every person in the world is different.     There is a point where people have to open their eyes up and realize this world we are all living in, is not a perfect world like every one wants it to be.  People make mistakes.  Some people @MONTH1 even say things that are offensive to someone else.  Authors of books are going to keep writing books and they are not going to be everyone's first option.  They are going to come off a little offensive to some, but removing them from shelves just because they @MONTH1 seem offensive, is not right.  Books are written for people to understand the world, to understand people that got the world to where it is today, to go over and beyond with your imagination, and to basically just understand the way of life.  How can we take that away from the world? From the children?  The world needs to be told things and it @MONTH1 be going through books, magazines, movies, or even music, but it is all not going to be bright and beautiful.  There are going to be clowdy days.     People need to understand the way of life and to understand this world we are all living in, is by no means perfect.  Books are going to come off offensive.  Their is censorship in many books, but not all the books are going to be like that.  The facts have to be known.  Taking books off the sheleves that are too offensive to some people, will leave our libraries empty and our world with unanswered questions."
1,"If i had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library i wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because everybody as a right to read, lisen and see whatever they want. If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place. Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books beacuse it would affect their children.Their would be a change in kids education.     Everybody has the right to read whatever they want. Their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things. If books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out. One way or another evrybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lifes anyways.     The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it. In my opinion I think that if parents took the time to explains their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children.     Another reason of why i wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids. Removing books means taking away history from them. There are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive. I think they should never take that history from them beacuse they are just learning things about their history.     Books, music, magazines, ect should not be remove from libraries. Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not. Removing this items would just be a total chaos. They should leave the libraries just the way they are. Everybody has the right to read, lisen and see whatever they want."
1,"We have all read a book or heard a song that has offended us or just didn't catch our intrest, right? You just want to throw the book away or call the artist of the song and ask them what they was thinking! Then we have the books that we just absolutely love and want to keep rereading them all the time and the songs that we listen to everyday. The way you like something is all based on opinions and how you think.     Everyone is different. Even if its by skin color, religon, age, where you live. We are all different. Someone could like a book, magazine, or song that everyone else absoultely hates. Everybody could love a book, magazine, or song that one person absolutely hates. In the end everything is both hated and loved by someone.           Therefore if you could just remove something off the shelf or censor it so somebody is prohibited to explore it, it wouldn't be fair because there is somebody in this world that adores or would adore that. Your taking away privelages of everyone else, keeping them from wonderful stories and lyrics. Would you want someone to take away your favorite book or song? No, and neither would anyone else in this world.     I agree with Katherine Paterson, everthing would be gone in the end if we had the power to take something away that we didn't like. Nobody would have anything to read, listen to, or watch because we all can't agree on anything in this world."
1,"Brian @PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 @NUM2                                    Censorship in Libraries          Should there be censorship in Libraries? If this is a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library no, but if it is a @ORGANIZATION1 library, yes. I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines.          First I'm going to tell you about the books. I think the books in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty. Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say. I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a @CAPS2 @PERSON2 book, all that matter is that they are reading. War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be. Now in a @ORGANIZATION1 library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs. I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum.           Next  I'll talk about the movies they should have avalible in the library. I don't think anything over @NUM3 at a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level. Exept like sex ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, its got to be @NUM3. In @ORGANIZATION1 I it should be @CAPS3-@CAPS4 movies. In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films, so theres no reson for there to be anything worse than @CAPS3-@CAPS4.          Last I'm going to tell you about magazines. In @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I don't think the magazines are a big issue. Just as long as theres not @CAPS7 and stuff like that. At the @ORGANIZATION1 leave again I think they should be, kids that age shouldn't be reading @ORGANIZATION2. They just need to have learning and for fun magazines.          Should there be censorship in libraries? No at the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level and yes at the @ORGANIZATION1 level. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 leave the book shouldn't @ORGANIZATION1 they should, should in both @ORGANIZATION1 movies, and magazines shouldn't in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and should in @ORGANIZATION1."
1,"They should not remove things thta are offensive.Why remove it when as you grow up and get to explore life you will have to go through alot of offensive things.Kids need to learn things like this beacause it would help tech them what they might see in the future.You cant just hold things back music is a way of life sure there will be foul language in it but dont take it away because the kids parents use the same words.Movies they are for enjoying and for bringing people together the kids might see bad things but all you have to tell them is its not real.     That is like saying kids cant watch basketball games on t.v cause they are ruff or even football games,thats also like saying your kid cant play that sport they might get hurt.Well you will never know untill you let then do it.Good and bad things happen to everybody so dont take away ther enjoyment from most people casue thats what you think or other people think.     When i grow up and have kids i plan to let them make mistakes and learn from it and thats cause you have to do that in life.We all understand you are caring for the kids but that will not stop them from doing what they want kids will be kids, and some kids will try to act like adults so treat them like it.Im just saying pretty soon your kids will be adults and you cant always try to hide theem from the real world, you might try but it could lead to mental illness and other things.So just let the kids explore life cause you know what they say you cant always stay a kid forever."
1,"Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1'm writing your newspaper company this letter because @CAPS2 the same way Katherine Paterson feels, and we should not be able to have any of the following books @NUM2,and any sexual books. Because they can scar a kids mind forever, so in my opinion any books with thatstuff in the book should not be on the self for any public library. Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought.Also let me give you a example,lets say a little boy asks were the action books are, the libarien would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too. And in my opinion that is all I need to say.Sincerly your customer @PERSON2."
1,"'@CAPS1', the woman shreaked as she had just received a fierce, sharp,and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband. This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2. To think all of the innapropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well you are wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable. This is why books, and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2.     In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 we have magazines, in which case these magazines are very graphic. Kid's will read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kid's draw disrespectful things in them. As to think that wasn't ignorant enough they also rip them in half and do many other dismantling things to them. One of the reasons why I feel that the @CAPS2 has so much trouble with criminal people is kids feel these days that they are allowed to draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren't their property. Which allowes them to think they can do whatever they want. Kids read about crazy things that aren't necessaarily teaching you anything. Unless that is you want to learn about having a zombi apocalypse and zombies take over the @CAPS2. To have that in a school public library what is that teaching kid's? Absolutely nothing, but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things. These are all some valid points as to censor or take out some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries, or to possibly censor some of the cussing.     The last point I will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property. Also to mention all of the dirty pictures kid's draw in the magazines and books. Schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point. They would save a much needed amount of money if they didn't let those books leave the classroom or school library. Kid's wouldn't be able to draw in them or steal them or even damage them and all the money they could save and put it towards something learn fulfilling.     Well behaved children all around the @CAPS2 is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the @CAPS2 in libraries. If you dont let them be taken out of the library how could kids possibly damage or steal or even draw in them. By not allowing kid's do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kid's around the @CAPS2 know they need to show some respect. With all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling. If you could please take the information i have given you and think about it, it would be greatly appreciated"
1,"When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all. A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people. If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it. Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it comtains the information that they have been seeking.     When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's to bad. Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completly acceptable. Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case @MONTH1 be.      Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals. But my belief is that if your a good parent then shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff. If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such. For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it. Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show. It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material.     There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is @LOCATION1 and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe. People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people"
2,"The setting of the authors  shortcut effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well. Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills. The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill. The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said,  success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts. I believe that @PERSON2 agrees."
2,"Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for rough road ahead, @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging."
2,the setting is great for that tipe of story and that s how it should be.
2,"In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit the then features of the setting affects the cyclist. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it states, Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This basically says that there is nothing around him accept for road and he has a long way to go before he gets where he wants to be. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 it says, At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake this also means that his is in nothing but desert and there is nothing in the desert.  "
2,"Think that the cyclist is the meaning of the story. The features of the setting affects the cyclist because, the setting gives the reader their own ideas about what their reading, watching, hearing etc."
2,"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was going through a very dry deserted area. At first he was fine until he started to run out of water, and twenty miles up the road I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt holld in the lamest mule greeted me two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. If he were in the city where he could get water anywhere he would be fine, but he is in the middle of a desert, with nothing for miles. This was like a time when my family went hiking for three days. When we had come to the last part of the trip, my dad looked at the map and thought the fork in the road, the left, led to a shortcut. Well as we found out it didnt, but only led to us having to walk through a bunch of thorny bushes that scratched us all up. Its not always easy to take the shortcut, and just go the way you know."
2,"In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. "
2,"The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am Im surprised he lived and that he was that lucky."
2," The Features oF the setting affect the cyclist Because There challges he has To meet. Pike when he came To realize maybe The old peoples way wasnt The greatest when he saw.

2,"Some o f the features of the setting that affect the character are the heat and lack of water. The heat is making him feel more tired and is making him fatigue easier. You can tell that the place he is in is hot because it says that is in a @CAPS1 desert and it is the summer time. The lack of water causes the character to fear dehydration and that causes him to waste alot of time looking for water. For example, when the character stopped and pumped water for two minutes, he could have been on his way to Yosemite. A third feature of the setting that affects him is the hills. This affects him by slowing him down and delaying him futher."
2,the features of the setting effects the cyclest because the setting was a desert with no food or water. He listned to A old man who said go the shortcut way but the shortcut way went over hills for about @NUM1 miles.   
2,The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The hills make it very difficult  for him to pedal. The grape juice factory has very dissapointing to the cyclist. The snake made him very uneasy. The features of the made the ride very difficult.
2,"The features of the setting really effected the cyclist in a harsh way. An example of this is the hot air, and lack of water. The cyclist was so hot and so thirsty while riding to his destination. The hot air and lack of water caused him to slow down and made his bike ride a battle of survival."
2,"The features in the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. Even though the cyclist didnt show a sign of giving up on the tough hills, snakes, bad road condition, and most of all lack of water, the cyclist still showed confidence and determination. Without the obstacles in the cyclists way, there wouldnt be need for hard, concrete determination to move on"
2,"There seemed to be a few problems for the cyclist and the setting. One problem is he was riding in the open sun in California, in the middle of June. This is a problem because sometimes the weather gets so hot that people die of heatstroke. Another problem that the cyclist encounter is the terrain. In the story he says it goes from flat, desert terrain to rolling hills. Its obviously much eaiser to ride a bike over flat terrain than up hills, so these conditions affected the cyclist. Another problem for the cyclist and the setting would be the fact that all of the towns that the cyclist kept arriving at ghost towns. This was a problem because the cyclist had very little water left after a while. These problems, chart among them lack of water must have been devastating for the cyclist because he writes about how bad his shortcut was."
2,The setting affects the rider because it is very hot wich makes him thirsty. how long the road witch affect his mind state and last the fact that ??? is in sight and that affect is coral
2,"In Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The lack of life affects the cyclist because he cannot stop and talk to anyone or ask for help. There are no buildings, or cars, or people anywhere. Also, the lack of water affects the cyclist. Since there are no buildings, there isnt going to be any water. If you dont have water then you wont have enough energy to keep going. The cyclist also needs water because he is in the desert and temperature makes him really thirsty."
2,"The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake  it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, I hung my head. The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
2,The feature of the setting cast a dark cloud of bout on the cyclist. The extreme temperature drains all his energy out of him. Te lack of water takes everything else away.
2,"This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage."
2,Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said I wipe the sweat from my eyes.
2,"In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along  his ride he meets some old but confident men. They tell him a new rout wich was to slice away hours from his ride the setting was excedingly hot @DATE1. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way the first was a baren ghost town the next had water the flavor of battery acid, then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a baite shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns & dont let old timers try and change your mind."
2,"The heat of the path, and the lack of places to stop for water left the cyclist dehydrated and fatigued. He said that at first the sun wasnt bothering him, but once he had drunk most of his water and his body couldnt cool off, the sun began to take affect, tiring him and causing him to sweat out most of his bodys water. Eventually he became so desperate he had to suck on a small rock. While the story doesnt say it, this did seem to help him untill he got to the bait store."
2,You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didnt have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing."
2,"Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. "
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in what he will need to do to stay safe. Forexample in the story Rough Road @CAPS1: Do not Exceed posted speed limit it says ,I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, roling hills. This the cyclist now knows that he will have to take it slower and try to getover the hills without getting hort."
2,"The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads."
2,"It is hard for cycleis because they have to go through a lot of riding bikes. sometime with out even geting a drink each mile seeing dealy anmials left and right, sometimes they lose there wind and have to stop for a amount of time so they will not past out on the hot steamy road. They be going for at least @NUM1 miles and some times more so bikers be doing a lot of stuff during there race."
2,"The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, add to the difficulty of his trip. For example, the author writes by the looks of it- had been a @ORGANIZATION1 factorya picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice This quote described the building he saw that he thought he could get help at. The picture he saw of the boy was almost teasing him. He desperately needed water, but he could not find it. Also in the story, the author writes A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. At this point in the journey, he needs water and he feels like he is never going to find it. He feels like his journey will never end. Lastly the author says I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, Id be fine. He almost couldnt take the heat or hills or dehydration at this point and almost collapsed right there. As you can see, the setting of the story played a big role in the difficulty of his trip."
2,"The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to  short, rolling hills, which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser"
2,Some of the feature of this story were that the person telling the story advised as not to take advice from old men who hadnt left their porches for years. Then the man telling the story proceeds to tell us the struggle he had from going from place to place looking for water he didnt really find it until the end of the story where he find a fishing shop and drinks from the sink. The moral of this story is to never take advice from old people that have been sitting on their porches for years without leaving.
2,The setting in the essay dramaticly influenced the cyclist and his actions. One feature of the setting that caused him trouble were the large hills. Also his ever preasant need for water was worsened by the hot environment.
2,"It is obvious that the features of the setting will very easily affect someone. In the passage Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In paragraph one, the speaker is describing how there were old men sitting on their porches which should have told him they werent the most updated people ever. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. This quote is showing how the setting of old men on porches affects the speaker to doubt the directions of the men. On his bike ride, the cyclist approaches a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. In this quote, the cyclist is troubled by the old features of this setting and it worries him because it appears no one has been to this spot in ages. This makes the cyclist very doubtful that he is where he is supposed to be. Overall, the cyclist is easily affected by the features of the settings around him and bases his attitude of his journey on them. These are just a few examples of places in the passage where the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
2,"The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.  "
2,"Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if its a sad story and its a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. Thats how the setting makes it better."
2,"The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills dont help any eigther."
2,The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the fact that the sun was beating down on him and he was running out of water. Another effect on the cyclist was that he was hot and began losing energy.
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid, that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."
2,"The setting in the story Do not exceed posted speed limit affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how hes going to die. He shows that hes lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from old-timers who havent left their porches since Carter was in office. In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving."
2,The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June. The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2,"In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he cant exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesnt ask for directions. So the lession is dont take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. "
2,"The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."
2,The setting cyclist by first givin the wrong directions. Also the cyclist had gone a long time without water. The sun makes it even more difficult for the cyclist. But the cyclist dont give up.
2,"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclists most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp. In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!  "
2,"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many different ways. One of the features was the terrain. ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.  This really affected him because he was already worn out from the first part of his journey, So hills would just make it worse. Another feature that greatly affected the cyclist was the heat of the desert. I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This proves that it was scorching hot and easier for him to dehydrate and pass-out. The last element of the setting that affected him was the animals. a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. This shows how the snake has a big threat if it would have bitten him. That is how the setting affected the cyclist along his long journey"
2,"I the story the fechers skair the cyclist. The fechers in the setting were   There was no one in sight, not as buildings, car, or structure of any kind.  He is skaired because he is realy thirsty and ther is no one around."
2,In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips. he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond backbloked the majority of the pavement. It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.
2,The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.
2,"The cyclist in the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit is greatly affected by the setting. In this case the setting changed the cyclists mood throughout the essay. Towards the beginning of the essay, the mood of the cyclist is humorous. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town I chuckled. The setting of the  ghost town made the cyclist chuckle, which made his mood become amusing. In the essay the cyclist describes a new setting, At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path. The tumbleweeds affected the cyclists mood imensly. The reader can tell that he is tired and loosing hope by this point and the tumbleweeds suggest this. However, this hope is quickly restored when the cyclist notices a building. Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view. When the setting changed from nothing to a building, the cyclists mood changes from hopless to hopeful. Clearly, the setting affects the cyclists mood."
2,"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. a large highway sign jumped out atm. Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit. sometimes life can feel so cruel. The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat."
2,"The setting effected the cyclist because of the heat. His lack of water made him lose energy and start to dehydrate. The extreme heat only worsened his situation. I was traveling through the highest deserts of California in June, as it says on page @NUM1. As well as the heat, the hilly roads only made him work harder."
2,"In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It sas that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the directions are out of date. The reason think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the continues of their porches since carter was in office."" The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride upand down through what he though of as it, rough terrain. That is what I think affected the cyclist."
2,"In the short story Do not exceed posted speed limit, the setting really affected the cyclist because since it was so hot he was dehydrated and didnt  think he was even going to make it to see tomorrow. As he was on his way to try to make it to Yosemite National Park he came across a lot of unfortanit events ariving to the first stop he clearly could see something was wrong when he was supposed to be in a town"" and he arrived at a ""ghost town. Moving on his water supply was running out and he felt as if it were @NUM1 degrees in the middle of June. As he was having a hard enough time he comes across a diamondback snake, but avoids it. Just when he thought there wasnt any hope for him at all he saw a camp ahead sign. As he rushed he got there and got water was okay. Now he is aware not to trust men who dont know what they are talking about."
2,"While the setting kept changing as the cyclist travels he approaches different hardships of his eviorment like when he had to find water because of all the times his supply ran short. For example one perdiciment where he found water it tasted like rust. The path the snake blocked off was another one, that he made it through alright."
2,The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the authour was not and augsosted and as she was ridding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle.
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. ... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist."
2,The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.
2,The features of the setting affected the cyclist by slowing down because of the damage of the road. Also the setting affected him by crossing a path of a ridiculously large snake . The cycler was at thirst although the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. This is how the setting affected the cycler in many ways.
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist  greatly. The features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think All hope is lost. The essay says this Over one long crippling hill, a bulding came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune ""summertime rattle around."" Then to a happy mo In an ironic twist that should please all sadist reading this, the building [...] by the looks  afit had been a welchs  grape Juice factory and bottling plant [...] I hung my head that smoky bluees tune sumertime rattle around. Then to a happy mood it states As I stumbled into a ra ther modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, i had a overwhelming  urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.""  "
2,"Jagged rocks, steep mountains, windy roads- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the jagged rocks made it hard to ride your bike. For example, if a rock got stuck in your tired you would not be able to pedal anymore. In addition, the steep mountains made it nearly impossible to bike all the way to the top. You would need to stop and walk your bike up the mountain; using more energy. Also, the windy roads made it hard to maunver your bike. Lastly, the heat made you sweat more which made the cyclist dehydrated. Jagged rocks, steep mountains, windy roads- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist."
2,"The features in the setting of this story have several different effects on the cyclist. The effect I think has the most on the cyclist is depleting her determination. In the story it says that Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. @CAPS1 your biking and the terrain changes the hills it make the going alot harder and makes you want to give up. The text also says There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. When there is nothing in sight it makes you feel alone and that your nowhere close to getting out of where you are and this feeling makes your determination to keep going deplete very fast. The last thing that the text says that would deplete a persons determination is the word sandblast.If your in a place that can sandblast a wall it makes you want to lie down and give up. All three of these examples from the text would deplete anyones determination pretty quickly along with many other things."
2,"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. Thats so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him."
2,"The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions"
2,"In this story. the main theme is how overcome year surroundings. His first sign of trouble is when he runs into some locals who are old and sitting on their porch. They see his map and proceed to give him directions, and me, thinking they know the area, decides to take their advice. He is fine untill he runs into a first town that is desputed. They have no water, but pay no attention and continues, @CAPS1 his journey, he sees a snake while going over the hills. Its his thinking grows he thinks he will not survives. The setting is what turns the little misunderstanding into something bad,the area is hot and empty, with no way of calling for help.And then, when he finds his heavin in a small @PERSON1 bait  shop, he gives the reader the suggsetion to ""never accept travel advice from a collection of timers."" In life you can face this problem too. I f you are writing an essay, and your parenst come along and look at it and tell you its wrong, remember this times have changed and you are the one taking the class, not them.So follow your get instinct.  "
2,"The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration."
2,"There are different features that can affect a cyclist during his journey. One of them can be lack of water, because it maintains your body and gives you energy to continue your route. Another affect can be the condition of the road because sometimes it is dangerous because of the speed in which the car is travelling. You can prevent them by taking advice from other cyclists and taking all the necessary things for your journey."
2,There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 
2,"In the story Do not exceed posted speed limit""  the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there many things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"". Because he did what to get lost. When he had to and other towns. The next example is when he came to a rock in the road:  And had to get water form a old rusted pump because he had really no water left in his water bottle"
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because he wasnt prepared for the long journey. One of the features was the rolling hills and this affected the cyclist by he had to use alot of energy, which he didnt have to pedal up and down the hills. He didnt have a lot of energy because he had barely any water to dehydrate himself. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the old water pump. The cyclist needed water and the water that came from the pump was hot and was brackish color. He said the water had, ''the flavor of battery acid'' to it. so, he couldnt drink that water. The final feature that affeced the cyclist was the bait shop that he came across, He went staight to the bathroom and, ''drank deeply from the sink.'' This affected the cyclist by it allowed him to become rehydratedagain for the journey ahead. In conclusion, the features of the setting posed great obstacles for the cyclist that he was able to overcome.     "
2,"How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is  I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is. I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.  "
2,"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."
2,To me it affects the cyclist because it is really hot outside. One reasson why is because it is only him out there he only has a little bit of water. He will dehydrate if he doesnt get more. There is no building or anything around him if he passes out what then no one can help him.
2,"Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is traveling through the high deserts of California in June , and this is making him really thirsty. [He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isnt a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilbers fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conlusio, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways."
2,"The setting affected the cyclist, because he didnt know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry."
2,"The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldnt bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,"
2,"While the biker is last the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist took a shortcut that got him lost and almost lose all his water. He learned to not trust advice from old-timers, but was saved so by finding by Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp.-owned by an old guy. During the cyclistss ride he saw a sign that said. ""Rough road ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit."" the cyclist was only going @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM2. Not having any water made him not go as fast, so the sign seemed to made him. Just as things were bad enough, it seemed that the sign was laughing at him. Then Joe kurmaskie writes, At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority at the pavement in front of me. The tumbleweed showed how how the short cutt was obviously not a short cutt and was taking a very long time. Tumbleweeds represent rolling through and through without a purpose, and that was exactly what the cyclist was doing.  The snake showed him how much danger he was in. He was lost and only had a few drops of water; he could die. The snake represents death and wicked by scaring people of being bit and dying. Seeing the snake raise the cyclists alarm and realization that he could die."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, it didnt really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears. This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much. One such feature is the heat. The cyclist thinks that I could drop dead from heatstroke obviously the heat is having an effect on him. Another feature is the @CAPS1 factory. This lowers his moral and makes continuing harder to do. Lastly, the rolling hills are affecting the cyclist. When he describes one hill he says it is a long, crippling hill, this is not a very fun hill to ride over. As you can see the setting the cyclist rides through hinders his trip a lot."
2,"The various conditions of the outdoors affect cyclists. When it is hot outside the cyclist consumes more water than if it were a fall afternoon, not too hot but not too cold. In this story the weather is horribly hot and the cyclist consumes a lot more water. For example the cyclist says, The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. This is saying that the heat has caused him to drink all his water and he doesnt have much left. Therefore the conditions of the outdoors affects cyclists."
2,"The setting is very effective aganst the cyclist in the story Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie. First he is put down when the first town is a ghost town and then he is is overjoyed when he sees the building in the distance but because disappointing when he got close the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it I hung my head. (Joe). If I was in that situation I would have been screaming and yelling. So this shows that the cyclist is very much effected by the settings features."
2,"The cyclist in the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again."
2,"In the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected doth emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. [The] sight was troubling,(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he finds an old fishermans store, he is relieved seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because, he could finally have a drink. The author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting."
2,The affect of a cyclist is a person who ride @CAPS1 all the time and they do it for a sport thats this hobbies they goes marathons and compete against other people around the world.
2,"In the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting effect, the cyclist. First, he was going a great distance. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town. If only the first town was @NUM1 miles, then the trip would be a long while. Also, he had a limited water supply and very hot weather. checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down. This is a major effect, because if he ran out of water, the sun would cook him. Finally, their was the change of roads to hills Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills This would cause him to put forth more effort to peddle, and make him waste energy."
2,"The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so thats how the setting affected him."
2,"The features that affected him was the location. There was nothing but a desert. He would go down roads with nothing there. He didnt have a lot of water, so he was limited. When he asked for directions they were from older guys and not much help. Thats some things that affected him."
2,"In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, a man struggles with his lack of water on a long bike ride. The destination is Yosemite national park, but to get there was quite a challenge. He had to go through long roads while the sun was beginning to beat down. He was taking cuts through high deserts of California in June. This was making it very tough for him. He couldnt find a good source of water, and to make matters worse, the flat road replaced by short rolling hills, was in his way. The lack of water going through deserts and hot towns made this ride tougher than the cyclist had anticipated."
2,"The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that dont remember the saying dont take candy from strangers. So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and its wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that the old man hasnt been off his porch since Carter was in office, so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude."
2,"In the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said I could drop from heat stroke, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasnt thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist."
2,"Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes hes experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old codgers  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel. Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        "
2,"At the beginning of the story, the cyclist was confident as he left the reservoir campground where he had been staying. When he arrived at the first  town on his stop, he say that the ""town"" wasnt abandoned, but down, and not really much of a town at all. The author said it looked like a ghost town. This was amusing to the author, because the old co of gerd he had been talking to had directed him to a ghost town. However, a short while later, when the cyclist saw the ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule, he began to feel troubled. The jiont of this second kud slow destination made the cyclist feel mad over as well. And when the water pump gave him a tarlike oozing substance, instead of water, he began to feel worse. When the terrain changes after this from a flat road to short rolling hills, the cyclist feels more down, trodde now that the terrain had become more rough. The cyclist says , sometimes life can feel so cruel, when he sees the Rough Road Ahead warning. Overall, the letting of the cyclist this is seen in fluential on his mood."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because how things looked and how the cyclist is started to feel. First before his travel he get travel advice from a collection of old timers. This good have threw the cyclist off because he @MONTH1 have thought them old timers didnt no what they were talking about. As he went on with his trip and decided to follow by their information he then begin to run out of water, when he did finally reach water it had the flavor of battery acid. The roads in the setting, also begin to be a problem because they kept changing appearance. All of this caused the setting to look like it was very bad and was not recommended for anyone else."
2,"In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesnt know."
2,"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the ??.???? the what he steal inside that ""I reached myself riht then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not  ?? the sight and felt he walking not make, fall on the ?? and get dust stick. Did he ??? want to happen gian so be ?? to always look at the map.     "
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, it says, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. This causes there to be many hills for the cyclist to go up and down. He gets tired more as he goes on the hills. I know this because it says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill, @CAPS1 the cyclist sees an old building which had been the @ORGANIZATION1 and all over sudden he becomes very thirsty. Lastly, was a stone that the cyclist found and he put it in his mouth so maybe it would help him not to be so thirsty."
2,"I think that the hills are the main problem . I think it was causing him to lack because it was winding and turning and it was causing him to go faster and when someone goes fast it makes than  loose  consontrastion, I believe that he was speeding and he was consontrasting  hard not to lose his balance and he was in a dessert or it looks like he was in a dessert, that what made me think that he would lose the lack of consontrations."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, the directions that he took from old people was out of date, because, the roads change, and the old people dont go exploring. Because the man took directions from the old people, he ended up taking even longer than what would have been the normal route, suffered from dehydration, and never made it."
2,"Heat, hills and ghost towns  all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on."
3,He put this at the end of the story  to show that saeng will not give up on what he loves and will continue to remember her home . The  hibiscus flower to her is like  a humble for her family back home and how she want give up hope . The flower keep her going everyday all needs is memories.
3,Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. Thats why the author concluded the story that way.
3,I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.
3,"The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 the author wants to show Saeng hasnt given up. Easly in the story Saeng goes to the green house and starts to cry. When she gets home she says to her mother, I-I failed the test. @CAPS1 of this Saeng wanted to go back and try again. That is why the author ended with that paragraph."
3,"The author concludes the story with this passage to relate the budding of the hibiscus with her own life, when she will have the strength to move on from her past, and find happiness.  In her new her life. In the story, the narrator is brought to tears in remembrance of her home town, and the beauty that it hold. She notices how the hibiscus is fake, which metophonically relates to how she feels her new home compared to her old. Its  its not a real one, Saeng mumbled.I mean, not like the kind we had at- at ... Its not the kind we had before. Saeng cannot yet face the pain that the hibiscus here bring to her. The pain of her past. They remind her of how she feels her new life relates to her old. One is not as beautiful as the other. Yet Saeng knows that when they are in bloom, she can appreciate their beauty while appreciating her new life as much as she does her old one. The author concludes with this statement to represent the hope that Saeng has to move on from her past and appreciate the present"
3,"I think it  was  a  good  enough  by Minfong Ho.Through out the story you feel somewhat happy,and somewhat sad,but always calm.You  feel happy when they are talking about all the  plants and when   her mother accepts the plants when she bought. At first, when you think  the mom is  going to yell at   her for buying that,after she failed her test.You feel bad for her but still calm mood and show the girl want give up,but just take her time."
3,"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story Winter Hibiscus, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, .. in the spring... its the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. Its letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  "
3,"In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her drivers test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes theyll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her. "
3,The author decides to conclude the story with this ending because Saeng is making an effort to succeed at something in her new country but she is giving herself time to adjust more to new surroundings and circumstances Saeng is not quite used to the new country and misses her homeland and she needs to take time to adjust.
3,"The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saengs mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saengs mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives."
3,"The last paragraph of the story Winter Hibiscus reads When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify a fresh start. Throughout the story saeng reminisces about her homeland of Vietnam. She weeps at how she has only memories left, and how things she held dear were irretrievably, irrevocably gone. As those memories linger in her mind, she realized that many things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar now. @CAPS1 the hibiscus provided her with sentimental memories, but now she can accept that @LOCATION2 is her new home."
3,"The author ends the story with a thought that Saeng vows to herself. The story ends with this paragraph to show her dedication. Saeng wants to take the test again. Saeng promises herself that in the spring she will retake the test. Ending the story with her thought leaves a powerful impact. It is now evident that she is dedicated to try again. The test is very important to her and she was very upset that she had failed it. Saeng is very dedicated to her family and to her plants. Falling the test deeply hurt her, but she is determined to try again."
3,"In the story, Winter Hibiscus, by Minfong Ho, the authors final paragraph shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author uses symbolism when, he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test. The author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of Winter Hibiscus means and this is why the author concluded it this way."
3,"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral. The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why and the geese return. is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you plant yourself you can thrive with confidence. "
3,"Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test."
3,She will try gardning again after the geese and flowers return. She wants to have the best garden around. She wants to keep the tradition going.
3,The author concludes the story like that because he or she wants to show the Saeng is committed to test even if she has to try again. It also showed that she loved what so might had wanted to try once more. It could be also that when the flower grows again and the geese come back. Thats might what keep her focus
3,"Many authors end sentences to show a feeling. Like some will leave you like a clirfhang and you have to imagine what happened or leave you wanting more. The story Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. To show that she is determined to move forward. The story is about a girl that used to live in a tropical place but had to move wl her mom. She shows how she slowly adapts the the new environment her own way. The author concludes the story this way by showing that next time she will do better. Saeng doesnt approve of way of living I much preferred it [bitter melon common to her homeland] to a Big Mac. In conclusion Saeng doesnt like her new surroundings but vowels to adapt."
3,"This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her drivers test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return... At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story."
3,I believe that the author concludes the story with those words because it is saying that whe Saeng feels ready and not discouraged anymore then she will take the test another time. She will be happy and ready for the test. The author also probably concluded the story with that paragraph because that is how everything else is started no matter what it is.
3,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldnt help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, I-I failed the test. When she says the test she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."
3,The author concludes the story with this because basically saying that when time change and the season blossom into spring then she will try again on the test. She wanted time to care herself before trying that test again.
3,I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.
3,The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature. 
3,"The author chooses to end the story with the paragraph because it is a happy and hopeful ending. The main reason that Saeng is upset is because she failed the test. However, she is also upset that she isnt in Vietnam anymore. It is also winter, which makes the setting seem as black as Saeng feels. The paragraph talks about spring coming again, which will melt away the black winter. The hibiscus will bloom, making Saengs surroundings more like home, and then when everything else is getting better she will try to pass the test again. She feels positive because she knows that everything bad will get better. Hope Is one effective way to end a story."
3,"The author closes the story with a positive mood. saeng has high hopes and is optimistic about taking the test in The spring. The author gives the main character a very important trait shown by that statement. The  story had somewhat of a remorse gloomy tone. It was important to finish on a good note. Several times saeng remembers her old life and begins to break down. But the author showed the audience how strong saeng is by overcoming difficult times much like the winter plant. The plant is a symbol  because it goes through harsh times in winter and is able to pull throught to bloom in spring. I believe saeng  chose to retake the test in spring because the plant had difficult winter, like she has,but will bloom in spring. She will plan to take and pass the test then. The   test suggest that the two are related and will overcome many obstacles."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to symbolize moving on and adjusting to a new situation. I know this because this statement refers to ports of a situation fitting together, much like geese fit in with winter. Also, the author says, Many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" @CAPS1 on this quote and how Saeng adjusts to her new situation, the concluding paragraphs states that she will take the test again in the spring, when everything is familiar to her.    "
3,"The author uses a touching ending to her story that snows the strength that saeng has to overcome her obstacles. It tells raeders  that as nature and hibiscus plantshe planted start to get stronger again ,she will to . The authors reason for ending her story with a deep thought might inspire others to overcome challenges ,just like saeng plans to. She wants to send the message of being strong out to readers .she uses the symbolism of the hibiscus to try to go deeper. When the author writes,hibiscus is budding  she is also talking about the memories  saeng has and how she will be able to overcome them and become strong at the same time that the hibiscus becomes strong . The memories of Vietnam lie in the plant and she knows that it will be hard to accept and adapt to her new surroundings, but as the plant does, she will be able to do so to. The other reason for ending the story like this @MONTH1 be to connect the story with the beginning. As  the hibiscus comes into play, the test is forgotten .However , wrapping up with this paragraph allows readers to remember her failing the  test and see the strength she will have to retake it .Altogether , this ending reaches deep into the readers hearts and @MONTH1 in the end inspire them to have the strength to overcome obstacles just like saeng "
3,"The last paragraph of the story, Winter Hibiscus, leaves the reader wondering what will happen later in Saengs life and inspires hope in her story. The last paragraph of the story reads, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story with that paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng has not given up on her new life, she just needs a little more time to adjust until she becomes more comfortable. For example, Saeng has not grown accustomed to eating @CAPS1 foods. When her mom is preparing an omelet with slices of bitter melon, she realizes no @CAPS1 would like this meal. But she admits to herself, she, much preferred to a Big Mac. This tells the readers Saeng is not comfortable with her new life. The authors last paragraph hints the reader that by next spring, Saeng will have adjusted. Another reason the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph is to let us know she is not giving up on her goal. Even though she failed her drivers test, she will try again. The last paragraph @MONTH1 also relate Saeng to the hibiscus plant. When the plant buds next spring is when she will retake the test. Maybe Saeng will also bud and become accustomed to @CAPS1 life. The last paragraph of the story successfully concludes Saengs journey"
3,This sentence was in the story to say that in the winter the flower will go away but it will soon come back in spring and go through its stages again.
3,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, I failed the test, (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence."
3,"Confidence, persistance, memories  all things that Saeng has that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, then I will take that test again, shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she wont give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saengs life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country."
3,"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to"
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it basically ties everything together. The places paragraph is explaining how Saeng refuses to give up and keep trying. This paragraph also presents the hard things she has to overcome and how Saeng will not give up. In a way the spring represents a new beginning and a new way at looking a thing. A way to learn, except and move on. Lastly, the paragraph saw Saeng determination by how she says, then I will take that test again. Saeng is a fighter."
3,"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because towards the end of the story when the winte hibiscus was in the ground the geese made a distinctive over her head and it slowly faded in to the distance so the author concluded that whe the geese come back in the spring when the hibiscus is budding she is going to see if the geese make a V over her head again, and thats the test she will take again. I also think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it probably interesting to see the geese with a V over their head so after winter is over she will see it again. That is why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.  "
3,"I think Saeng means that since the flower(hibiscus)Is budding, basically starting fresh all over again. And since the hibiscus can starting over then so can she. So  now Saeng  can start  fresh, and  maybe  she will pass the next time. From the quote in the spring, when  the  snows  melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.I will believe  its about  starting  fresh, all over again. And to take another chance to pass the test."
3,"The author brought out the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", to portray the theme of the story. Saeng used the hibiscus for hope in her life. The author also uses the choice of words or diction to explain the way Saeng lived her life depending on a flower. The paragraph also explains the way her culture is depending on the theme of the story."
3,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng  had failed a test and at the end, she vows to take it again. She bought the flower after she failed the divers test because it reminded her of home.  One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light srands of her grandmother`s long gray hair. The plant had helped remind Saeng of her old country and it comforted her after she failed her test. After seeing the geese flying, she promises to take her drivers test again when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding in the spring."
3,"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."
3,"I believe the author of thos story choose to end the story with this paragraph for many reasons. I think that she was trying to show how sometimes people try and if they fall, then they shouldnt rush at trying again. They should left and let some time go by in order to think. Also, I believe that she could be trying to say that as the plant begins to bud once again in the spring, the so will Saeng and she will be ready to once again take the test."
3,"The author chooses to conclude the story with that paragraph because it's a good conclusion of the story. By ending the story that way, the author shows Saeng's resilience to tough times and it shows how the hibiscus flower, reminding Saeng of her home, helped her get through hard times and helped her adapt to a new life, lifestyle, country, and home by reminding her of her grandmother and her old home back in Vietnam. That hibiscus flower is very important to Saeng."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he want to show the change in Saeng after he first test and when she boaght the flower to releive her. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she see this plant, he childhood comes back and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to get her lisence. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying, ... I will take the test again. In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become over her experience."
3,"The authar concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows saeng determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts saeng had right after her test it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, Here, let me help you mother,she offered (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is @CAPS1, gives saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she cant let just one thing hold her back in life. the support saeng has she will definetly pass the test the next time."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus, I think that the author concludes the story in when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story"
3,The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.
3,"The author seems to conclude the story with that paragraph because, its teaching a lesson. That just goes to show that Saeng accepted the fact the plant was take and it was dead and she had to become comfortable and adjust to her new country & environment which was different from what she was use to. Certain things reminded her as if she was still home and that seemed to be what hurted her the most. By her making that statement & vowing to herself after looking up at the geese gave more confidence, since she felt as if she failed. She had faith she wanted to try and do it all over again once the season changes & the snow melts. Showing that after a while she didnt give up now shes determined to take the test again."
3,I think the author concludes the story with that because so the girl could say she will retaking the test. and to show that she could try saying that she is going to retakeit. at also shows that she has try saying she will take it again. That is why I think the author had concluded the story with I will take the test again.
3,"I think the wauthor concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows us that she not giving up on the test. Even tho she failed it and was upset she not gonna ever take it again. Which is why she bought the flower so she can vatch it service threw water and budd by spring unlike the other hibiscus. The flower represents her make every girl in this world happy even if they dont like flowers. Trust me you can give any girl a flower and theyll love it and they will like you or forgive you. Her goal is to pass that drivers test, and that flowers goal is to service water and budd in spring after the snow melt, thats why Minfong Ho concluded the passage the way she did because the flower represents her goal."
3,"The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think hes trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again"
3,I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she wants to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The author ends the story this way to show that the girl reriese on the plant, and that it is all she has. An example to back this up is that the girl never talks about fiends in this piece which is rare for girls at that age. Also the author ends the story this way to make the reader think about this situation after they finish reading so they can imagine the rest of the story on their own. Also I think the author ends the story in this note in order to show the girls patience and maturity, and this shows the girl is intelligente and thinks things out."
3,"The author adds this paragraph with the story to show that their have been changes. Also that change @CAPS1t always bad. Saeng moved from her homeland, but still had things to remind her of her homeland. For example, the fake hibiscus she brought. Her mother was very upset that she spend a lot of money on it, but was very understand that it reminds her of her homeland."
3,"The author of the story concluded with sentence to show starting snow after everything that happened . When she first, failed Saeng  was very upset ,and probody wanted to give up you can tell this is true because of the words in the last sentence. Standing out the fact that she wants to continue of tagll snows that she must have been thinking of some point of giving up. Giving up and winter both symodies  the idea of something ending, whether r it be  the hope Saeng would have gotten had she have passed, or the ending of the year. Ending, in turn is generally met with gainess or greff because everything couldnt be accomplished, or something bad happened Saeng going into the flower shop and seeing the pisets from her old country bought both joy of going something fanitac  and pain because the memories she has time will never come again. However this joy she felt is the starting of a new beginning, just like a flower blooming or the geese returning. Its a new beginning where, whether  good or bad, the past is in the past and although you can look back of all the good times, there is nothing you can do about bad, so you  should learn from those things and do better. This ending sentence is like a moral, not just for Saeng, but for others who have been in similar situations before."
3,"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel."
3,I think that the author ends the text with that statement because everyone is given a second chance. I get this thought because the statement says when the snow melts. I think that the author is saying later in time your chance to change your action will come.
3,"The author concludes the story with that paragraph in hope. The conclusion the author made was to say in over that amount of time, Saeng will have overcome that failure and will be more prepared for the test for a second time. In the text, it says how Saeng realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before have become almost familiar which is an improvement."
3,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line .. Slowly fading into the distance. Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line  Through the quiet repition of season upon season.. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
3,"The auther includes this at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and that she seils brought back her back to her childhood. An example of her loving the plant is that rich scent"" (Paragraph Minfong Ho), @CAPS1 examples It felt smooth and cool (paragraph Minfong Ho) An example of to childhood's plan is that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten. she come back we could reed (paragraphs Minfong Ho) For these ways think that is why the author adds that at the end."
3,In the short story @ORGANIZATION1 vowed silently to herself that she will take the test again in the spring. She said that she was going to take the test again when she was feeling comfortable when she got down planting the Hibiscus. In the story it says she is still too shaky to say home because she misses it there. Now that she starting to get happy again because of the stuff that is reminding her she is going to take the test again. I think she is trying to get over the depressed stage that she is in. she is getting things to repersent things that was at her home.
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because a second time around for the plants to come and she thinks that you can have another chance for the test she took. For example, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"
3,"I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be shes saying that by that time shell be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her."
3,The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.
3,"The author concludes with the paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, to show and/or represent new life in a way. The hibiscus plant symbolizing new life and opportunity for Saeng. Throughouti the story, the hibiscus represents her ability to overcome obstacles and comfort in a time of disappointment. With that, I am to believe that when the hibiscus plant comes back and opens up, Saeng has the confidence and comfort to take the test again. Therefore, the author ends with that paragraph to represent Saengs new opportunity and confidence in taking the test."
3,"The authors choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reade knew that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is saying that you shouldnt give up. Like the saying, when you fall just get right back up and try again. For example, In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author means by this quote that she might of failed the first time but she is going to try again so she can pass the test."
3,"The author concludes the story with her saying she is going to take the test over again, when plant grows and the geese come back because it is a better way of letting the author know whats going on and whats helping her stay strong. For example in the story give talks about the smell of the flowers and that it reminds her of home. The flowers give her confidence and help her with the thought of her failing. Also she sees the geese leave and take a break from cold so she knows that she can take a break then go back closing the story with that paragraph helps the reader understand her mood with nature and how she connects it to her situations."
3,The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of reasons.
3,"Saeng ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to show that she is blending old life with the new one and to give herself time to accept change. The author states, almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of reason upon season, almost familiar to her now. This shows that shes learning to accept change and blend her lives together between her old home and her new one. However, she still isnt completely comfortables with it. She shows that she is willing to give it more time. Another statement Saeng makes is, ... and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. The quote demonstrates how determined Saeng is to form a part of herself that is both part of her homeland and her new home. She knows its not easy, lastly blending the hibiscus with the geese she is in turn blending Vietnam with @LOCATION2. By using this paragraph. Saeng shows her strength through pain and her newfound willingness to accept change."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to make the best of her life in @LOCATION1 even though its not like home. When Saeng comes across the flower she used to know from her childhood she has a flashback about the well, her grandmother, and the fine tooth comb she put in her grandas hair. The flowers brought her closer to the memories of the things she had and did in Vietnam. Saeng is shown determined when she states, When they come back then I will take the test again. Athough she failed the test she is willing to try again. The author uses the last paragraph to show the readers that although Saeng is not fully accustomed to the american life, she is willing to try harder and succeed. "
3,"The author ends the story in this way because she uses it as a sort of hidden meaning. When she says she will take the test again, she means she wants to try again, start over. When the geese return, which she also says, means they are coming back to start over. Finally, she says;  and this hibiscus is budding. That too means the flower is starting over, sort of like a new life. All these stood for her life, how she had to start over in her new home. It was like beginning a whole new life  filled with hard times and struggles that must be overcome."
3,The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didnt want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.
3,"The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there watste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over"
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it shows that the things that remind her of her homeland give her hope. The spring time, geese, and hibiscus are all familiar to her and give her comfort and hope in this tough time. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes- familiar to Saeng now. ""The geese had become familiar to Saeng now, and made her feel like she was at home and in a good place. A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengs eye now swept over her. The hibiscus reminded Saeng of her homeland and the memories there. Although it made her sad, it also comforted her by showing her that the plant she loved in Vietnam is also in her new home. That gave her hope that her new life in the new home will get better. She says she will retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus blooms, because they give her courage and strength. The author concludes with that paragraph for an important reason."
3,"When the author of Winter Hibiscus wrote the last paragraph he had the intention of taking all of Saengs actions so far, and combine them for use in the future. The author intentionally doesnt mention home, because Saeng is trying to get over her need for home, it is no longer something she needs. The hibiscus is mentioned that while she hasnt forgotten her home, she has moved on. We learn this when she goes into flower shop and remembers Vietnam, yet notes the difference between this flower and that. The geese returning shows the time of year that she will take the drivers test."
3,The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show the readers she was knocked down but she is going to get back up again and take the test again. This is also a very good way to end the story because it shows she is very determined to pass that test and wont give up and will do anything to pass it.
3,The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test. She was very disappointed . In The endit  showed she was not going to quit in this new country . She was going to move on and make the best of what she has.
3, The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower restarts its cycle and it gets another chance to bud and that symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when the starts over so she can do. it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope.
3,"The author trying to show how hard Saeng is trying to adapt to her new country but @CAPS1 to never forget her past experiences. After Saeng entered the flower shop she was overwhelmed by all the memories that flooded back to her by looking at the familiar flowers. For example she sees a saebba hedge and she remembers something after a monsoon rain a blossom or two would have blown into the well so when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket, @CAPS1  when she smells the blossom of a jasmine plant she closes her eyes and remembers, the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly washed as she combed  After she remembers these memories she breaks down and cries in the store. This is when she comes home with the hibiscus plant saying she failed the test when the author ends the story with the last words being, then I will take that test again, it shows that there is hope in adapting a new land. Change isnt always a bad thing even if it takes time to adapt to it nothing can take your past away from you"
3,"In the story winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng had failed the test before but wants to take it again to prove herself to her mother. She wants to prove to her mother that she can learn to live in this new place and let go of her old home a little bit. She had failed before because she went and spent a lot of money on a flower that was somewhat like the ones at her old home. She came home and told her mother I-I failed the test, her mother was shocked at first but then began to understand how her daughter felt. Her mother began to plant the flower and then went inside to cook dinner. Still feeling bad about failing the test, Saeng finished planting the flower and vowed that when the geese returned, she would take the test again.   "
3,"In Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho ends the story how she does to show a sign of hope. Saeng is going to start over when the world starts over. Spring is the time when animals come out of their winter holes, when trees blossom, and when the snow melts. It is a time of renewed. Saeng Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.Saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning. Saeng vows, Then I will take that test again. In the word choice of That test again depicts her new attitude. She wants to try again, her test.     """
3,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese returns and the hibiscus is budding then I will take test again. One of the reasons that the author concludes the story with the paragraph is because the author wants to give the character another chance at passing the test. Another reason is because maybe the author decided that in the spring it @MONTH1 be better to take the test. Maybe the author thought that if the geese came back it would be a sign that she would pass the test. And the winter hibiscus was another sign of luck."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The meaning of the paragraph is when Spring cames everything will be back to normally and @CAPS1 can start over again. The author is saying that in Spring Saeng will have another chance to take the test again. @CAPS1 means hve last spring over again. For example, Saeng, will be tested again when all the snow melts and geese return because @CAPS1 can do better this spring than last. This is what the author is reffering to in the last paragraph of the story."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author has more motivation in the spring than in the winter, since that is when the flowers bloom and she can see them and have a more comforting time seeing back on her past experience and that spring can give such joyious memories of her childhood."
3,"The author concludes the story in this way to symbolize adaption and starting again. she moved to the United States but misses Vietnam She thinks. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? ""This shows how she misses home but has to adapt. When it says she will have to take the test in spring, it represents that she will attempt to adopt and succeed when things are better. The last paragraph is about rebirth and a new start. The author includes it to add hope and a good feeling to a gloomy story. This is important because the author is sending a message. The author is saying that there is a time to mourn for losses, but eventually people must move on and continue with their lives.  "
3,She is saying when she comes back in the spring she will take the test. She said this silently to her self so that nobody else would here her. She said that she would be back when the snow melts and the geese come out. She also said that hibis cus is budding. She also told her mother every thing that she did when she came back.      
3,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show emotion. For example the tone of the paragraph shows that Saeng is determined to take the test again and that she wants to do the right thing and pass. Also it shows that she is willing to try again instead of giving up which is a strong characteristics. Finally it also leaves the read wanting to know more, like if she passes or fails on her second attempt. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.  "
3,Because she is going to practice and get better at driving and when the flower blooms she will go take the test agin. And she will try harder next time.
3,"I why would the author conclude the history with this paragraph? The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that there would be another oportunity and next time to re-do her test and do it better now that she has learn from past experiences. For example when she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It means that next seasson she would have the chance to do things right In conclucion this history show us that is never late to learn from our mistakes and there could always a chance to do things better and more quality. This relate to my life because often I am "
3,The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesnt want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.
3,"The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can over come something if you have the will power. Saeng failed the first test. She bought a plant that reminds her of home. She planted the plant despite the cold, hard ground. She realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life. She decided to retake the test. Saeng realized that even though you @MONTH1 fail once you have to keep trying if it is what you believe in. She also realized that she will never forget her home but she still can move on. Finally Saeng realized that good things can over come bad. After she failed the test she bought the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it summerizes the story perfectly."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, she decides to end the story with a paragraph saying that she would again take her drivers test when spring had arrived. I think the author decided to end the story like this to show saengs plans for the future saeng wants to try to drive when she is more accustomed to her surroundings. Saeng needs time to adjust to her soundings. When spring arrives, the temp. would be more like it was at home and the hibiscus would be something she could sort of look to When she was feeling home sick, to remind her of her time in Vietnam. Saeng says, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had season upon season, almost familiar to her now. The arrival of spring for @CAPS1 is going to make her feel more at home for her it she feels with this she would be able to pass her driving test"
3,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring its warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.
3,"In the short story, Winter Hibiscus, by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother? When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,"
3,"Spring represents a new begining. Saeng failed her drivers test and then felt very lonely. She saw a hibiscus in a flower shop, along with many other plants, and was over whelmed with emotions because she was not in her homeland where these plants grew naturally. Saeng was disappointed with herself when she failed her test. Then she was upset that she was not home. Her mother understood how her daughter felt and sympathized with her by accepting the plant and then planting it. Saeng was very grateful for this and was uplifted from her dreamy moon. Then she promised to herself that in the spring, the season new beginings, she would retake the drivers test with more confidence and a new out look on her circumstances. This is why she included the last paragraph in the story."
3,The author choses to end the story with this pagraph because it shows the true meaning of this story. That is determination and beauty. Saeng is determind to pass her driving test and she sees the beauty of the hibiscus in conclusion. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
3,"It includes this paragraph because its meaning that when the winter time is over she can take the test by filling her garden back up and test it by not letting the flowers or vegetable die, keep them healthy and fresh and nice. Instead of doing her school work. She would take it after the snow is gone."
3,"In Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughters actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didnt pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing."
3,I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she wont give up if they dont. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.
4,I dont think the story has one particular mood. Its not sad or happy. I guesse I dont understand it.
4,"The mood in ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives is very @CAPS2. @CAPS2 to have such parents that gave so much for him. And not only @CAPS2 but also grateful. Grateful to have such a family who are so selfless. (@CAPS3 @NUM1) ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir it is constantly repeated how gracious/grateful he really is. (@CAPS3 @NUM2) ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home.""  (grateful) The mood is definitely grateful because the feeling @CAPS1 is feeling is Grateful & @CAPS2."
4,"The @CAPS1 in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how @ORGANIZATION1 grew up and his meaning of family. His family was very genorous to the people in their @CAPS2. On paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have impacted his life today.Narciso parents were selfless. They would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more then @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more then @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a sense of pride in his family and community."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from cuba to the united States. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always let people who needed help in their home until they could get back on their feet, paragraph four. Their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for cuban cooking and music. Every One has such a great attitudes. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood."
4,"The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and loving. I say this because firstly, the author says that he lived in the neighborhood ""...made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm..."" and that ""...all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship..."". This shows that Narciso lived a varied but close and friendly community that went through the hardships together. Secondly, Narciso talks about how his parents installed in him a love of Cuban music, food, and family. Narciso also said that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that Narciso's parents taught him to treat everyone like family, because in a sense we all are  family, part of the human family. Lastly, Narciso says that his parents had to settle for any job they could get, but during that time they still kept their doors open, and they were always happy. This shows that even though times @MONTH1 be tough, people can still make the best of what they've got."
4,"In this memoir @PERSON1 describes the mood as warm and loving despite what his parents went through. First, in the second paragraph @PERSON1 explains that everything in his house formed the back drop to life in a warm house. @PERSON2 Rodriguez saying this affirms the fact of a warm loving household. Lastly @PERSON2 states at the end of the excerpt ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

It just talk's about all of the friend's and what they considered there family after they had left @CAPS1 much imident family behind from Cuba but only to make a better life for there children. The only down mood's in this selection is that the moved away from there home country and tradition but in which they still maintained a good Cuban tradition in there home. @CAPS1 the main mood described in this is to stay happy no-matter what ceremstances you are under in life."
4,"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author creates a positive, comfortable, and grateful mood for his opinion for his home. The author is proud of his home and proves it throughout the memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso describes the kitchen in his home in a funny tone to show his appreciation for it. ""A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Narciso also describes his family history but he doesn't sound sad to think about it, even though his family was unfortunate, indicating that he isn't ashamed. ""After living for a year in a furnished @NUM2-room apartment..."" In paragraph @NUM3, the author creates a thankful and grateful mood to his parents by thanking them and saying how they taught him his life lessons. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM4, Narciso concludes in a memorable mood to show how he'll never forget his home and his history, including the bad and good times. The author specifically creates a positive mood for readers to remember their homes too..."
4,"In the passage the author provided a good mood. for example he talked a lot about love, friendship, and other related things. He talked about the differences of a home and house. He made this passage for people to start thinking about what love realy is and what people will realy do for each other. He is a very good author."
4,"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blueprints of our lives the mood is heartfilling, and about appreciction. In the memoir @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 thanks his parents so much for everything they've done for him. @CAPS1 also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 knows it wasn't easy but loves how his parents managed to give him the best life possible. @CAPS1 writes, ""what they did was much more courageous then I could hae ever done."" @CAPS1 knows his parents took chances and did whatever to keep him happy which sets this mood to be so warm and heart filling."
4,"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our Lives shared his feelings, traditions, and Love he shared with his family growing up.Narciso and his @CAPS1 and dad were cuban. they shared their cuban traditions with eachother and were warm and welcoming with eachother and other people. Narciso's family was generous to other people and shared with everyone. they were all kind to eachother and lived a traditional @CAPS2.Narciso emphasized a mood during the memoir .. The love and meaning of family."
4,The created by the author is that he loves his parents for being so nice and caring to other family members. He loves how they always open there arms to family members that needs help till they get back on there feet. I think the mood is love and caring.
4,"The mood in This memoir is @CAPS1. Narciso Rodriguez is from a Cuban born and raised childhood he values everything they ever did for him.As stated in @CAPS2 @NUM1 of this passage he ""is eternally @CAPS3 for all that his family done wheather it was The @CAPS4 Cuban food they cooked him or weather it was the Cuban music They made him listen to. Growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non segregated individual. The mood he sets when narrating this is @CAPS1 because, not once did he ever take life for granted.""I will always be greatfull for what my parents showed within love and sacrifice, @CAPS6 ofen told them for what they have done was more couragoas Than i could have ever reached""."
4,"In his memoir, @PERSON1 talks about his childhood in his home and what his parents gave up to give him that. The mood that he creates in the story is thankfulness. He talks about everything that he had growing up. A modest home with great food always being cooked and great music always being played. All his family and friends close by in the comunity. And just a great overall envirment to be growing up in. Then he talks about what his parents gave up. They both had great jobs and they left for a distant country knowing they would have to start over and have nothing, looking for a better future. Then he talks about how thankful he is now. He says how he couldn't of done that, and how he has thanked them many times and that there is no way he can express his gratitude. He is very thankful."
4,"There are many ways to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir. For example, when she was talking about her family and dinner she uses a metaphor to make you feel certain emotions. She says, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast-always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" @CAPS1 example is when she tries to make you feel sad and empathetic. When she was talking about her family and how, ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2, they tried to make the reader feel close and like they have a family that loves them. When it says, ""It was a close knit communly of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" In conclusion, these are some of the ways the author used mood in memoir."
4,The mood created by the author showed me to be happy with what I have and to be grateful for what I am givin. I learned this from all the moods the author expressed in his memoir of his life. As I state this is the mood the author expressed.           abd
4,"The mood created by the author is outstanding. The mood is nice, and warm-hearted. the author talks about how the heart of the home is in the kitchen; and how cuban music is always playing this sets a happy, cheerful mood. then, the author talks about how their home is always open and welcome to family and friends. this sets a warm, loving mood finally, the author talks about the cuban feasts and close relatives he has after reading the story, you feel like part of the family."
4,"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."""
4,"The mood in this except from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez is one of him being happy and @CAPS1. He talks about his Life as a child and growing up in a Cuban family. One example is family members ""came and went staying with us until they could get back on their feet."" @PERSON2 talks about the kitchen being the heart of our home and instilling a love of cooking which is still with him today."
4,"The mood is set to a sad feeling. Filled with poverty the auther sets it up this way. There is a mood of love too. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It also says that they learned the real definition of family. this is why it is set too a sadly love mood. They were an immigrants. This memoir is inspirational."
4,"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."
4,"The author, Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart."
4,"The mood the author created in the memoir is a roller coaster. It goes up and down. At the beginning of this story, it was quit deppressing. It's basically just Rodriguez describing the crummy quarters he lived in. But, as the story progresses, it is filled with happiness and even though living conditions werent all that great, he still had fun. In the end, home is about relationships rather than physical space."
4,"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives."", The mood created by the author is friendly because where she grew up the setting creats a friendly mood. According to @CAPS1 @NUM1, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The mood is friendly because with all her/his family coming made a friendly mood. When talking about her neighborhood, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Although it is segregated the neighbors are still friendly and it created a mood of friendly because every one is united despite racism. The mood is also friendly because her family always were nice to people. When talking about her family members, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). The neighbors and her family made a friendly mood because they always were nice and let each other in their homes. The mood created by the author is friendly."
4,"In the memoir, the author creates a very calm and @CAPS1. I know that the author creates that mood @CAPS2 there is no signs of anger or anything like that included in the article. There is a @CAPS1 mood @CAPS2 the author talks about how home isnt about features, its about family and mood. Another way the mood in the memoir is created is @CAPS2 in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""The many things I learned about love."" the author says how his family turns a normal house into a @CAPS1 home which creates a very calm mood @CAPS2 the author states his feelings in the memoir and there is no sign of anger or any signs of him being mad @CAPS3 it is a very calm mood. In the last reason why I think the mood is very calm and @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 of his Family the author says how his family absolutley changed his house shows a complete sign of love and respect. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I learned the real definition of family which obviously shows that he loves and respects his family. that is why I think that there is a calm and @CAPS1 mood in this memoir."
4,"A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say ""my parents will always be there for me."""
4,"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a happy one. The authors telling all about his life. He tells what made him happy. He loves the fact that his parents both gave him great cooking skills. He is very grateful for the Cuban culture they brought into his life. They played Cuban music and he still adores the music. He describes his culture with enthusiasim and happiness. Over and over again he says how much he enjoys his culture. The mood of happiness also comes from him explaining his family. By family it didn't necessarily mean blood relatives. He enjoyed their presence none the less. As he explains his huge ""family"", of neighbors and friends, you can just sense the love he has for them. Lastly he chose the mood of happiness by talking about his parents. He adores them and feels like they did the best job raising him. Even though the completley started over when they moved to the US. The author's mood in this memoir radiated from every word he wrote and makes the reader's heart warm."
4,"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"""
4,"The author in the memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our lives creates the mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents.One example of how the author shows gratitude is by mentioning how thankful he is toward his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves this is ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful"". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 the authors use and repititon of the word ""grateful"", or ""thankful"" creates a mood.Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS2 this quotation the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration."
4,"In the memoir of @PERSON1, the author shows a lot of mood throughout the story. Happy and grateful stand out as the two most important moods.      @PERSON1 is very grateful throughout the memoir. He is grateful of his friends and family. His caring and selflessness parents. Also all of the hard work they do and what they gave up back in Cuban in order to come to @LOCATION1. His dad worked in the laboratory and his mom studied chemichal engineering. Lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home.          Another mood is happiness. In the first paragraph parenthesis mean that he really enjoys cooking and Cuban music. He is also very proud about his Cuban @CAPS1 and how his extended family stays with him.            This memoir has a lot of mood in it and it makes it a lot better."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is made up of happeness, love, and lastly respect for his parents, whitch shows how the mood is actually peaceful. In the memoir the author stated memeries of his neighborhood that was good. The authors stated about how the cultures formed together, helped each other and worked hard to make a living as well is a future for their kids, which shows his respect for his friends and family. The author states his gratitude toward the hard ships his parents went through for him and for the dream of a better tomorrow."
4,"Reading this article expresses many different mood changing from the auther. While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culter explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most important his so greatful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him sucuss in life and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. He mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of ""family"", meaning his family was there for each other and and love was all over. This pasage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I success, so I can say I can relate to the auther."
4,"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" is very simple. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 and grew up in Newark, New Jersey. Being Cuban, Rodriguez seems to be grateful for almost everything. The mood the author creates in the memoir is being grateful. Narciso is very grateful for his culanary skills. Another thing Narciso is grateful for is how much her parents had given up for her. They left family, friends and careers in the country that they loved. They also struggled personally and financially, working as hard as they can. The last reason why he is grateful because his parents turned his house into a home.Another mood the author creates in the memoir is happiness. Narciso seems to be happy about everything. Rodriguez seems to be happy when listening to Cuban music. Narcio was almost always happy around his house with his friends and family. Narciso Rodriguez seems like a very positive person."
4,"The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful, remembering his childhood home, his family life that includes his neighbors and extended family Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of being home and being surrounded by people you love. He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"". He feels that this is one of the reasons his childhood house was turned into a home."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir has a very good description. First, the author describes the mood in the begining of the story by telling me where her parents came from and all about them. Second, the author describes the middle of the story by telling me how he grew up and what his life is like and lot more about him. Third, the author also tells me that the boy loves and misses his parents so much. Finally, he also tells me how he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home. This is how the mood created the author in the memoir with a very good description."
4,The mood of this story was moving and imigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1. It also describes what his life was like. It just tells you how he got here and how he has improved.
4,"The author in this memoir creates a forgetfull, caring, and a happy mood. An @CAPS1 of a forgetful mood is, ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love + sacrifice."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). This @CAPS6 this memoir creates a forgetful mood because it talks about how she was having @CAPS3 and courage. An @CAPS1 of a caring mood that the auther creates is, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly"". (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This @CAPS6 that this memor creates a caring mood because the parents are proud of him/her and care for him in the future.

4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir. She talks about having heritage in her family with he Cuban backround and her parents turning their small home into the likes of a Cuban home. Also the happiness she has in her little community all different cultures and people really brings them together. Her parents had given her everything she really needed and or wanted in her little house. She didn't need a big house or expensive things, all she needed was a good family in their home to keep her happy."
4,"The mood in this memoir is very loving and kind. I say this because in this story the narrator talks about the life and how they very much appreciate what their parents did. The narrator also knows what the true meaning of ""love"" is."
4,"The mood the auther was puting in is he want people to imagen a young boy who moved to a new country and Is grateful and thankful that he has the opportunite to do something. Every though he moved he stilled the place his home. What it means is no matter Where you are in the world a place you have love, friends, family and happiness is a home. You can move over all over and call though places home."
4,"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why."
4,"The mood of this passage is very warm and personal. Narciso is very reflective in this passage about how his parents were so unselfish and gave up their life in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. Narciso goes on saying how unselfish his parents are, and how they take people in to give other people a better life not just themselves. Narciso's parents were very caring, and very meaningfull to him. He continues the mood by talking about what a true family is. How it's not just someone your blood related to, but who you care about and love."
4,"There are few moods created. They are comfort, Love and sacrifice. Comfort because of the way @PERSON1 described his home, parents, and neigborhood families. Love because his parents loved him and each other very much, and they cared about what they did and their family. Sacrifice because his parents sacrificed their comforting home to move to @LOCATION1 for their son. That was difficult for them, but @ORGANIZATION1 appreciated that. He loves his parents what they did for him."
4,"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)"". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". The author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the authors mood was."
4,"In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house."
4,first he was depressed by the house. Now he was happy for the house they were gonna  get. his parent were selfless to protest their own child.
4,NArciso Rodriguez is talking about his home. He is saying that his family were better when they were living in cuba they had there own jobs. But then one Day they arrived in the united states. They had started there carrer over agian because they came to live in @LOCATION1.They started to pick there own @CAPS1 jobs because they had left there own jobs back home. One had to work as an chemical engineering and the other one had to work as a laboratory they had to @CAPS2 the jobs that they pick even if they @CAPS3't like it at all either way they are going to need to work. so they could pay for taxes house bills and electricity. Thatz what happens if people moved to @CAPS1 country.
4,"The mood that is described in this story is love. Why did I pick love? I picked love because in the story it says a lot of stuff about family and Cuba and home (Cuba, is where the love (family) is. In this story is states that his love comes from his family and love comes from every family and @PERSON1's loves his family he says it alot in the story."

They made a simple little house into a great home for everyone. They gave up great jobs for him so the could move to america. Him saying that @CAPS2 can't even show How grateful @CAPS2 is in that ther selfless shows his thankful and loving mood
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky. I say this not to make fun of anyone but to thank them. The author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking. This piece of evidence is located in paragraph two. The mood is described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated. This is because the author is starting to figure out what it's like to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture. This evidence is located in paragraph @NUM1. The authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet. His/@CAPS1 parents did this so whenever they needed anything than they would be alright. This final piece of evidence is located in paragraph seven. These are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir. (And also of where they are located)."
4,"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood created by the author is gratefull and family. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez talks about his life growing up.

4,"Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That statement shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families.

""I've often told them of my admiration for there strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud @CAPS1 is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that @CAPS1 could have a better life in @LOCATION1. Narciso says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1's saying that @CAPS1's very happy that his parents did that for him. Many quotes from the memoir support and set the mood to describe Narciso's life."
4,"The mood created by the authors memoir is the familys, children, friends. The author is talking about how some lifes. The story is old because it is talking about 1956, 1961, and like the 1970's. The story takes place in New Jersey."
4,"The author creates a mood in the memoir. The author describes family. As the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1) This gives off a caring mood. The author describes opening up to anyone. As the author mentions ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" (@NUM2) The author lastly describes giving up things for the people you love. As the author states ""They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (@NUM3) This shows a mood of selflessness and loving."
4,"Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and greatful mood throughout the memoir. He did this @CAPS1 never premoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped eachother. Fer example in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir."
4,"The mood created by the author in this memoir is happiness, love, caring, and unity. As it said in paragraph @NUM1 ""family had nothen to do with being blood relative."" Family represents love and caring about each other. Also when the author talked about his parents leaving Cuba and all thier jobs, friends, relatives, and properties behind to come to @LOCATION1 all because of thier children's future shows a true love of a guardian. Not everyone will have the courage to do this but instead her family came all this while for thier sakes starting thier entire life all over with financial problems and all the troubles they went through, they sacrificed all of it for thier children, and that's what I call love. In conclusion, the mood the author created in the memoir was indeed strong and heart touching. He revealed all the things a parent wants for thier children no matter any cercumstances that will come between them and thier determination for thier posterity of the family's existance."
4,"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a positive, greatful mood. The author ""will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" I know because a writes a few paragraphs just to show how thankful @CAPS1 is to his parents. @CAPS1 describes how great their jobs were in Cuba and then how poor they became in the @LOCATION1, but yet they still worked hard to give their children a better life. ""In a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 describes everything, as a positive learning experience, but shows that throughout the memoir, the theme is positive and greatful."

In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates the mood."
4,"I think that the mood in the memoir is @CAPS1 I think that this would be the mood in this memoir @CAPS5 in paragraph @NUM1 - @DATE1 it talks about how Narciso lived in a apartment and moved in a home. @CAPS3 thinks its very amazing @CAPS5 the apartment @CAPS3 lived in only had one bed-room and the one @CAPS3 lives in now has three bed-room. I also think @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 doesnt just have his own room but his landlord lives above him with children who are friends with Narciso how @CAPS3 thinks its an awsome place. I would also think this is the mood for this memoir @CAPS5 it fits with Narciso and @CAPS3 @CAPS1 about what just happened. It also fits with the memoir @CAPS5 it talks about how his parents get along, who does this, who that. It talks about how his life might of changed when @CAPS3 moved @CAPS5 it was a whole different story when @CAPS3 lived in the apartment. I think this mood fits the best with this memoir. "

This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship.""

5,"There were many obstacles they faced in trying to make something that would allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. If they let a dirigible dock the back end would swing freely and they couldn't put weights there cause there were people below. Most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If something happened to a dirigible over downtown New York like what happened to the Hindenburg there could have been a major problem."
5,"As it was the idea of a dirigibles dock was quite far fetched THe first problem thay encountered was that having a thousand foot long dirigible attached to the empire state building would cause a great strain on the buildings framework, @CAPS1 they would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen which is extremely flammable, also the author states ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" making the idea of a dirigibles dock extremly to risky. They should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Although the mast was finished due to @CAPS1 Nature a new law no dirigibles has ever docked at the Empire State Building."
5,"In the reading comprehension ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock because they wanted to add the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof and the dirigibles would be able to take the mooring mast up to the top of the building. The architects found out that if they put the mooring mast on the top of the building its gonna bring stress to the building's foundation."
5,"By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles that they faced was the re-desgning of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" that meant that they had to make modifications (over @MONEY1 worth). Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe."
5,"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are: @CAPS1 they choose dirigible instead of balloon, because the fabric used in dirigibles is lighter. Second, their extended use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area and think about the safety of passengers get in or get off"
5,"Around the time of the year 1929, engineers in New York City set out a challenge to construct a mooring mast atop of the Empire State building. However, little did the engineers know of the many problems that they would soon have to face. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's article, The Mooring Mast, it is explained that safety factors, nature, and laws would prove to be problematic for engineers. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""... hydrogen is highly flammable"". This would be problematic since it's also above populated New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 is explained how violent shifting air currents would cause the dirigibles to become unstable, which is dangerous because it is still hovering over pedestrians. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it states, ""... an exsisting law against airships flying too low over suburban areas"", which made it illegal for airships to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment used in building mooring masts, land dirigibles service and a workable arrangement, and modify the building for support of the mast.In preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the @ORGANIZATION1. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean. A workable arrangement had to be created. It was difficult and tedious to figure, ""on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast."" The foundation of the building had to be considered as well because, ""the architects could not simply dropping mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Over @MONEY1 in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed. All of these were obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Building. One of the greatest reasons was saftey, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is also highly flammable. Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to moor a dirigible"
5,"When building the empire state Building, the workers faced a few problems. One was how to make it @CAPS1, because the architect building the chrysler building had raised the total height, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, former governor of new york, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was @CAPS2 the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the Public. Thus, the mast was never used."
5,"Builders faced some obstacles attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock near or at the Empire State Building. The dirigibles were great on top speed that could go up to @NUM1 miles per hour, and could go for thousands of miles with out refueling the dirigibles. But it had a little problem. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith had an opportunity to the building. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building that would allow the dirigibles to dock there for several hours, and Passengers to go on and off the dirigibles. Also, the dirigible were docked by an electric winch, which ran down the front of the dirigible and tied onto the mast. While the dirigible was hanging around in the air, Passengers could walk down the gangbank to an open observation platform."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. On obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The back of the dirigible would be swinging around and could fall or hit something. Another obstacle they faced was the dirigibles could be set on fire. The dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" A dirigible from @LOCATION1, Hindenburg, was destroyed due to fire. The last obstacle the workers faced was the law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to tie up to the Empire State Building. The workers who built the Empire state Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all when they started building they knew they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the flat roof; so they needed to modify and strengthen the steal of the building to accommodate for the mooring mask. Also they never thought about how dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium was extremely flamable. Nature was another thing to consider because the winds were constantly shifting. There was a law stating that airships flying too low over urban areas could not happen. It would be a safety hazard for the people who live there. All of those obstacles happened to the builders building the Empire State Building by trying to put on the mooring mask."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles to allow dirigible's to dock there. What these builders were facing was a thousand foot derigible moored at the top of the building, the height of the Empire State Building is 1,250 ft. Adding the single cable tether would add to much stress to the buildings frame, the workers would need to modify and strengthen the buildings frame. Another problem they didn't realize at first was the wind, from violent air currents. With all these problems that were not easily fixed, eventually the idea of a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building dissapeared."
5,"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. Thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. To suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of New York. Also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" A quote by Al Smith. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the empire state Building"
5,"The first obstacle in building a mooring mast, was the stress it would add to the building's framework when a dirigible is docked. The building's entire @CAPS1 frame required over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to allow the pressure from the dirigible to travel down to the building's foundation. Although the modifications were made, the docking equipment was not installed following the 1937 Hindenburg disaster, which revealed the dangers of a dirigible exposion over a densely populated City. As well as laws restricting aircrafts from flying low over urban areas, the mooring mast was not practical due to intense winds at the top of the building. Violent wind currents would cause the back of a dirigible to swing out of control. There was no safe way to anchor the back of a dirigible high over downtown New York."
5,"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenging obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock.The main obstacle builders face was to keep stress from the dirigibles transfer through the Empire State Building. They needed to modify the building's structure to be able to handle not only the dirigible's load when it docked but also the wind pressure. By trying to modify the building it was going cost a lot, which became the builder's next obstacle. The new modifications for the building's structure or framework would sum up to over sixty thousand dollars. Along with the new modifications the builders also had to make sure all new structures added for the dirigibles were very decorative but worked efficiently.In conclusion these were the many challenging obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by allowing dirigibles to dock."
5,"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people."
5,"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as an attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.  In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders spaced.  ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""  This is because the wind.  The wind would shift due to violent air currents."
5,"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. ""When the German dirigible '@CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1) This shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (paragraph @NUM2) The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then, dropped."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it the derigible would add stress to the building's Frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings Frame."" Even though the builders made the mooring mass it was to unsafe to moore dirigibles from the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" In all the builders were faced with to many obstacles and could not manage to moore the dirigibles to the building."
5,"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building."
5,"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State building's ""majestic spire"" is familiar to a lot of people, but they don't know the original purpose of it. After his fourth term time as the New York @CAPS1, Al Smith wanted the mast to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, or blimps. Although many people went along for the ride of this construction, there were many obstacles. First, there was not a lot of suitable landing area as some blimps for as long as one thousand feet. Also, the architects had to find a clever way to drop a mooring mast. As the author said, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings framed"" @CAPS2, the most difficult obstacle was the unpredictable weather and mother nature. As described in the article, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Overall, the building of the Empire State Building was very difficult."
5,"Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some @ORGANIZATION1 of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service."
5,Based on the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 there was obstacles that the builders faced in the attemp to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building One obstacle they faced was they didn't have a landing area. Al Smith wanted to have this so dirigibles could anchor on the the mast so they could get refueled. This is hard because the dirigibles could swing in the breeze. I think this is to complicated to do because it could easily go wrong.
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM1). Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ @NUM2). One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶ @NUM3). With all of these obstacles it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building."
5,"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind speeds at that height were strong, violent, and unpredictable. The back of the ship sould swing around and there was no way, at that height, to stable it. There was also a law in place that prohibitat airships from Flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up at the Empire State Building. Also, dirigibles themselves weren't always safe. Dirigibles from outside the States used hydrogen instead of helium to get lift, but hydrogen is highly flammable. An explosion from atop the Empire State Building would be very dangerous."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One, many of the air ships were using hydrogen and not helium, which was very flammable and not safe. A Second obstacle was weather and climate. The winds that high up would cause the ship to constantly shift. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down the back with lead weights, but using this at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the streets"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). That would be a very dangerous situation having heavy lead blocks above the people in the city. The third obsticle was it said aircraft could not fly that low over urban areas. The dirigible could easily get punctured from other buildings in the area as well. Those are the obsticles the builders faced."
5,"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she relives and describes the many problems in the creation of the failure known as the mooring mast. She also states the leader of the failed project whom was Al Smith. Al Smith jumped right into an idea without thinking it through, all he was thinking about was 'one-upping' the constructers of the Chrysler Building. Instead he should have been thinking or at least consulting architects about the effects of a dribble crash like the ""Hindenburg,"" which was filled with ""hydrogen rather than helium."" Other problems @PERSON1 failed to think about where the ""violent air currents,"" ""dangling [@CAPS1] high above pedestrians,"" and ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [due to] existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas,"" were all problems for the designing team. Al Smith got ahead of himself without first doing his research, in a sense he started to run before he could walk."
5,"The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to follow dirigibles to dock there; the greatest reason was one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the united states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, using these at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical or safe."
5,"In the attempt to allow dirigibles or blimps to dock at the Empire State Building they faced many obstacles that, ended up changing the whole purpose of the docking area.The main issue builders faced was mother nature in general. It was stated that the winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to the violent wind currents, the blimps end would be tossed around and around, and also dangling over pedestrians in New York City at almost 11 hundred feet high.The second main issue builders faced was the law that stood against airships during that time. The law stated that no airships could fly too low over urban areas, therefore making the idea of docking blimps on the Empire State Building illegal as well as unlikely and dangerous for many citizens.In conclusion the two main issues that builders faced was the @LOCATION2's nature, and the laws against the entire idea that hadn't been realized."
5,"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One example is, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the builders realized that hydrogen is flammable, they had to rethink the construction for if there was a fire it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The chances of people getting hurt or injured are more likely. Another obstacle was, ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This was a major obstacle because the builders would have been violating a law. It would also be very dangerous."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to fly their aircraft. Since hydrogen is more flammable than helium, a terrible catastrophe could have taken place and it would have been worse over the densely populated New York. Second, nature was an obstacle that the builders faced. The air currents at the top of the Empire State Building caused the winds to constantly shift. The back of the ship would swivel around and it could jar the passengers around. The only way to prevat it from moving was to put lead weights in the back, but these were unsafe above New York pedestrians. The final obstacle faced was the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The fear was that the winds could push the dirigible into buildings and it shell would be punctured, causing dirigible to plummet to the ground. Many obstacles presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building."
5,"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many factors in the way of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building realized quote how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes is so that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle of all however, was mother nature. The winds that high in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and would be unsafe to passengers and pedestrians on the street below. All of these factors contributed to the project never being fulfilled in New York."
5,"There are many different obstacles the architects should have thought about before hand.  One of the greatest with safety.  Most blimps outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen.  is very flammable.  For example, when the German dirigible, @PERSON1, was destroyed in a fire in @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 owners of the Empire state building realized the great risks such as if the fire was in a more densely populated such as downtown New York.Another big obstacle to the success of the mooring mast with nature.  The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  Even when the dirigible's were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mass.  When dirigibles were mourned in open landing fields, the back could be weighed down with lead weights, but when its dangling high above pedestrians on the street it was neither practical nor safe.There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This made it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."
5,"The builders of the empire state building had to face alot of obsticles to try to get dirgibles to land there. One of those obsticles was making ""changes to existing Plans for the building's stelfame"". Another thing was nature the winds would not let a blimp land there. But the greatest reason was safety: ""Most dirigables from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable""."
5,The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obsticles was finding a safe way of mooring airships to the mast. They had a very hard time figureing this out because it was unheard of and nobody had done it before. Another obstacle they faced was putting the mooring mast on top of the building. This was a obsticle for them because the building was not built to hold a thousand- foot dirigible moored to the top with a single cable. This would cause stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure to be transmitted all on the buildings foundation.This caused them to have to modify and strengthen the building just to accommodate the situation. The cost of the modofications was over sixty thousand dollars. One other obstacle to this was the problem of nature. This problem was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. This was a problem because even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship could still move freely. The last obsticle they faced was the law against airships flying to low over urban areas.
5,"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over @MONEY1 to make the modifications nesescary to do this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" @CAPS1, they did not solve several other obstacles. Forein dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivll around the mast. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end there were too many obstacles so the dirigible docking plan was scrapped."
5,"After reading this excerpt by Marcia Amidon Lüsted from @ORGANIZATION4, I learned a lot about problems the people who built the Empire State Building faced. Al Smith, who was leading the construction efforts wanted to out-do the height of the Chrysler Building. He set out to create a top to the Empire State Building that they said ""would serve a higher calling"", they said it would equip the building for ""an age of transportation that was then only a dream of aviation pioneers."" They were going to create a mooring mast for docking dirigibles, better known today as blimps. Unfortunately, they ran into a lot of trouble @CAPS1 the way.The architects had to modify the building's structure in order for it to be strong enough to support the Mast. Although, as @ORGANIZATION5 says, ""The mooring mast was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should've been apparent before it was ever constructed"" Hydrogen is used in dirigibles, and it is highly flammable. This @CAPS1 with many other things are problems that caused this plan to fail."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with dirigibles. The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accomadate the @NUM1 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are obstacles the builders faced when building the Empire State Building."
5,"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in @CAPS1 to allow dirigibles to dock there, It was hard because the architecs were blind to the potential problems of the mast. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing erea. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four block in New York City. This was an obstacle that builders from the Empire State Building faced."
5,"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was lack of a suitable landing area. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four bocks in New York City. A solution to this problem, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. It was also easier to let passangers on and off. Another obstacle was the dirigibles weight It would add a great deal of stress and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1' worth of modifications had to be made."
5,"The outlandish, impossible idea of docking airships on the Empire State Building was not followed up on for many reasons. First, for the reason that hydrogen is flammable. It would be a disaster for a dirigible to go up in flames, particularly over a crowded city like New York. The high-speed winds at 1,250 feet were dangerous and constantly shifting. Normally when airships docked, they were tied down to prevent their back ends from swinging around, but at the height of the docking station that was just impossible. Finally, there was a law that said dirigibles couldn't dock too low over cities because of the danger of crashing in surrounding buildings."
5,"one of the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constant shifting due to the violent air currents."" This was a huge obstacle because the back of the ship will swivel around. This was also bad because not only its the wind and obstacle, but also the hight is. Or the dirigible was maybe at an lower hight it would'nt be causing all these wind problems. The reason I say this is because the wind swivels the ship around because it is so high up. In my opinion the wind bothers/has more violent air currents at such a high level. one of the other many obstacles was also because the law was practically against it. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". To me this was a major obstacle because maybe the law was scared that an airship might crash into one of the buildings or houses. How ever the main obstacle was finding a landing area. Reason why this was the main obstacle in my idea is because where would the ship leave the people at. The ship cant stay floating above the Empire state Building and let the people get out how they got it. If they would've done that the ship would've sinked down. So to conclude the obstacles that was'nt letting disirigibles dock there was nature (wind), hight, law, and landing area."
5,"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first idea was to add a plat form and conect the dirigible to the spire, Then after consulting with the profesionals the builders reconstructed the skeleton of the building. alot of extra work was put into the dirigibles idea, but at the end New York was left with only a building."
5,"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there, according to the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. Architects were nearly blind to the potential problems of the mast that would dock the dirigibles. One of the problems was that the weight from the dirigible's load would have to be accounted for, throughout the entire building so the nearly half built tower would need to be modified. According to @ORGANIZATION2 in paragraph @NUM1, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This was a big obstacle @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 considering they were halfway through the build. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework. Another obstacle @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 was the enviroment on top of the Empire State Building. Violent winds were constantly changing, posing a problem of how would the dirigibles anchor there without being tossed around by wind? @ORGANIZATION2 writes in paragraph @NUM2, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This violent movement was dangers for passengers and was due to high winds @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in their attempt to dock dirigibles there."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building had run in to many struggles due to problems such as building, and constructing the mooring mast.The main purpose of this building was for the new ""age of transportation"". Without installation of the landing gear workers had to go to the top to catch bundles of newspapers by rope. When breezy days came around dirigibles could not drop of supplies because of the fact that the point of the building could puncture a whole into the shell. There was also a law that was created to prevent airships from flying to low over urban areas.I honestly believe that they should have went over the issues they encountered before going through all the trouble of building the Empire State building."
5,"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was having to make changes on a lot of things. The mast needed a lot of work. ""The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."" - Marcia Amidon Lüsted. Also the builders realized there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas That law messed up the plan on allowing dirigibles to dock there. Also the weather messed up the mooring mast for the dirigibles because the wind would blow the drigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area. Those were some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there."
5,"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the competition with the @CAPS1 building, stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the dirigible gases and the airship law. To begin with, the @CAPS1 building was going to be 46 ft higher than the Empire State building, so builders had an obstacle in their hand and came up with building a top that would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet, taller than the @CAPS1. Also, the idea with the dirigible tieing up to the building's top would add more stress to the building and the wind pressure, would be transferred to the buildings foundation. Builders had to modify and strengthen the building, which cost @MONEY1. Another reason, was that dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable. There had been an accident in @LOCATION2 when their dirigible caught on fire. "", the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could've been if it took place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS4, there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it so dirigibles couldn't fly because they were to low and was a safety hazard. In conclusion, to many obstacles faced builders while building the Empire State building, which led it to be a place for tourism and for the public."
5,"Based on the excerpt It shows in some way's there were obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles or Blimps to dock there. One of those examles were found in paragraph @NUM1. It said ""The mooring mast of the empire State building was designed to never fulfill its purpose."" Another One was Also in paragraph @NUM1 when they said ""The greatest reason was one of safty: Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in lakehurst, New, Jersey, the owners of the empire state building relized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated Area such as downtown New York. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says that nature was a big obsticle for the success of the mooring mast. The winds on the tops of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another reason was because of existing laws was airships flying too low over populated or urban areas."
5,"The @CAPS1 of the empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The @CAPS2 major concern was for safety. After the Hindenburg caught fire, because it used Hydrogen instead of Helium, the @CAPS1 pondered the thought of what were to happen if it happened above a densley populated area like downtown New York. Another problem was the back of the blimp would continue to spin around the mast even when anchored."
5,"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragety, and the law.The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safty hazard because even if the dirigible was secured the back would swing a cause a potential hazzard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May, 6, 1937 the hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe so this created many obsticles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there."
5,"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia Lüsted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened."
5,If drigibles were allowed to dock on the empire state building there is many potential problems. The drrigibles would be moored down to the mast but the wind is so strong that it would move the backend of it. The Navy drigible called Los Angeles was opposed to a serious wind force and the Captain of the airship couldn't even let go of the controlls because the wind was so powerful. A goodyear blimp tried to dock at the building but they couldn't because of the wind. But also the blimps are filled with Hydrogen and it is highly flamable. The hindenburg was a blimp that crashed in @LOCATION3 and the flamable gas ignited. If that accident happened in New York City many people would end up dying.
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps to dock there. At first Al Smith, who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building, was really trying to win ""... the title of world's tallest building..."" against the architect building the Chrysler Building. Then Al Smith had an idea that would make his building over @NUM1 taller than the Chrysler building. Al Smith decided he would add a to the building to serve as a mooring mast for derigibles. ""The Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made..."". ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with the experts..."" to make sure everything would be safe and in check. The builders went through such trouble and ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose..."". After so much work and effort the mooring mast never got put to use because ""Dirigibles moored... at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""
5,"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring Mast of the building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. One example is most dirigibles from the outside the United States used hydrogen. The united States mainly used helium, witch is not flamable like hydrogen. Luckily the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle to the builders was nature. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. This made it unsafe for the pedestrians down below. these are the obstacles the builders had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."
5,The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. A major problem is that dirigibles are filled with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. If a dirigible was to ever ignite while trying to dock it could set the entire building on fire. Another problem was just the sheer height of the empire State Building. If a gust of wind would catch the side of the dirigible it could push it straight into the building. Another problem was this act would be illegal due to the law restraining airships from flying too low in urban areas.
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 is about a landing spot dirigibles. The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles allowing dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would make it illegal for a ships approach the area. In paragraph fourteen it says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights."" It wouldn't be safe for pedestrians on the streets. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State building are competitive of having the world's tallest building but they haven't thought of the greatest reason was safety"
5,There are some obstacles the builders face during this time while building the Empire State Building. One of the issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to fix a mast at a height desirable to postpone installation to a later date. The Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fulfill its purpose. For reasons it should have been apparent before it was constructed. And another obstactle was the lack of a suitable landing area.
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building."
5,"When Al Smith, the head of construction of the empire state building, decided to add a mooring mast at the top to insure that it would the tallest building in the world he left many major obtisicles unadressed. They wanted to put a mooring mast at the top of the building so that zeppelins could dock there and let off passengers and cargo but during construction nobody dressed the problem of high, a radical winds that could untether the zeppelin from the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lüsted) Al Smith also over looked that zeppelins are mostly filled with flammable gas and it would be extremly dangerous to have something so flammable floating over a major city. Zeppelins could also not more at the Empire State Building because it was illegal. An aircraft of that size would not be allowed to fly so love over the city."
5,"Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was a complex and difficult task. The main problems were: the wind, the building's structure, the flamability of hydrogen gas, and the location. At an elevation of @DATE2 feet the driving force of the wind would be enough to stop dirigibles from mooring correctly. When the Los Angeles attempted tie to the mooring mast in @DATE1 the winds were too great, and the dirigible was pushed away. The problem with the building's structure is that when the dirigible ties in it will cause too much stress to the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly @NUM1 feet below."" (paragraph @NUM2). The force of dirigible moving around at the top of the mooring mast would damage the building and its foundation. Since New York is a port city many foriegn dirigibles filled with hydrogen gas would dock at the Empire State building. These dirigibles would be filled with highly flamable hydrogen gas, the gas would all ignite if it came in contact with a flame. The final problem was the fact that the building was in the middle of a city. This confounds the flamability problem, if a dirigible caught on fire in New York burning pieces would rain down on the city causing many causalities. Those are the difficulties in allowing dirigibles to moor on the Empire State Building."
5,"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, nature, unsafe docking conditions and pre-existing laws against dirigibles were just a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". On the top of a building so high the wind is always switching directions which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"". Blimps or dirigibles always landed in open fields and could be weighted down with lead weights, but using this technique ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"". The builders of the Empire State Building also came across ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". Now this law made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical or legal."
5,"There were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles.  One of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it.  In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which use a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen.  Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day.  The largest obstacle they faced though was nature.  Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street.""  As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if.  The third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas.  Even as tall as the Empire State Building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast.  Al Smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety, nature, and state law."
5,"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether."
5,"On December 11, 1929 a man named Al Smith announced he was building the world's tallest building at 1,250 feet This building was the Empire state building in New York, that would be used for a dirigible mooring But, there would be a few obstacles to face, that would cause the dirigible mooring to not successfully be used.Al Smith announced he was building this mooring mast but did not announce potential obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would face when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the largest obstacles would be the wind factor, causing the dirigible's back end to sway. Another issue, would be having the foreign dirigibles full of flammable gases to be moored too close to a densely populated area. Also, before any dirigibles could be moored, constructors had to spend extra time and money to make the building much more sturdy, to hold the dirigibles."
5,"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to make it safe for civilians, but also ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (paragraph @NUM1) just by reading this quote from the excerpt you can tell that the modifications which cost a pretty penny. Over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that, at that time, these blimps were made of mostly hydrogen, which meant it was extremely flamable. @ORGANIZATION2 said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""
5,"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were very difficult. The builders had to modify and strengthen the building. The modifications were very expensive. ""Over sixty thousand dollars"". Another obstacle the builders faced were the winds on the top of the building. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around. Also, They faced the safety. Builders were affraid that a @CAPS1 would happen because the dirigibles refill of hydrogen is very flammable. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS2, Another reason was that the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it clear that the dock would never happen. Even though they were pretty high of the ground it was still effective. They couldnt even tied it up and secure it so it won't fall because it was still against the law This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the stress that would be added to the buildings frame. The stress would derive from the pressure of the wind pushing against the great weight of the dirigible, which would pull the cable attached to both the dirigible and building. In the text it says ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building that the modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Another obstacle that builders face was the safety of the citizens below. Most dirigibles were made of hydrogen. Since hydrogen is so flammable, they couldn't risk the safety of the @LOCATION1. It says in the text, ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The final obstacle was that it was illegal to attempt this. This outlawed airships flying too low over urban areas thus creating conflict. The obstacles that face the builders of the Empire State building destroyed all chances of dirigible being docked at this location."
5,"The builder's of Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first complication was the actual creation and reliability of the docking area. In paragraph nine it reads ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" The stress of both the dirigibles load and would pressure would need to distributed to the buildings foundation-nearly @NUM1 feet below. In order to do this the construction would require over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. There was also a law prohibit.As well as construction complications, there were many complications with the idea itself. Dirigibles were highly dangerous-filled with the very flammable gas hydrogen. This posed a problem as the docking site would be located above a dense urban population; if the dirigible were to ignite the damage would be unimaginable. Among many other circumstances, these are just a few examples of the complications faced with dirigibles"
5,"The docking of the Empire State Building might had been a great idea, but the obstacles of making that happen was far more than making it realistic. Not because it was impossible because it was to much work to accomplish. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomplish this new situation."" In the quote they talked about remodifying the building for it can be strong enough to dock and that would have taken a lot of work and; ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" There was another problem in making everything possable. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United State used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If hydrogen is flammable than that would cause serious problems of docking in a populated city. Even if they made everything possable there was still a law claiming that ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The dirigibles would not been able to fly close enough to dock The docking of the Empire State Building might had been a great idea but they couldn't make it possable."
5,"Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obsticles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire state building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. These obstacles included having to redesign and modify the building structure, the dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling winds, and state law. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM1) This was because the building was not originally built to have that capability. This meant, in order to do this meant over sixty thousand dollars in modification had to be spent. Another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a likely chance of catching fire, as displayed by the Hindenburg. If that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New @CAPS1 it would be a catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back the ship would swiveled around, and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2) This would just be dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law @CAPS2 aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This probably should have been considered. Overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there."
5,"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. First, the dirigibles were large, ""some were as long as one thousand feet"" which is eqivillant to @NUM1 blocks in New York City. There was a ""lack of suitable landing area."" It would be very difficult to have them get tied up to dock there. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1, that could potentially cause damage to the building. Most dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen which is highly flamable. This could be unsafe and cause @CAPS2 and fires. ""@CAPS2 can be dangerous in densley populated areas such as New York City."" One final obstacle, was just the nature. Like described in paragraph @NUM2, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" All these obstacles are why it was hard to dock dirigibles."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.One of the obstacles the builders faced was the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles that were supposed to land on the Empire State Building were made as long as one thousand feet, according to the text it was ""the same as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the obstacle of safety, because according to the excerpt ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" for New York City, this was just a recipe for destruction. The builders also faced the greatest obstacle of all, which was nature. The text tells us ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" this made it unsafe.In conclusion, these were the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock."
5,"The obstical's the builder's took on Were difficult, and time @CAPS1. In Way's Such as the onley benefit's the Empire State building relly passed Was being the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to @CAPS2 a dirigible's docking base for future transportation @CAPS3 filed to do @CAPS4 during certain law's and technicall difficulties. @CAPS4 obsticles such as adding extra body work to the building's structure was not even neccarasary.Those are the obsticle's the builder's faced and as well as @CAPS5 time and @CAPS6."
5,"The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."
5,"In this expert The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the narrator tells the story of how the architects of the Empire State Building wanted to build a mooring mast for dirigibles, but were not able to complete this project due to the many obstacles they face. The first obstacle was modifying the steel frame of the building to accommodate such a mast at the top. This, however, was overcome. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made"", but the architects accomplished it. One of the main reasons the mooring mast could not be affixed to the top of the Empire State Building was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is much more flammable than helium, causing the dirigible to be very unsafe. ""The German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey"". The owners of the Empire State Building realized that something of this nature happened in New York, the effects would be much worse. Another obstacle was nature itself. The constantly shifting winds atop the building would make it very difficult for dirigibles to tie up, not to mention once one was tied up, its back and would swing about ""high above pedestrians on the street,"" being ""neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there was an existing law against airships going too low over urban areas. Even if everything else worked out, it would be illegal for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. Although it was a good idea, there were too many obstacles to secure a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building."
5,"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations. Expectations including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac.With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated @CAPS1.Y.C. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas."
5,"The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers."
5,"New York is said to be, ""the city that never sleeps."" The people of New York are always awake, rushing about in the streets. When four-term governor, Al Smith, wanted  to put up a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, these people of New York had many concerns. Along with the people whom were constructing the building. These concerns consisted of laws, saftey and construction.If a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area. Another major worry was safety. These dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible had caught fire above New York City, the damage could be tragic. The construction of the mast was out of the question because they never had planned on making it prior to starting the projectOverall, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never really destined to have been created. Too many factors and obstacles were in the way after the idea of creating the mooring mast began."
5,"The obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were having a suitable landing area for such huge blimps said in paragraph six. The builders created a mast on top of the Empire State Building and believed it could support the dirigibles and safely allow the people aboard the blimps to safely get off. But this was not what happened because as stated in paragraph fourteen the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were violent and consulate changing, the blimp came down on the people of New York City there would be a terrible catastrophe, so was not practical or safe. Not being safe was just something that the American people did not want and the Empire @CAPS1 Building would never be used for dirigibles as the idea fated along in the 1930s as airplanes are ***as stated in paragraph @NUM1."
5,"There Are @CAPS1 things that Are worry Some About dirigibles docking there. One of them was the fact that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind As the passengers walked down A Gangplank"". This would be unsafe because As it sways, it could knock the passengers off the plank and cause them to fall."
5,"The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the @LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared""."
5,The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors . I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2.
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem would be ""nature itself."" In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""even if the dirigible were tethered to mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around & around the mooring mast because winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This shows that because of high winds up in the building it would be difficult for a dirigible to stay stable on a mooring mast creating issues. A second obstacle would be the way that most dirigibles from outside @LOCATION3 are made up of. In paragraph @NUM2 it mentions that ""most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen & hydrogen is highly flammable"" considering the fire accident of ""German dirigible Hindenburg in Lakehurst, @CAPS1."" ""Owners of the Empire Building realized how worse the accident could've been if it happened in New York City."" This shows because of the way foreign dirigibles are made up docking them on the Empire Building can have a big outcome. Lastly, a last obstacle was a law against dirigibles. It mentions that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up with building or approach the area."" This is showing that because of this law it would be useless for allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire Building. The obstacles Empire State Building builders faced wasn't easy at all."
5,"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building @CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles."
5,"Dirigibles were the least lasting transportation means invented by people, they moved quickly for the time but were dangourous to use effeciently. So attemting to moor one to the top of a windy, pointy tower was not a very good idea. The first (and biggest) problem of the idea was how the violent wind could easily blow the dirigibles into a building or point, the idea putting weights on it was good while docking on the ground but you could not dangle heavy weights above a crowded urban area, ruling that out. Another yet eqaully as difficult obsticle was the city law that stated that you could not fly dirigibles over cities due to their tendency to combust."
5,"Allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the empire State Building created some obstacles for the builders. For one, they couldn't just put a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, because that would cause too much stress on the framework's foundation. Another reason was safety. A lot of the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which makes it highly flammable. And, after the German Hindenburg was destroyed, the @LOCATION2 realized how dangerous it would be over New York. Another reason is nature. There was violent air currents that caused different wind patterns. And, as it said in @CAPS1 @NUM1, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. These obstacles caused this landing dock to not be created."
5,"The builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to loose controll and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below."
5,"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped."
5,"When the workers were constructing the Empire State Building, they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there which forced numerous problems. First of all, safety was a huge concern and most dirigibles outside @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium which is highly flammable and can cause disastrous fires. Second, according to paragraph @NUM1, the winds on the top of the building were shifting and had violent air currents. This is a big conflict if you're trying to let off passengers off on a tall building when the winds keep shifting. Finally, back then, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. You can't break the U. S. laws and you definitely can't over and over-populated city like New York. As we all know, the government was smart enough and just dropped the entire idea of letting dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building because of the problems it was bringing up."
5,"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal. Today, it is nothing more but decoration."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. As stated, modifications had to be made to the building's framework strengthen and accommodate the new situation. Another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were consulate shifting due to violent air currents."" This would leave the dirigibles swiveling any air above pedestrians which was neither practical or safe. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during the project which unfortunately led to the known fact that the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its purpose."
5,"In the excerpt, it talks about making the empire state building the tallest in new york. It was the tallest building until archetectures built the chrysler building. The chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna loose his tittle for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst."
5,"Construction always has challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the obstacles the builders faced included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the frame would need to be modified, the cost, and nature itself.landing the dirigibles would be a hard task. For one, the dirigibles are enormous, they are ""a thousand-foot"" long flying devices. This would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its weight. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way  to the building's foundation."" This is a struggle because the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified."" This modification would take lots of effort and planning. Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is mindblowing and would create challenges of how to get that money. In addition nature itself was an obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the buildings frameworks just to support the dirigibles weight. They realized that dirigibles ran on hydrogen and wouldn't be able to land on top of the building because hydrogen was highly flammable and it was too risky. It wasn't practical or safe to have dirigibles land on the top of the building because the very high and violent winds could knock it out of place. They could've been knocked out of place and fallen on hundreds of pedestrians. After all, there was a law that said that dirigibles could not fly too low over urban areas. So many obstacles kept them from allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."
5,"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders had to overcome a couple of obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One obsticle they had to overcome was the wind currents. In paragraph @NUM1 the author wrote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The stress from the dirigible was another obsticle. In paragraph @NUM2 the author writes ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" If there is too much stress to a buildings frame, the building will collapse. The last obstacle the builders faced was it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM3 the author talks about how there was a law for any flying airships on Flying to low over urban areas. The builders in the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 had three obsticles to overcome while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city! The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, The greatest Obstacle was just nature itself."
6,"@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is a huge past of life to be ?? While you have problems and obstacles that makes you a good person. To have @CAPS1 it ??? to ???  to get the job done that has a long process you might have to wait for an example I have to have @CAPS1 all the time. for like football, hockey and all the active things I do you have to have @CAPS1. As you know adults probably have any more @CAPS1 than teenagers like myself.  like if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day! Like he does it never does happen. Now when I become more grown up and an adult Iâll hopefully have way more @CAPS1 and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also do have to say Iâm getting better with @CAPS1, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about @CAPS1, @CAPS2 hopefully when Iâm an grown adult Iâll be able to have some good @CAPS1 like my dad."
6,A time when I had to be patient was when I had to ?? my little brothers and my two cousins. This was going to take a lot of patience. One day I got a phone call from my aunt. She said  she needed a ???  sitter for my two year old and seven year old  cousins. she said she would pay me if I would ?? them. So I said sure. I hut n I did ?? I was getting myself into. A couple days were my mom ???(@CAPS1) @CAPS2 turned out piclity good for me after all.
6,Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. Ive been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.
6,"@CAPS1 are we there yet? I keep asking over and over again. @CAPS2 but almost, he replied. Today we are going to @LOCATION1 adventures and I am so excited! After I asked my @CAPS1 when we would be there, about @NUM1 minutes later we finally arrived at @LOCATION1 adventures! The line  to get are tickets was long but not to long. Once we get them we went to go look for a lock to put all of are stuff in! The line far that wasnt long so we did that fast! We were now all hungry, so we went to go eat! The time we got into the restaurant, the lines to order were very long! Ok, so now that we are all done eating, it was time to ride some awesome e rides! @CAPS3, man! is what I would get saying when the lines to the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, ok say I had to go change my clothes to go into the water park and change back or go to the restroom man these lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost done, and the park will be closing, my family and I arent into the gift shop: we were in the for about @NUM1 minutes waking around. When we were done and we were ready to check out, the check out line wasnt long at all! Finally, there was a line that wasnt long! All that day I was a very patient girl! Between everything that went on throughout that day!"
6,"If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1s @CAPS1, thats a different story. Ill tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldnt be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldnt get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didnt help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if Im very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait."
6,"My name is @PERSON1,@PERSON2 @CAPS1 going to talk about patien. More than once I was patient. @CAPS2 example I was patient when the teacher is talking or paying a bill. Once in my hole life I was patient @CAPS2 hours and hours because I was at the store when I come in the store there was not a lot of people @CAPS2 a waly the place was so much people in it so I brate my staff when I was walking to price chack to leave people where running in front of me.So it took me more then @NUM1 hours.

6,"A time when I was patient. Was when I went to the book story and I woned a book. I was at the book store and I wanted a book called tayler swift back at the @LOCATION1 as a school girl and my mom said if you are patient then yes, and I was so happy because she know I love tayler swift book and her life. As soon as I got it I stared reading it. My mom said thank you for being patient I was you welcome I said thank you for buying it. I have told my mom that if we could go to the book store and she said not today and I keep on asking and she said not and I keep on asking and she said maybe. So I was and the car listen to radio and we when to the mall and there was a book store in the mall and I ask if I could look around and my mom said yes and she said find the bok that you wonted I find it and she bote it. This is a time I was patient. One thing I learn is to be patient if you want something and dont keep asking."

6,"Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldnt sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais, hi! very excitedly. Now am glad that I stayed patient."

So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, ok, everyone back in the pool. I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasnt worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe."

While I was in line I started talking to my friends we played games and walked a few steps up every a minutes. I sat there and walked up with my mom and sat down again and it was just seemed like the line wasnt moving at all! Finally we got up to the front and me and my friends were so excited.

And I said I play winner @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON2 won and @PERSON1 didnt give me the controller and she wasnt sharing. @CAPS1 then I said she could play one more time then its my turn, instead she played four more times @CAPS1 I said @PERSON1 its my turn you played and I didnt, she said it is not your turn. @CAPS1 then her mom said @PERSON1 you can play @NUM1 more minutes then its @CAPS2s turn one hour thirty minutes past and she still didnt give it to me @CAPS1 then I said @PERSON1 its my turn, and Ive been patient for a long time you either give it to me or Im going to take it, she still didnt it to me.

6,"Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isnt just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when your waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience."
6,This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a wii and no one would buy me one. So I saved up my money for so long. Then I had to wait what felt like weeks was @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days. That just made it feel longer. So I desided to tell my self I didnt want it so I wasnt anxious to get it. That kind of worked. But when I got it to tell you the truth it isnt as fun as I thought it would be.
6,"There are many time @CAPS1 a persons life when someone was being patient. Patient @CAPS1 a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There @CAPS1 a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful. Like I said, being patient @CAPS1 a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it."
6,"One time I was patient was when I was standing in a line at the petting zoo. The animal I was waiting in line to see, was a donkey. It was a hot @DATE1 day around three in the afternoon of course a donkey was the crowds favorite animal. There only a couple people observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was around the middle of the line. I was getting tired but I had see to this donkey! I was being very patient waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally only a couple people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey. A couple minutes passed old I was petting the donkey: @CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo, happy. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a bat on the back."

6,"In the year @DATE1 I lend my mom some money. I gave my @NUM1. She said that she will give it back. So i was being patient . So i was waiting and wainting and while I was waiting I thought she forgot. So i reminded her and  it turns out that she really did forget to give it to me. She told me she will pay me back, and then she told me you want go on the field trip dont you so she gave the money to my teacher so I could go on the field trip.  And finally she gave the money back.  And I said blessings really do come back. Patience is a good thing because @CAPS1 gives the blessings back to you. I had @DATE2 and I gave it to my friend and he said he will pay me back so I was being patient and waiting for the blessings to come back. So then I gave another one of my friends @NUM2 also. So I was waiting to get my blessings back. I was being patient and patient. I was being so patient @CAPS1 blessed me back with allowance. And I waited and waited and finally until I get my money back.With that allowance that @CAPS1 gave  to me I bought my mom, my brother and sister something to eat and then that blessing came back to me.

I had want to school with my mom so she can take a test @CAPS4 drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting I was texting and on the internet, @CAPS4 my stomach started to rumble, I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I can get something to eat as I was texting I stopped and thought about what was I about to do. I knew @CAPS5 hard long she had studied for that test. I didn`t want her to get a bad grade so I just sat there. I texted people. People called me so my mind was off food. After my mom finished her test she came out the room. I asked her @CAPS5 did it go? she looked at me smiled and said I felt confident, but know @CAPS1 hungry I shouted out me to we got in the car and went to subway. I had got the forest now meal. With cooking, chips, and a drink it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. @CAPS4 we went @ORGANIZATION1, charlete, @CAPS7, @PERSON1 and others places as well. After I thought about it I never want to do that again. I was starting and my but started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing to do never again will I do that. At least I had bounding rime with my mom. Thats one bright side."
6,"This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went off I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say usher tickets on sell that and then I frozzes to listen, the tickets were going on sell down town. I told my mom and she rushed in the car and got dozen there so fast you wouldnt even see us leave. When I got to the line it was so long it seem like it go on forever. I waited and waited it felt like it only moved on an inch. Ti waited and still waited I beagin to get mad but I stood in line. Which my long wait was over I begain to jump for joy. As I walked to the concer she said sorry we are all sold out. I couldnt believe it I begain to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing it was so unfair. And thats the time I was patient for noting."
6,One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming  out. I asked my dad @CAPS1 we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until @CAPS2. So I waited until @CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents @CAPS4 and & me my brother went to play it.
6,"Finally , the day was here! The new roller coaster @CAPS4 michoggs  adventure we open! ?? couldnt wait! Only one thing stand in my way to go on the ride, the drive.

6,"its where?  The woman asked for the third time. @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms, I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didnt say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often dont meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  @CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of youngs incorporated.  @CAPS3, youre with youngs?  @CAPS4 asked.   Do you know where the show room is?  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.  I said in a robotic voice.  @CAPS6t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  @CAPS8, sir.  @CAPS9 old are you?  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  @CAPS11, sir. I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. Are you getting paid?  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  yes,  sir.  But its @CAPS12 a lot.  Its more like volunteer work,  really.  @CAPS13 dont ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  thanks son. Youre welcome.  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think well both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dads shop, because if @CAPS4 didnt, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient."
6,"@CAPS1  @CAPS1 are or there yet? @CAPS3 groaned Do, now have come patence @CAPS1 replied. @CAPS3 is my little @NUM1 year old sister.

6,A time I was patient was when I was going on the raptor at cedar point. There was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored. There was some music but that didnt really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it. One hour dragged by. Then finally ten more minutes wait till I got to go on the raptor it was the best ride ever.
6,A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch. That the time when I was patient over something.

The teacher says when the @ORGANIZATION1."
6,"Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you dont have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didnt want to wait so she didnt look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldnt really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So thats what happens when you dont have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so thats my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences."
6,Pacience is a talent that is difficult to master. Pacience is a mental game. Pacience comes in everyones life. If you have no pacience then therefore you have more anger. Pacience for those minors stuck in a mine for two months. College takes a seal of years. Pacience is required there also. Pacience is among people everywhere whether its waiting for a toy or waiting for god  to save your pacience is something that will stay here forever.

Things were great until they left .My brother was in preschool at the time @CAPS2 they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and I had to help him. @CAPS2 I thought ok this will be easy, @CAPS2 i had him read the book and my mom told me that he knows the words @CAPS2 i wont have to sound out every single one, I had  to he wouldnt  do the work and the baby wouldnt quit crying and the dog wouldnt stop barking (he hate when babys cry) and the house was crazy! @CAPS2 i started to panic.

And I didnt what to ruin my mom plans and i definetly wanted to prove her wrong. @CAPS2 i calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said he told me to be patient. @CAPS2 i let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First  i read the book aloud it got both of their attention .then i  told  andi made a game out of doing the work and it was all good .Then  @CAPS4  time came @CAPS2 i made some food that we all liked and set the baby in his high chair with  his food and  gave my brother his plate i turned around and he  trowed  his plate at me  and food was everywhere! I got mad and told myself be patient, i cleaned up the mess and feed the kids and put in a movie and they all feel a sleep! I quietly, cleand up the house and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised i did it. Patence is a big part in life if you loose your temper it just makes things worse."

6,"Patience, can you be patient? Some people are and some are and some  are not. Some time  I can not. Well hear is a story about patience. One time at school in the lunch line, it was long. It would bearl  move. I wanted lunch so bad I was not being patient. But for some resson my friend was being patient. I said to her why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to  get something to eat. I said yeah that is true. So I tryed to be patient and before I know it I was siting by my friends  talking and eating my food."
6,"When your at a store or the doctor or anywhere where you have wait for something you always have to have patience or you wiil never be able to do anything. I remember when i was at the store with my mom we had to wait in this long  line just to buy a few groceries but if didnt  have patience we would put are stuff back and went back home but sense we did  have patience we got to buy are stuff. That why, if you dont have you wont be able to do anything you wanna do."
6,"One time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to come in the mail. They so, dit would only take @NUM1 ??? days so, I said ok thats not to so days flew by and hats were supposed to come in the mail that day so when us truck came by I was so exited but there was a box for my mom.@CAPS1. I said I was really, so planted but I thought to myself they i.e. come tomorrow and??? the didnt come so I as stil patient but close to not being two more days past so I just gave up then one day when I got home from my friends house they were there yes, finally all my patients payed off and thats the time I had patients."
6,"In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you dont be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didnt get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience. Thy choice of patience is you have to be patience and wait your turn to go.  The whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life."
6,"Today I will be writing about patience. Patience is also a factor that is part of your personality. When someone is patient, they will just sit quietly when waiting, oposed to an impatient person that will whine and complain while waiting. I myself am not the most patient person. Any wait over @NUM1 min. will have me jumping of the walls and complaining. Being impatient is a flaw of character, but does not mean Im a bad person. Unlike me, my cousin, @PERSON1, is a very patient person that will sit and wait never see her complaining, or even getting very restless I personally dont know how she sits still so long! In closing, patience is simply being able to sit still when need be for as long as needed."
6,"Patience is a good thing to learn how to do. Its a good thing to have patiecents because if you want some body to do something for you and they are doing something else thats important how you might distract them and it might mess up what theyre doing so they might get mad and not do the thing you wanted them to do earlier. Its respectful to have paiecents one reason is the first paragraph. Or if you get mad and start yelling they probably wont do it eather.  Here are some ways you have to have paiecents, doctors, court, important phone calls/ buisnese complain eather. When you get patiecent you probably would hear, yelling/ screaming, kids having fits, kicking, hitting, and even cring. Impatience is bad because youll get upset and put alot of unnesissary stress on your self. Patiecents has its pros and cons but you will always want to be patient instead of unpatiecent."
6,"Im always having to be patient. Its because I have an older brother that doesnt do what he is told. Lets say my dad tells him to clean the bath room, well it takes him ten minuts to get up, then I have to go when hes cleaning and he wont let me. So Im thats one of the reasons. Another is my older sister shes always on the phone so I barely ever get to use it. So I wait until my parents get home so they yell at he to get off, thats why Im very patient."
6,"A time when I was patient is when I play volleyball. Im patient when I play volleyball because when you dont score points, you dont get to serve. One game we werent doing so well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand was doing great. Everybody got to serve except me on that maten. In the end our team ended up winning  I never complained one time about not being able to serve. Every body cheered and chanted because won by two points."
6,"Are the here yet? I said as I pased back and forth. Patience, it takes a while to get from the locker from all the way down here, said @CAPS1 @CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera! @CAPS3 got him! said @PERSON1 @CAPS4s right behind us. @CAPS5 funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swearI ll @CAPS6 off the camera! yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 atempted to grab his clothes and missed. @CAPS8! My patience has run out @CAPS7! I said taking another picture @CAPS10 I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet. I continued @CAPS11! You can @CAPS5 put this on the internet! so your going to stop picking on us? I asked @CAPS8! @CAPS4 said , @CAPS13, then Ill just zoom in right here. @CAPS13! @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. So to show the little respect @CAPS3 had for him, @CAPS3 gave hime his clothes, turned around, and walked away."
6,"One day I was going to the dentist because I had to get my retaners. So my mom drove me there. When we got there I went to go check in. After I checked in I sat in a chair and waited and waited then finally the person came out. But it wasnt for me it was for my mom. So I grabed  @CAPS1 and started reading. when I was half way in the @CAPS1 the lady came out and yelled my name. I got my retaners,my mom got done before me so she checked out. That is the day I was patient."
6,"Someone was in line for hot & ready pizza since they are hot and ready, a lot of people were in line and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza is supposed to hot and ready. Everybody was throwing tanruns. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching them doing tanrums. The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was lewing. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza. The little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults. They were all whining and everybody said they don`t want to hear you so you had to shut up. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut. He didn`t bother to speak. Everybody were back to normal and everybody had smile on their faces and even the little kids everybody got their pizza really fast.  Always be patient."
6,"Well, one day I saw a commercial on the awesome xbox @NUM1. The commercial said it would be out in @NUM2 weeks. @NUM2 weeks I thought well thats going to take forever so I waited and waited and waited. I glamced at the clock. It said @NUM4, I said, @CAPS1 only been @NUM5 minutes. So I started to play a game and I forgot about the xbox @NUM1. My dad said that we were going shopping to get my x-box. Im like, wow did it fly by. I guess if you dont think about it and be patient it will be over in no time."
6,"I am patient every year @CAPS1 one specil day to come. My birthday ??? ??? @NUM1 was a specil day @CAPS1 my mom and dad, @NUM2 boy my mom ever had @NUM3 boy my dad had. I am still wating @CAPS1 my brithday to come again."
6,"@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon dont worry, @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaing. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called @CAPS3 person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didnt come in the mail. Ive been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didnt. Ive been sitting here since ten oclock where is the @CAPS4 track! I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! @CAPS5 coming I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7  truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 thats it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps. @CAPS10! I sob in agony,  why does this feeling consume me like this? I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it.  @CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here! I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally!"
6,"Being patient is very important. Once time my mom told me I was getting a new phone. She showed me what it looked like line on the computer. It was a touch screen: I was so excited: I had to wait days and days for it. It took a lot of patience. Finally one day my mom brought it to me at my dads home! She showed me how to work it, I could download music on it play games and more! I was so proud of all of them days waiting paid off and I got a new phone!"
6,I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!
6,"I am not a patience person, like I cant sit in a sit for more than five minutes, but there was one time I was patience and i bet very alse was to that right riding a bike where out training wheels. When I was five learned how to ride a bike I just keeped falling of at one piont my bike  flip and I allmost broke my jaw but i didnt. Finally after @NUM1 weeks of onstint falling I rode for @NUM2 minutes without falling and finally learn how to riken a bike."
6,"I cannot wait any longer! blurted @PERSON1. @CAPS1 will be out in a second gosh! I explained. This was the day that my friend @PERSON1 and I decided to ride our bikes over to our friend @PERSON2s house. @PERSON1 wasnt patient at all unlike me. The sun smiled down on @ORGANIZATION1. My friend @PERSON1 and I were hanging out with each other all day. I am so bored moaned @PERSON1. @CAPS2 what do you want to do? Anything sounds good at this point. I questioned. She suggested @CAPS4 go for a walk and I blurted out anything but that! @CAPS4 sat in that quiet grassy field for about fifteen minutes, just thinking. @CAPS3, how about @CAPS4 go to @PERSON2s? I blurted out. ugh fine, lets go. @CAPS4 took our rusty bikes and peddled over to @PERSON2s house, and knocked on his big, red, door. There stood @PERSON2, small and thin, clean long brown hair, freckles all over his face, and a cheesey grin to top it off. @CAPS4 asked if @CAPS1 wanted to come outside, and hang out. Ill be out in a couple minutes @CAPS1 replied. @CAPS4 tumbled down the stairs and set in his yard. About four minutes later, @PERSON1 starts asking tons of questions, but one specific one when is @CAPS1 gonna get out here?! I do not know! I yelled. I am not god! @CAPS5, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning she exhaled. Now it has been about twenty minutes since @CAPS1 had been inside. @PERSON1 was loosing it, I was perfectly fine. She ran up the stairs and knocked on the door like she was big, bad, wolf. @PERSON2 opened the door with one hand, and had a sand witch in the other. your eating! she screamed. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 replied I was starving oh my gosh I have been waiting forever! she yelled. @PERSON2 shuts the door and gets a glass of lemonade. Only patient people get some as @CAPS1 handed me a glass. I started laughing, I am so glad I was patient!"
6,"The time that I was patient was today when everyone was takeing the @CAPS1.E.A.P. when we all get into the classroom nobody what so ever did not want to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P, when our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, nobody wanted to. So when we got the  paket that we had to bubble in our answers we had to fill something out on the front of the paket. Then we had to put our first and last name on it befour we could take a break. When the break was over we needed to get a n free reading book and our teacher had to read all of us the directions to us we ,got started and when everyone was finished she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break, when everyone went she read the directions to the other part and when everyone was doing that same people got done really early and they got really board and they didnt want to read so then they all started to talk she would be right back that she had to go to the bathroom so once someone to came in and would wach us then all of the guys would make paper basket balls and started to shot them into into the tiny basket ball hoope and then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we  would be starting the last writing sesson and that after this it would be lunch and it might even go though or lunch and then everyone was  freaking out. So that was the time that I was just patient."
6,"Time my friend was patient! one day it was @DATE1@NUM1.and that day was when report cards came out. My grades were good I had @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1, was failing. maths, she had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom see,s it she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tryed to cross it out and put an good grade but she knew her mom will find out. so she told her mom report cards didnt come out yet. And her mom believed her. So then she tried re printing it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and I told her my honest thought and I said @CAPS2. but if you dant wanna get in trouble then yeah And she said. When her mom asked her did the report cards come out. She said yeah then her mom found out its not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and  it was a fake grade. Then she got introuble and she was patient about it and she said the truth. Her mom went to the  office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she said the truth. Thats a time were my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade.She still was honest, and patient about it. I know that it was wrong for me two tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wont get in trouble."
6,"Havening a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know some one who does well thats exacually what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always woundered about her there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldnt wait but you know what she had patience. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasnt like other children, couldnt wait and always bother her parents she just sat patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2s too. She couldnt wait to leave but you know what got her, patience in the store and get that pacific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted it was just lips glass five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home she was so tired and she went up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait, thats how accedents and problems happen and this little girl got every thing she wanted one thing, she had patience."
6,"Are we there yet, I incurred my dad. @CAPS1 were hean, repied my dad. This is how most hunting trips went. We slovly trudged to our blind and waited, @CAPS2 on weres the deer, I questioned my dad. @CAPS3 wait and theyll @CAPS2 repied my dad. Thats when I learned to be patient. That trip meant a big deer."
6,"As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as Im older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I dont care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and dont want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and dont say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help."
6,"''@CAPS1, can I have a dartboard for @CAPS2?"" I asked. It was @DATE1, and that meant @CAPS2 was @CAPS4 around the corner.  ''I 'm busy now. I'll think about it."" my @CAPS1 replied. She was always busy with her job. I knew that she wasn't trying to ignore me, so I decided to be patient. ''@CAPS5.'' I replied as I left the room. In the past, I have never got anything I wanted whenever I asked too many times. I've learned to be patient. I was really hoping to get a dartboard, so I waited. It was @CAPS2 eve, and I was still looking for a dartboard. After dinner, we started sharing presents with my relatives. I looked through all the presents with my name on it and to my bitter dissapointment, there was not a single package that felt like a dartboard. I was very sad, and when I asked my @CAPS1, she @CAPS4 said that she was busy again. I was almost at the point of crying, but I sucked it up and left. It was @DATE2, and still no dartboard. I still wanted one, but I knew my @CAPS1 didn't have the time. Weeks passed by, and the faint hope of getting a dartboard was still there.  During the month of @DATE3, my @CAPS1 came into my room and from behind her she pulled out a present. ''@CAPS8 it's late. I saved up money to buy the electronic one."" my @CAPS1 said. I threw my hands up in the air and hugged her. I tore the wrapping paper open and sure enough, inside was a electronic dartboard. It was top notch too. So I finally understood why it took so long. It must've been hard for her to save up so much money.  ''@CAPS9 you!! ''I shouted as I hugged her again. That was perhaps the best present of my life. I was patient, and in the end it paid off. I play on my dartboard every day. This is one time that I was patient, and I'll never forget it."
6,When I was at a shop I found my friend from @LOCATION1 and start to talk to me about patient  and hi start to talk to me about that and I tol  to hem that I didn't know what is that main and we start to explain to me what was that and how start to produced. Then he tld me a story about that and I was learning  about the story.
6,"Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the aliens. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesnt cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that @CAPS1 are proof of aliens. @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isnt true he will defend you. He says, its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons. In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself."
6,"Have you ever had a time when you was patient and was waiting so long to get to do or have what you want or want to say? I know I have. There ways a time when I wanted to get new soccer shoes because my old soccer shoes was tearing up. So I went up and asked my mother and see is she would buy soccer new soccer shoes. But the answer she gave was wait for her next pay check. So I waited and waited for her next pay check. Then when she received the pay check for work. I asked her again and she told me that she had to pay the bills and so she told me to wait for the next pay check. So I replied ok nicely to her and just waited for the next one. Then @DATE1 I was share that she had gotten the next pay check. But my mom used up that pay check from work for new tires for the car. I was mad that she did that. But I had to be patient and wait and see if the following pay check was all for me to buy new soccer shoes. So the following @DATE1 @DATE1 I went up and beg my mom for some new soccer shoes. Then she said yup and took me to @ORGANIZATION1 and I bought a pair of red nike soccer deats. I was happy that I had some new pair of soccer shoes, and also I was happy that I was patient for it. That was the time I was patient. So now I want to hear if you were ever patient for something."
6,"I time that I had patience is when my fammle wint to @CAPS1 avencher and @CAPS2 are inline to go on shiver me timbers the bigest coster at park. @CAPS2 are in line , I said to a kid that had cut in front of my friend @PERSON1 and I as @CAPS2 wint up the ramp to get on the ride.

6,"A time when I was patient was this month when I was working on the haunted house with my friends from @NUM1-@CAPS1 club for the @NUM1-@CAPS1 @CAPS3 theme. Alot of the kids wanted to hurry up and get it finished for the competition, including me, but we were patient and took our time so it would turn out perfect and just the way we wanted it to. On our free time we went to all the other haunted houses to see how the other clubs were doing. Alot of them were really good, but some were ok because they were rushing things. And trying to be the first ones done. In one of the haunted houses, there was a ghost that was hangin from the roof, but it kept tipping over because they didnt tie it like their suppose to, eventually it fell off the roof. So we were about done with our house, but there was something missing? I said to myself? @CAPS4 would make it scarier? I know @CAPS4 we can do, I yelled out. Everyone looked at me waiting to say wat I had to say, @CAPS4 we could do is find a way to where it makes it look like theres something flying around the house dropping things on people. Everyone smiled and said we could give it a try. so we did alot of different things trying to make it work, finally we found a way and completed it. The next night we were ready for the competition. @CAPS5 time  said the leader. People started coming in. there was so much screaming and laughing. One of the leaders of the show bored layed on the ground yelling help ahhhh we laughed at her and helped her up. Everyone made their votes for the best, and scariest haunted house. We were waiting patiently, while we ate a snack, while other clubs were going crazy and getting mad, waiting for the show board to announce the winner. Finally they announced the winner. The winner of the best and scariest haunted house of the @NUM1-@CAPS1 haunted house theme goes to the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. @CAPS9 is my club. Other clubs were asking how we did it so good, and all we told them was we were patient, and took out time."
6,"Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @DATE1 and my mom woked me up at @NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didnt know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum Im ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life."
6,"@CAPS9 was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was awake waiting for @NUM1 o clock in the @TIME1 to come. The clock going by @CAPS3-@CAPS4-@CAPS3-@CAPS4! I was anticipating @CAPS10 @CAPS7 get for @CAPS1. I looked at the clock @CAPS9 said @NUM2 in the @TIME1. I decided to get up and do something to pass the time. I start playing video games and get bored of them, I try reading I don't feel like @CAPS9 I thought why don't I sneak a peek at the presents so I go down stairs. When I see them theyre amazing all glittery with wrapping paper I just would to open one. I count them I have @NUM3 present in all. maybe @CAPS9 I just open @NUM4 they want notice I pick out the smallest one. I begin to tear the paper then my mom comes out or her room and say ""@CAPS10 are you doing""?"""
6,"Let me get one thing straight Im not patient. I mean, I can be at times but. Mostly Im not. If here is something coming up @CAPS1 my birthday, I will not stop taking or thinking about it. By not being patient I just mean I cant wait. Most of the time @CAPS1 when we are going to a boreing family house, I can wait."
6,Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldnt think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.
6,A time I was patient was when I went fishing with my dad. I was patient because I waited about @NUM1 and caught a bass. Another time I was patient was when I was hunting with my rere gun. I waited about @NUM2 min and then I saw a chipmunk on the edge of a branch. It was just sitting there like a statue. It was staying so still it was hard for me to see it. Then I took the shot and baam I got it. That was my reward for being patient.
6,"I've been patient @CAPS2. I have been patient with little brother. He was asking me all of these questions I didn't know about. So, I kept saying, ""I don't know."" @CAPS1 he would asked me ""why?"" @CAPS2 I knew @CAPS3 he had asked me about @NUM1 questions. I got really frustrated with him, and tried to be patient. I would take a deep breath and @CAPS1 tell him that I didn't know the answers so maybe you should ask mom or dad. He didn't .He just kept repeating the same questions over and over again. Eventually I got so mad I was about to burst. But, I just kept saying to myself,"" be patient. ""he's is just little, be patient he's just little .""@CAPS3 worked! I held in my anger and was patient with him the whole time. I was proud of myself because, @CAPS3 got very frustrating, but I knew I could do @CAPS3. I knew that if I took some deep breaths and held in my anger and urge, to yell and scream at him. that I could do @CAPS3. And well guess what, I did!"
6,"Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didnt panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners."
6,"We had been patient enough on the plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient checking in. now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, then dissappered. We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. after an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away. We wait until weve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food."
6,"One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!"
6,"@PERSON1 was never patience, which got her in trouble. She always got her way, and always complained. She was like a princess, a snotty priencess at the most. @PERSON1 was always getting her just because she couldnât wait for anything .When  @PERSON1 pinnally got her own car, she took it for a spin. When the light turned yellow she drove as past as a chechah to make the light. @PERSON1 was always lucky, because there were no cops around. @PERSON1 couldnât find where to go , so she drove to the shore and parked the car and fan to the door as it she was racing some one inportian. She scaned the lanes looking foor something to eat. @PERSON1 was eager to find food. Finnelly she found something cold and delilishes. Ice cream as @PERSON1 snatched up the ice cream she walked to the check out lane. @PERSON1 throught sence the line was so long, she could just walk out and pay next time she was there. As @PERSON1 walked out the door. When she walked out, a loud annoying alarm went off. It righten @PERSON1 because the alarm was loud. She walked back in and opened the ice cream. People walking around @PERSON1 thought she was looney others thought that she was acting like a child. A man walked up to her and asked for the recipe, but @PERSON1 was confused @CAPS1 the mistake that @PERSON1 made, she was always patience and never was on patience and stale again!"
6,"On @DATE1 I went to the doctors I went and there had to be at least @NUM1 people there already so we get there at @NUM2 @CAPS1 theres a tv that has sports center and @CAPS2 a while @CAPS7 gets boring so I watched sports center for about an hour so now @CAPS7 was noon I ask my mom When are they going to call me @CAPS3 then my mom said I dont know Ill go ask they say theres only one ahead of me turns out there was like @NUM3 ahead of me, they said only one ahead of me for the doctor I was going to see. So finally around @NUM4 I got called @CAPS3 then we waited @CAPS3 there for an hour so finally around @NUM5 I got to see a doctor and he check out my knee he didnt know what was wrong so he got the surgen in and he told me I have a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 then we finally got out of there at @NUM6 I told my mom @CAPS7s about time we got out of there and I have to get surgery on @DATE2 and well I dont know what happens next I didnt have surgery yet."
6,A time when I was patient is when my aunt neck was hurting very very badly. So my mom and I went over there to take her to a hosipatial when we get there I had walked her in it was crowded my aunt and I sat down and walked for my mom to come in. My mom came in and my aunt had went to see what was wrong with her she had wet to the back room with the doctor my mom and I sat there and asked what was going on the lobe. There was a lot of people and there there was I liked women and her action I think and there was a little by have a timper tandrams I was mad because it was taking forever but I had to be patient so I couple of hour go pass and she is still not out yet so I asked my mom can I walk on the other side to see what they are watching she said yes. II walked over there and they were watching the same thing. My mom told me to come hear so we can she what is wrong with my aunt so we went back there to see what was happening and she was in a bed laying down she told my mom something but I did not hear it I said so can we leave now she said know we have to wait to the doctor come back with my papper final the doctor came and asked left I was kind of patient but not all the way thought we got home around @NUM1 and I had stayed with my aunt because she was hurt and that was it.
6,"I have been patient before, but I want to tell about the time I was patient at the fair. Fair week is always long. I take two horses, rabbits, and turkeys. I am going to tell about my turkeys. Last year at the fair I look two toms, they weighed over @NUM1 lbs each. I got first plane in my heavy weight class with them. Then I got to go in the grand champion class. My turkeys lost their tempure but tried to be patients I lost place in that class, I wasnt happy. This year I got reserve grand champion with turkeys. I also got first place again in the heavy weight class. My mom told me I was more patient then I was last year. My turkeys weighed exactly the same as they did last year. I was really happy about my turkeys. Next year I am going to try to get grand champion. All I have to do is be patient."
6,"Last @DATE1, while I was up at my families within my seep dad, taught my brothers, friends and I how to wares. It being the dareful am not really, I tied first. Using all the steps my step dad told me to, and being patient with myself, I got prepared in the water. Out of the blue [literally, we were on a lake] I got up on my skills just like @CAPS1! No I could make all! In when the water level end came around and I brought my boat up to the cabin. I insisted her to cry water at ring. But when we got out to the lake, and I had skilled a few times in a lowest was up to here to decide if she was going to try skilling for sure. We sat there for what seems hill an hour waiting for her decision. But, in the end she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didnt try to persuade was of pitch him into trying it. I was very patience with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I will not proud of myself to this day, for what I did on that boat."
6,One day when I was patient in was at the market and me and my mom got a lot of food.We had to stand in line.When we was neyt and it had to put the food on the moving thing by  my self.And I had to take it to the car and put it in the car and take it ot the car  into the house.I couldnt unit to watch tv.
6,"Someone I know that was very patient was my friend @PERSON1. He was patient when @PERSON2 my friend and me were riding on a four-wheeler. It was my turn to get on so @PERSON1 had to wait, we said we are only leaving for five minutes, so he said thats ok. When we started to go, we got carried away and lost track of the time. When we went back to @PERSON1s house we thought he was going to get mad of us but instead he said about time you guys came back, I was waiting here for twenty minutes. @CAPS1 when @PERSON1 got his turn @PERSON2 had to leave to his house because it was getting late. When @PERSON2 left, @PERSON1 had told me, dont leave me waiting there for that long ok. Since that day we havent left him for that long ever again."
6,"The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom dont have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you dont have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses!"
6,My friend an I were wateng to go no a new ride at @CAPS1 font. The ride was cold shoateng the cat. Is it was a water ride we wated. Over @NUM1 hours to go on if it. Was bouring after that we went on. The cowrcscrowe it was fun.
6,"It was show day for dairy and I show dairy, I was excited. But my mom said we had to go to the larndray mat first. When we got I decied to cheack the time it would be enough time to get to show on time because it stared at @NUM1. I would hear the washers and drayers going when I checked the time it was @NUM2, I did not want bother my mom but I had to say something. I just wanted to secam but I calmed myself down. I have to patience I thought in my head. After a while it felt like my head was going to explode. I couldn@CAPS2 take any longer, then fenilly something slipped out of my mouth Are we ever going to go!! @CAPS1 @CAPS2 though in my head. My mom just answered @CAPS3 only @NUM3 now just be patience. I shut my mouth and did not say word about when we were leaving. Then it was time to go and I was on time for the show. That is a time when I was patience."
7," One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON1's house. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and i ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON1 laughed more then ever!  We started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS1. I can't really remember what movie is was but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things.  After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON1 sat next to me. Her dad came in about @NUM1 minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put in on my lip because he had done it before. it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hoped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON1's laughter and her dads footsteps. I waited in her closet for like @NUM2 minutes and the got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON1 and I laughed about the whole thing.  After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. we were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. there were tat poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tad poles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that there would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about @NUM3 and a half hours. after that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find and so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span we had to scoop all out the soap and water out again. All of this took about @NUM4 hours but it was really and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she doesn't have to do it.  After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON1 said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Over all, I think on this day I laughed more then ever before."
7," We were all ging out in to the woods to go ride quads and trikes, @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 had quads I was the only on with the trike. We loaded the trike and quads in the back of the truck and trailer and was off to the woods. We get out their and uloaded our rides, we get all of them warmed up but the one with a clutch. the only way to get that one started is to pull it with the automatic quadWilber says to @PERSON1 that he will get it started so u pull me. I get up their and hook the rope on to aech quad @PERSON1 says hes ready,so @PERSON1 is taking off fast and some how the hook just comes off and hits him prfectly on his back he gets up and it looks like hes dancing. He lifted up his shirt and asked s if there was any mark, oh man was there the hook hit him perfectly, it looked judt like a hook wa printd on his back.             @PERSON1 starts to taer up a liitle bit while holding his back. i didnt blame him i would of to, u could hear it snap when it hit him. I look over at @PERSON1 and hes trying not to laugh, @PERSON1 looks over at @PERSON1 and gets off the quad and started to chase him. I finally got there attention and said,""we came out here to ride not to kick some ass."" we finally get the bike going but @PERSON1 was to scared to pull the quad so i had to do it, as soon as we get the quad with the clutch to warm up, a cop car comes down by us then turns his lights on. We new what we were going to have to do so as soon as i see @PERSON1 take off i took off. @PERSON1 and I look back to see if @PERSON1 was behind us and no he was not.             @PERSON1 told me we should just leave him ,but i told him that would be way to mest up we come back and the cop told us he was suprized that we came back. we asked @PERSON1 what happend and he didnt know after dealing with the cops for the day, we tried to figure out what was rong with the bike and we found out some one was messing with the carbrator and they were totally off.             it sucked we dont get our licences tikll we eighteen ,but for @PERSON1 its twenty one, that really sucks for him. After that one day @PERSON1 promised that he would never go with @PERSON1 and I again.             "
7," Through this great, long @DATE2, working as a crew girl, I met a ton of new people and built many new friendships that created many new memories, and all of those memories, even though they came from cleaning bathrooms and washing dishes, make us happy and make us laugh. My favorite memory involves @PERSON2, also known as @ORGANIZATION1, a short, blond, intelligent @NUM1 year old girl who loved to read, write, and singing songs, often changing them to fit with our daily lifes. Christy, refereed to as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, is extremely tall with short brown hair. She is a @NUM2 year old who is outgoing and lots of fun, even though she was the leader to the crew girls. Another important person to this story is @PERSON3, @PERSON3 was the ""@CAPS3"" at camp for high school week. He is a short old man who was very awkward sitting around a table eating dinner with @NUM3 other girls. The last main @CAPS4 is me, @PERSON1, know at camp as @CAPS5. I'm a little shorter than average, with long brow hair. I'm very talkative and outgoing, I love to read and spend time with my family and friends.  At the beginning of each week the crew girls were all given a job. This particular week @ORGANIZATION1 and I were given the task of going and helping out at the high school camp. We, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I loved working at the high school camp it was so much fun. We were having a great time, spending hours singing songs while washing dishes, all by hand, having water fights around the house, riding in the back of the trailer from camp to camp, and other random jobs we were told to do. Such as washing cars to going on @CAPS8 runs. All in all this week was building great new memories with lots of fun and laughter.  Everything twisted about half way through the week. @DATE1 was not going as well as we expected. First off we were running late which crammed us for time the rest of the day. We all were stressed running around like chickens with our heads cut off, which is even harder to deal with, people running everywhere bumping into each other getting upset. Just crazy all around. Everyone needed to calm down or people could start getting in the way and getting hurt on accident. Another problem, or the first accident, was that @PERSON3 was stepping over the hitch and ripped his pants. This means we now need to go to his house and get him new pants before we drop off the food, which delayed us even more. @ORGANIZATION1 and I jump in the back of the trailer to make sure nothing goes wrong back there with the food. As we go up the hill we notice that the heater, which weighs about @NUM4 pounds, is loose and not hooked up like it is suppose to be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have no idea what to do. Many thoughts went through our minds, what do we do about the food, how are we going to keep ourselves safe, should we jump out of the trailer, we were clueless on what to do. There was no way we could have contacted @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @PERSON3, and it would be about seven minutes until we stopped.  @PERSON3 decided to let us out at the high school camp before he went home to change his pants because he realized we were still crammed for time and neeed to drop off the food as soon as possible. As we unloaded the food @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was upset with us, she though she could trust us, she wondered why were we messing around with the heater, and told us we were lucky that almost all of the food was still edible. Finally when we got it all set out and got to sit down ourselves we told @CAPS1 @CAPS2 what happens and how we didn't undo the heater. She was super apologetic and was glad we were still here and figured out a way to keep us and the food safe. After this we were just living in the moment, and cherishing every second we had together. Laughing about all the good times we had this week and previous weeks. How glad we all were that we met and got to know each other. The last thought of the day was how happy we all were that these things happened to us because with them we grow closer and encounter more and more memories that we get to laugh about together forever."
7,"Remembering all the great times my friends and I had brought much laughter. @PERSON2 and I met in kindergarden. I walked into my new classroom frightfully, clinging to my moms side. I sat down by a very shy girl. Her named just happened to be @PERSON2. I glanced at her and caught her eye. She said hello to me. That's where it all began. One day, @PERSON2 and I walked into the classroom together to start the new day of school. Our teacher had assigned us a project that had to do with glue. We sat down next to a girl named @LOCATION1. She was a short, light brown hair girl, who we thought was a little strange. During the time we were working on our project, we tried to talk to @LOCATION1, but instead of her talking to us, she swiftly picked up a glue stick, took of the cap, and started eating it. The room went silent and @PERSON2 and I burst into laughter. Third grade came around, and @PERSON2 and I were still bestfriends. We were getting older, and in our minds, more mature. We started hanging out with different people, and playing seperate games at recess, making not much time for eachother. We missed eachother, so I told her we needed to stay close because I wanted her to be my bestfriend for life. She was truely the best friend I had could have ever asked for. I remember one day at recess, when @PERSON2 was hanging out with a different set of friends then I. My friends and I were playing four sqaure. @PERSON2 got mad at me for not playing with her, and that was our first fight. I didn't understand why she was so mad about not playing, because she could have waited her turn in line. I went home and cried to my mom. She told me not to worry, because we were such good friends that nothing, not even a little fight, could make us no longer friends. The next day, she came up to me and said she was sorry. We hugged and started to laugh. @PERSON2 was truley, my best friend. Sixth grade hit. And we were still good friends. We picked all the same classes to be into together. We had @CAPS1.E and band. @PERSON2 and I chose to pick the clarinet to play. A very challenging looking insrument to play. We went to the meeting together, to rent our clarients from @ORGANIZATION1. Our band teacher was @PERSON1. After getting our new instrument, we went to band class the next day, to learn how they work. At first they were extremely difficult to play, and we began to get frustrated. No one understood how badly we wanted to be the best clarinet player in class. @PERSON1 also began to get frustrated, with @PERSON2 and I. We never really listened to him, and that's probably the reason we were not so good at the clarinet. After awhile, @PERSON1 decided to seperate @PERSON2 and I, and he put us on seperate sides of the room. Oh how we did not like that. We still would pass notes and talk in class, not really caring what the teacher said. Finally he put us back next to eachother. We started to get really good at playing. The parade came along, and @PERSON2 and I wanted to "
7," Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away."
7," Laughter is a key to many relationships. In fact, many of my relationships started because of someone laughing. However, one relationship strikes my memory most. I was in my junior year of high school. I had been talking to this guy online and I was just leaving to go and meet him. My friend and I were walking to the park to meet a couple of guys. As we reached the park, we noticed two good looking guys sitting at a picnic table looking just a little bit nervous. I had met one of them about a week ago, yet I was still nervous about meeting up with the guys. @PERSON2, being the bravest person in the park, walked right up to the guys and said ""@CAPS1 @PERSON3! Is this @PERSON1?"" @PERSON3 just nodded. I went and sat down by @PERSON1 and it was a bit awkward. @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were talking about everything under the sun, and @PERSON1 looked at me. He asked me ""@CAPS2 you remember how long it took you to friend me on @CAPS3, after @PERSON3 told you about me?"" ""@CAPS4,about two seconds?"" I guessed. I was so nervous; I might have puked. ""I was so shocked that you even added me. I was sure that you were crazy about @PERSON3, but I thought that you were the cutest little devil. I remember thinking to myself 'I will make her laugh when I meet her and I will be completely in love with her.' I was right, I @CAPS2 love you. However, I haven't heard you laugh yet,"" he explained. ""@CAPS5, tell me a joke."" I flirted, though he didn't detect it. ""@CAPS6, ok. What did the red monkey say to the blue monkey?"" he asked. ""I don't know,"" I replied. ""@CAPS7 we can make a purple monkey,"" he finished. ""That's so cute!"" I giggled. ""@CAPS5, thank you @ORGANIZATION1. I'm glad you liked it,"" he replied back with a mannered @CAPS9 draw. I giggled at his draw because I had never heard one so sweet. He laughed because I explained why I was giggling. Throughout the rest of the day, we kept each other laughing, and our bond grew stronger. By the @TIME1, we knew that our relationship was just beginning. What we didn't know yet was how strong our bond was, and that we would be in an impossible prediciment. We knew that we wanted to be @CAPS7, we just didn't know just how long we wanted to be @CAPS7. In the following six months, we still found laughter and love in each other.  So, laughter is a key part of a relationship. This is key because it can pull love into the equation. Laughter is key because without laughter there could never be happiness;without happiness a relationship could never be successful."
7," My dad always says, ""Laughter is the best medicine."" I never really thought about it, as far as i was concerned it was just some old saying that had nothing to @CAPS4 with my life. Then one day, I realized that laughter was ,and is, truly the best medicine.  Last @DATE1 i was having a terrible time. Constantly worrying about my junior year and the college courses I would be taking. I was working five days a week for seven to eight hours a day. My job was irritating and stressful, making me constantly on the edge of a break down. I never had much time for hanging out with my friends or going to the lake like most fifteen year old's @CAPS4; @CAPS3 my weekends were spent catching up on sleep and babysitting for my parents. I never got to stop and just take a deep breath to calm myself and my nerves; i was on the go non stop.  One day, after a long day at work, i came home to find my house a complete and utter disaster. @CAPS3 of asking me how my day was or trying to talk to me and make me feel better, my mother says, ""@CAPS1! Why haven't you done the dishes?"" or ""@CAPS1! Why is the front room a disaster? Clean it now."" @CAPS3 of reasoning with her or trying to tell her about my day, I blow up! I tell her how I never get a break and how ""horrible"" my life is going; that I never, ever get one second for myself. How I am exhausted all the time and I can never @CAPS4 anything right. I say, ""@CAPS4 the dishes yourself."" I storm out. As I am walking out of the place I call home, all I can think of is how incredibly wrong my mother is. Does she not know how hard I work everyday? Does she not realize how much stress I have in my life? Of course not! How could she? Okay, yes she does work. Okay, yes she never has time to hang out with her friends either. And fine, she has to come home from a hard days work only to realize her house is destroyed and she is the one who has to clean it. That is when it dawned on me, I am a whiner! How can I be the one complaining when, hello, my mother has it just as bad as I @CAPS4, and @CAPS3 of talking to her about it, and trying to reason, guess what I @CAPS4? Yell at her then make a grand exit. How immature.  I go back inside and find my mother sitting on the couch reading her book. She looks up at me and gives me the I-know-how-you-feel look. I immediately start crying, letting all of my frustration and irritation out of my system. My mom gives me a hug and kisses my forehead. I then realize, how incredibly pointless this whole entire scene was, and start laughing hysterically, and my mother laughs with me. We laugh for about ten minutes until we decide that enough is enough.  Even though after that, my mother and I never shared words we had a secret agreement: not to let the little things get to us. We continued on our days; working, cleaning, and anything else we needed to @CAPS4. Our little ""laughing fit"" help both of us realize that it is okay to have a break down here and there, but to remember that things are hard for everyone, and to just take a deep breath and continue on the race we all call life."
7," The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a fluorescent lamp shaded in the corner. Our blaring television screening an action packed, science fiction movie drowns out profane rap music escaping from my brothers headphones. Cuddled up on the couch my sister, @PERSON2, and I alternate braiding each others hair. Our small kittens @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON1 race to their food and water. As always @PERSON1 is superior and @ORGANIZATION2 scurries up the dining room chairs, defeated. Irritated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sighs heavily with frustration once @ORGANIZATION2 trips his laptop charger and rips it out of the socket. Keys jingle, the door slams, speedy footsteps: @CAPS3's home!   By now it is @NUM1 o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everybody seat checks after snatching some food. The aroma of spicy @CAPS4 food steams the entire apartment as everybody feasts on chalupas and gulps down @ORGANIZATION1 from @LOCATION1. Napkins are distributed and the cats linger around our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is portioned between the cats, which causes a bit of ruckus. @PERSON1 undertakes @ORGANIZATION2! The thief in @PERSON1's attitude begin to shine through as she robs @ORGANIZATION2's portion. This causes @ORGANIZATION2 to hiss at her, and proceed to hop onto the coffee table. On the way, she charges through the five drinks at the end of the table, managing to knock over two of them. Then the nacho cheese, being very unnoticeable, coats her striped gray paw leaving one-inch, yellow-orange circles to puzzle us. Minute but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of @PERSON2's chalupa. Raining down the coffee table are trails of blue fizzy @ORGANIZATION1, and puddles gather at my feet the new suede couch. Smothered by booming laughter, @PERSON2 screams at @ORGANIZATION2 for stealing her chalupa. Following the escape of @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1 trots innocently behind her. My sister is still steaming angrily so in attempt to calm her down, I take off my newly @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1-stained sock and catapult the mess toward her head. Instead of the sock slapping her in the face like I had hoped, it whistled past her ear and splashed in the fullness of my mothers stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family is cracking up! @CAPS1 @CAPS2 reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the chuckles die down and we prepare ourselves for the next humorous incident.  I am freezing and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just lounging around, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is frustrated from failure of employment, and @CAPS3 is weary and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us: laying our busy brains on a fluffy pillow and allowing slumber to take over our life for the next @NUM1 hours. Looking past our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with one another. Considering the fact that @PERSON1 is younger than @ORGANIZATION2, hilarious situations such as this, amuse my family daily. Surprisingly @ORGANIZATION2 wore the warrior suit this time which added a few extra minutes to the process of the hilarity. Not only that, by also the fact that it took a toll on everybody's dinner. My family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations. The main element in our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever. "
7,"While living in @LOCATION5 I met the two people, whom are now my best friends, @PERSON1 @CAPS14 @CAPS1 @PERSON6. I met them both in entirely different ways. @PERSON1 threw school, @CAPS14 @CAPS1 threw paintball.  I met @PERSON1 when she moved from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. her dad was in the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS14 had been transferred to the base that was close to where I lived. We had two classes @CAPS14 lunch together. At first her @CAPS14 I didn't really talk much. It wasn't until one of my friends, @PERSON3, brought her to sit with us during lunch. Our friend @PERSON4 was overly hyper that day @CAPS14 ended up falling backwards in his chair @CAPS14 scaring some girls who'd been walking by at the time. We laughed so hard our faces went cherry red. After lunch we had class together, so we walked together @CAPS14 talked about lunch. I then asked her to sit with me during @CAPS3. We could not stop talking to save our lives. Luckily it was a free sketch day, for had it not have been we might have been in some trouble. After about a week had gone by @PERSON1 @CAPS14 I found out we had so much in common, it seemed almost unreal. Never had I met a girl who could make me laugh so hard that I actually enjoyed hanging out with every day. She'd make faces @CAPS14 tell me stories about her past that would make me just bust out laughing. We talk almost every other day threw the internet, @CAPS14 even though she's over @NUM1 miles away, she can still make my stomach hurt from all the laughing. As for @CAPS1, he grew up in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, then later on moved to @LOCATION4. We met while my dad, brother, @CAPS14 I went paint balling at a place called ""The @CAPS5"". It was a slow day. Not as many people were at the fields as normal, @CAPS6 some how there weren't enough tables. We offered to share ours with two guys whom I found out on were @CAPS7 friends, @CAPS8 @CAPS14 @CAPS9. As it got later in the day @CAPS1 @CAPS14 a few other friends, @PERSON5 @CAPS14 @PERSON2, arrived. The games got a bit more interesting, but still not one person had been able to shoot me out before the referee called time. I was starting to get irritated with the lack of experienced players, when finally I felt two sharp paint @CAPS14 heard a splat. I'd taken shots to the leg, mask, @CAPS14 trigger finger. When the game was over I spotted the guy who'd got me out. That person being @CAPS1. I ran over to him @CAPS14 said ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13"". He laughed @CAPS14 said ""that wasn't luck, I chose get you out"". I asked ""well then why haven't you got me out before? huh? You know that was so totally a @CAPS12 @CAPS13"". He returned with ""I was just going easy on you, I didn't wanna make you feel bad"". By then I had a smile on my face @CAPS14 a giggle in my voice ""sure, that's why"". We continued to joke about the game, @CAPS14 the people who were playing that day. When it was time for me to go he wrote his e-mail on a small torn piece of cardboard, @CAPS14 asked me to keep in touch. As soon as I got home I sent an e-mail saying ""I still think it was a @CAPS12 @CAPS13"". Ever since that day we've been best friends. Still in almost every conversation one of us @CAPS8 mention the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @CAPS14 it makes us laugh every time. Though I don't get to see my best friends every day, We still make each other laugh long distance. It's just that now I get to spread the laughter to new people, @CAPS14 hopefully I'll get to make more wonderful friends like the two I've already discovered."
7," I never understood the meaning laughter is the shortest distance between two people, tell I dated @PERSON2. We started to date in the @NUM1 grade. @CAPS6 indeed, you @MONTH1 think it was puppy love, @CAPS4 i still think to this day it was real true love. We lived about an hour a half an hour away from each other and only got to see each other two or three times a month, @CAPS4 it was still the best time of my life, with all the good and fun times we had. We met through my ex boyfriend, and his best friend @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @PERSON1 went to school with me and @PERSON1's mom and nicks mom were best friends, so they grew up together and were best friends as well. To sum up how we met is, I was dating @PERSON1 and was supposed to go to the movies with him and his friend, @CAPS4 @PERSON1 didn't show so I was stuck with @PERSON2 and we hit it off right after that. The more time we spent together the more times we laughed, had fun and as well as that, made memories to last a life time.  If we couldn't see each other we would talk on the phone for hours. (and when i say hours i mean like, @NUM2 hours.) or we would text nonstop. we would make funny jokes, talk crap about people we hated, talk crap about family, and last @CAPS4 not least make fun of each other. we would just have so many good time just talking and laughing our time away. After about @NUM2 months of dating, things went for the worst."" I just cant do this long distance thing anymore"" said @PERSON2."" @CAPS2? @CAPS2 cant we just work things out?"" i said with tears starting to come out."""" @CAPS3 it just isn't far to us."" @PERSON2 said with hesitance in his voice."" @CAPS4 think about all the good times we had? all the laughs and fun times we had?"" I started to smile, just thinking about all those times we had."" @CAPS5 yeah, @CAPS4 is that far to us?"" @PERSON2 Said."" @CAPS6 it is, as long as we have each other nothing it to bad for us. hehe"" I said knowing that he was changing his mind slowly. "" @CAPS7 now i know i need you."" he said laughing in the back ground.After that night everything was good, for a while. we had fights like that on and off and thing with my family and his family made it vary hard for us to be together. @CAPS4 we did it for a year and a half. @CAPS4 even after a year and a half of our life's we still couldn't make it. not ever laughter or good time kept us together. @CAPS4 it did keep us together for that long. Laughter was a big impact in that relationship and i thank god that it was.Even to this vary day, i can still look back and laugh at all the good and funny times we had together.Laughter can keep two people that leave from a far together, @CAPS4 the real question is how long can that laughter keep them together?For a day?A year?Three years?Or maybe a whole life time?Only time could tell."
7," Why did the dinosaur cross the road? Because chickens weren't invented yet! @CAPS6 laugh at the humorous little outburst. Or, perhaps your friend just slipped on a grape or ran into a pole. @CAPS6 guys chuckle at how clumsy your friend can be. Whatever makes @CAPS6 giddy, laughter always puts a little sunshine in your day, helps relieve pent up stress and maybe even improve your relationships with other people.  Being a full time student can be tough especially if @CAPS6 have a heavy course load such as honors or @CAPS1 classes. Not only do @CAPS6 have to worry about upcoming exams and keeping up with all of your homework, but there are other things as well like sports, clubs, getting ready for the @CAPS2 or thinking about college. My point - @CAPS3 is difficult. Luckily, there are little pleasures to be found. For example, @TIME1 while struggling with trying to understand what @PERSON1 was saying in his second inaugural speech for my @CAPS1 @CAPS5 class, I soon found myself watching a movie my dad had rented. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7"" it was called. I had been dying to see it. So I put @PERSON1 aside. He could wait - not like he was going anywhere. The film was unbelievably hilarious. I found it hard to control my laughter so as not to wake up my younger siblings. After making sure all the characters received exactly what they had wanted, I turned back to @PERSON1 refreshed and ready to tackle the assignment. Amazing how stress-free one can be after giving into a little relaxation and entertainment.  On a plus side to the school issue, it is a time to socialize with people @CAPS6 @MONTH1 not see often. Yes, it is true, laughter makes the heart grow fonder. That is why it plays such a tremendous role in our lives and our connections with others. Making someone giggle or laughing because of someone else brings the two of @CAPS6 closer together. It can strengthen a bond between two people because it demonstrates that @CAPS6 allow your guard to be let down around that specific someone. Friends are the joy of our lives and help guide us in this crazy world without them we are left in the dust or miserable. They help put a smile on your face whether your day is on the rocks or as high as the sky.  To help @CAPS6 understand what I mean, I will share an example of this kind of ""special laughter."" I have this friend - her name is @PERSON2. We've known each other for a while now, but what makes our friendship special is that we are total goofballs in front of each other and most people just don't get it. She claims I make the funniest faces in the world and she throws a giggle fit every time I shoot my ""pirate look"" at her. Nobody else laughs though which is why it makes it special between only us. Yep, we've become two peas in a pod over my weird faces. Isn't that nice? In conclusion, laughter is a big part of our lifestyle. It allows us to let go of some stress and it creates bonds between people. We live day by day laughing all the while. With people, at ourselves or just to exercise our laugh box - anytime, anywhere. When was the @TIME1 time @CAPS6 had a good laugh?"
7," Laughter is a @CAPS1 part in my life. Laughing makes you feel better. Its all around a good time. When you laugh it either means one of many things. @NUM1.) Someone is trying to cheer you up. @NUM2.) @CAPS2 just plain funny and @NUM3.) @CAPS3 are @CAPS2 so dumb, its funny. In fact I try and laugh everyday. Just recently i had been hanging out with a couple friends and we all walked away with some memories. @CAPS9 is what happened..  Last @DATE1 @CAPS4 and I were sitting on my couch when @PERSON3 called asking if i wanted to hangout. i said ""@CAPS5, but i have @CAPS4 with me."" @CAPS7 we were hanging out downtown his brother, @LOCATION2, called. He asked ""what are you guys doing?"" and if @PERSON2 would come pick @LOCATION2 and a couple friends up to hang out for a while. We went to pick him up @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @ORGANIZATION1, to give them a ride to meet up with a friend.  @CAPS7 we are waiting for there friend to show up, @CAPS9 random crazy lady gets out of the car parked next to us. She starts walking around the car extra slow and everyone in the car is confused on whats going on. Oddly enough @LOCATION2 friend pulled up at the same time. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON4, and @LOCATION2 all jumped in that car. @CAPS3 drove off and then @PERSON2, @CAPS4, and I pulled out of the parking lot and went to get something to eat. Mainly because that lady creeped us all out. It was kind of a ""you had to be there"" type deal. We all laugh and make jokes about it to @CAPS9 day. Its going on a week now and all of us are still cracking up about it. I think that my life is basiced around laughter. I could tell you at least twenty funny story if you asked right now.  Oh, one more thing about laughing and things you and other people @MONTH1 not think about to often, @CAPS2 funny comes from @CAPS2 random and enjoying life, saying to yourself when you first wake up, ""@CAPS9 is gonna be a good day."" Laughter is a huge part of my life. i think its a healthy thing to laugh everyday at least twice, and if you laugh more then that thats awesome your an extra healthy person. "
7," Has anyone ever told you to turn that frown upside down? Well did you? Laughter is the cure for all, no matter your mood whether your sad, lonely, angry or just bored all you need is a good laugh. Some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people, if you can't laugh with someone then they aren't good to be around. Laughter reminds me of my favorite quote ""@CAPS1. Laugh. Love"" Which brings me to a little story of when laughing saved a very boring camping trip. It was the middle of @DATE1 and my parents decided that we wanted to go camping so we packed up all our stuff and hit the road, the drive was was two hours of doing absolutely nothing, so by the time we got to the camp grounds the whole family was grumpy and tired, from there i thought to myself that this is going to be one long weekend. After all the yelling about where the tents go and who gets what we were finally all set up, i shared with two of my sister's so i thought it wouldn't be to bad we could at least try and have some fun, @CAPS2 in the tent was boring and my dad wouldn't let us go to the beach that was across the street so we sat and sat and sat. What would you do in a situation like this? probably nothing close to what me and my older sister @PERSON1 did. we thought we would try and have fun by siting in the tent listening to music, when that started to bore us @PERSON1 said ""lets make a video"" so we cranked up the music and started screaming and dancing around like maniacs and @PERSON1 recorded it on her phone. After making one video we watched and started laughing to the point that we couldn't breathe because of how crazy our videos were, when we made our second video it was hard to keep a straight face which was quit hard because we know what we looked like, by the end of that video we had tears in our eyes because of how hard we were laughing. That brightened our entire mood and made camping a lot more fun, we went from not doing anything to screaming songs around the camp fire. People said after that night me and @PERSON1 will @CAPS1 ten years longer because laughter is the key to a longer and better life, so keep that in mind the next time you have a frown on your face."
7," Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist."
7," Once when I was on my way over to my best friend @PERSON1's house, she called me and said that I wont be the only one over there hanging out that day. She said her friend ,@CAPS1, had surprised her by showing up unexpectedly at her house. I wasn't going to leave and be rude, so I still proceeded on going over and enjoying some girl time. The drive was about an hour long and I had fallen asleep in the car while my mother was driving next to me. The car had come to a complete stop and the rumbling under the hood had awaken me from my slumber. As my eyes began to opened I realized I've arrived at my destination. I noticed an unfamiliar car that was parked in the drive way, I assumed her friend was older and it was hers. It was a black @ORGANIZATION1 with tinted windows and seemed rather expensive. I opened the door, took a step and my mother was already with my belongings. We were trotting down @PERSON1's gray, swirled, paved walking path talking about when she would come get me tomorrow. I couldn't help but to notice that the grass was so green and freshly cut while the wind was making the trees dance. A grin took over my face as @PERSON1 bolted out of the front door and we tumbled in to the yard. I was so extremely happy to be back with her. My mother said hello to @LOCATION1@NUM1's mom, and left for the evening. @PERSON1 and I ran up her stairs while packing my stuff up like mules, we were out of breath by the time we got to the top. Everything was going just how i thought it would be, this was until we got into her room. @CAPS1 was laying on @PERSON1's bed as we entered, her face was the only thing that moved. This sassy smile crossed her face and her eye balls were lost in her head from rolling back to far. All of a sudden i felt awkward and didn't know how well I was going to fit in. They were watching a reality television show that I was not aware of and never heard of before. Jumping up asking to go make some food they looked at me and said, ""you know where the kitchen is."" I never felt that low in her house before, I don't know why it effected me the way it did, but I felt as if I were in my own home, alone with no one to talk to. So I ran down the mile long flight of stairs and made up some juice and brought it up stair to share with everyone. @CAPS1 snapped at me, for that wasn't the kind of juice she liked, @PERSON1 didn't even budge just laughed, I put on a fake smile; said ""sorry."" I put the jug down and didn't know how to act after that. Her mother came up in the room and informed us that dinner was ready and we should all go wash up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 were excited to go eat but I felt like a troll, slump and sad. This was not how I was expecting things to be. While we were in the bathroom @CAPS1 was joking around with me and I was shocked, I didn't know how to respond. A low deep chuckle exited my mouth and everyone began to laugh with me and at me all at the same time. It was quite weird how the ice was broken in the bathroom ,but now I feel more comfortable around them. We made a bet who ever gets to the table first doesn't have to do the dishes. Bolting down stairs for the first seat at the table, @CAPS1 slipped on the floor and tears rolled down my face as if I were crying in pain. But it wasn't pain, it was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. She got up and @PERSON1 beat us all to the dinner table first. @CAPS1 and I got stuck doing the dishes for the night, while @PERSON1 just watched and laughed. We were laughing about how she fell; @CAPS1 and I really began to bond.  The night became more exciting with more things to laugh about and things to do. I'm glad the awkwardness vanished and we all are getting along bonding as friends, making fun of each other along the way. This is the night I realized that just because you don't know someone doesn't mean its going to be terrible. You should break the ice first by doing something funny and making people laugh. I did some pretty embarrassing things that night, but it is all memories and we still laugh about it today."
7," When I was ten my grandma used to say that laughter was the best medicine anyone could prescribe. My grandma is dead now but when ever I'm feeling down I can always remember her words. Mother doesn't believe that. She believes the best cure is gulping down a big bull of boiled cabbage soup. My mother has lost her way now that @PERSON1 has pasted. So I spend as much time as I can outside the house with my friends ,and other relatives.  My @CAPS1 @PERSON2 says my mother is mad at herself for not trying her hardest at taking care of @PERSON1 when she was sick . All I can say to that is to have a good laugh for a change instead of being mad all the time. @PERSON2 said that there was no hope for my mother ,but I wont give up. She will laugh even if its the last thing I do. As you can see my life has been rather depressing for the last couple of years I will make it my priority from now on. I've been thinking about telling a funny joke ,or throwing a pie in her face ,or I could just get her on the floor tickling her.  There was many things I could do but nothing felt quite right. So I waited in the kitchen for her. As she walk in I said knock knock , my mom said who's there ,and I said hoooo ,and she said who who ,and I said that's right owls hoooo off of the movieGuardians of @LOCATION1. She smiled but it wasn't a laugh so after she left the kitchen I started to find ingredients to make a pie. I was going make a vanilla pie because its my moms favorite kind of pie. After I let the filling sit for a while I was ready to go on the hunt for my mom. I poked my head through my mothers bedroom door. She was sitting on her bed reading. I took the moment to ready myself for the launch. @NUM1 I ran as fast as I could to get enough speed to jump. As I was up in the air a few seconds away from landing on top of my mother I could see the horrible look on her face. SPLAT ........... the pie went every where as I was holding my breath waiting to see if I had succeeded my mom ran to the bathroom holding her face. Trying not to get the pie every where. I ran to the bathroom to see what my mom was doing. She was cleaning her sticky face. After that I gave up for the night. Tomorrow will be another day to try new ideas on mom. When I woke up I could smelled blue berry pancakes. That's odd because all we have for breakfast is cereal , so I walked into the kitchen to find my mother with a grin on her face as long as the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She said you know grandma was right laughter is the best medicine you could get. All this time I've been blaming myself for what has happened , but now I realize that it wasn't me it was her time. From now on you will never see me depressed ever again. So I believe that I succeeded in trying to make her laugh and smile."
7,"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.It was probably the best and most exciting day in my whole life. I woke up at @NUM1, but of course, that was way to early. I managed it to stay in bed until @NUM2 ,but then i couldn't stand it anymore. I stood up and put on the new red dress, I got for my @NUM3 birthday. It was my favorite and conveniently, it matched my new red shoes perfectly. I braided my hair and looked in the mirror. What i saw was really cute: a little, @NUM2-year-old girl with blond hair looking back at me with blue eyed, widened in excitement. OK that was good enough. I went to the kitchen to @CAPS1 breakfast. My mum was already awake, since she knew it was an important day for me. ""@CAPS1 a piece of toast,"" she told me and gave me a plate with a piece of toast with butter and jam on it. My favorite! But when i took a bite i couldn't swallow. I was so excited that my throat felt dry. So i just stared at the toast on my plate. My mum was worried about me since I normally @CAPS1 everything that's on my plate , but when i asked her how she felt on her first school day, she smiled, took the toast away and gave me a cup of milk. ""@CAPS2 have to drink something,at least,"" she told me "" @CAPS2'll need the energy."" I sighed and drank half of the milk. That was as much as i could take. It was about @NUM5 o clock, when we left the house. It was a warm, sunny day in @DATE1. I could hear the birds sing and @CAPS3 our neighbors dog chasing a cat. I don't know why I remember all of those little unimportant things. I @CAPS3 them like photographs in my mind. That was probably the adrenalin, that shot through my veins every time I heard the word ""school"" or ""homework"". I got into the car. my big sister was already sitting in the front seat and was waiting for us. She was @NUM6 years old and in @NUM7 grade. ""The first day is nothing special,"" she told me "" it's your last school day @CAPS2 should be excited about. that's when the fun begins!"" I knew she was trying to make me feel better, but it really didn't help. Of course she had nothing to worry about. She was this pretty, smart girl with perfect brown curls that everybody loved at school. But with me, it was a totally different deal. I was really tiny, blond and stubborn. Don't get me wrong i could be an angel, if i wanted to be, but if something was not the way i wanted it to be, i was horrible. I knew it wasn't a good thing, but i just couldn't help it.When we arrived at the school, my sister got out of the car, turned around, looked at me and said:""@CAPS3 ya at lunch, @PERSON1!"" and left me alone. So there I was, standing in the hallway in my red dress and my new backpack, too nervous to make a move. ""hey! @CAPS2're standing right in front of the door! get out of the way!"" somebody said and I realized that I blocked the door and a few kids were standing behind me and waiting for me to move. ""@CAPS4,"" I whispered and stepped aside. And then the bell rang and I had to go to my classroom. I've already been there when we went to school with my older sister on her first school day. So i knew where I had to go. I had to go right down the hallway, turn left, then right and I would be standing in front of my new classroom. Not a problem, i thought.When I arrived there I gained a little bit of my usual self-confidence back. I entered the classroom and saw my new classmates sitting in their spots. There were only two spots left. One was next to a tall boy, right in front of the teacher and the other one was next to a girl with brown eyes at the left side of the classroom. Not that hard of a choice. I walked across the classroom and sat down next to the girl. She looked very nervous and tried not to look at me. I was curious about her and when our eyes met, she smiled. I smiled back at her and so we became best friends. Since that moment, we spent almost every day together, until she had to move to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. But that's a different story."
7," I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS6 someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS2 the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened in @LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS4 was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS6 we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't @CAPS4"" he told me laughing. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS4 to hurt anyone.""  I thought @CAPS4 was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS6 I started to laugh again. ""@CAPS2 did I say now?"" he asked. ""@CAPS3. I was just remembering @CAPS2 you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS4 was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live know because @CAPS4's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS2 I had told him because he knows @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS4 got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS4 was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""@CAPS6 did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations."
7," Laughter is a way to make any situation more positive, memorable, and more enjoyable. People can use it to improve their mood in a situation in which they are uncomfortable, scared, or nervous about something. Being in some of these positions I can understand why laughter is so important. A great example would be when I went to @LOCATION3 in the @DATE1. I did things, met people, and achieved some personal goals that I wanted to accomplish, and couldn't have done it without laughing and remembering why I was there. Going to @LOCATION3 was a trip of a lifetime for me and it was one that I will never forget. I will never forget the foods that I tried, the friends I met, and some of the fears that I overcame. The first day we arrived in @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1, I told myself that I wasn't going to turn down any opportunities to try new foods, and this applied to the time I was going to spend in @LOCATION5 as well. I was a little nervous to tell you the truth, but I'm glad that I stuck with my goal. That afternoon, we all went out to do some walking around and shopping. My mom was inside of a restaurant with my coach and some of the other parents. I had to get money from her to buy a gift for my little sister that I thought would bring a piece of @LOCATION4 home with me. So I went inside to ask her, but my coach told me that I had to try what he was eating before I could have the money. I thought, opportunity!I asked what he was eating and he told me that it was @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 and that it was so amazing. He gave me a bite that had a little bit of everything on it. As soon as I had the @CAPS1 in my mouth, I wanted to spit it right back out. After I painfully swallowed the bite, I had a look on my face that made it clear to everyone that I did not acquire a taste for @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1. All the parents laughed and my coach laughed the most. I could not help but laugh myself because I could only imagine the look on my face when I first discovered that the @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 was really @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @CAPS1. While we were in @LOCATION4, we played a friendly soccer match against one of @LOCATION4's home teams. It was our first game of our trip and everyone was really excited. We wanted not only to play soccer, but to meet new people from another country that we had something in common with, and that was our passion for soccer. The match ended with a score of six to one, our team coming out on top with a victory. Of course we wanted to win, but that wasn't our priority. We wanted to have fun. After we shook hands with the other players, we wanted to exchange pendants and t-shirts so that they would never forget the team that came from @LOCATION2. We were all happy and you could tell that we were having the time of our lives. Everyone stayed on the field just talking to them and messing around with each other., taking pictures, and playing a few fun soccer games that they thought us. Some of our girls showed off their @CAPS7 accents, and girls from the @LOCATION4 team tried out their ""@CAPS8 voices"", so they call it. They would say some pretty insane things that they thought were phrases we said on a regular basis. None of us could stop laughing because of their poor imitations. They kept yelling, ""yeah snowboarding!"" I really didn't know why exactly, but I guess to them it was something we said all the time. We stayed and talked to them for hours until it was dark. At the @TIME1, we all exchanged @CAPS9 names and also a few numbers. Throughout the match and the socializing, there was nonstop laughter. We never wanted them to forget us, but I think it is safe to say that we never forgot them either.  Over the time I spent in @LOCATION3, I had done some things that I never thought that I would do. Like go on the @LOCATION4 @CAPS10 because of my fear of heights, or even have gotten on the plane for that matter.Throughout all of the found-raising, interesting meals, and moments that I didn't think I was going to get through, laughter was one of the only things that got me through the trip. It didn't just make me feel better, but it allowed me to just let go and realize that the chances of me going again and having the same experiences was very little. I'm great-full for all of my friends, the ones I came with and the ones I had gained in the @TIME1, that made this trip one that I will never forget and most of all the trip of a lifetime.  "
7,"             The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter can be used in many different ways, you could either laugh because something is funny, to be rude, or just because you enjoy what people are doing and @CAPS3 brings a smile to your face. Sometimes we shouldn't laugh at other people because @CAPS3 could hurt them even more then we imagine, and @CAPS3 could even affect their life @CAPS2 they grow older. When I was younger I faced a situation which affected me @CAPS2 I grew up. I have always enjoyed singing ever since I could remember, but up to one point I couldn't bare to sing in front of a crowd or even my family.  I was about four years old. @CAPS3 was a dark @DATE1 @TIME1, my family decided that we were going to go out to have some fun at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. This @ORGANIZATION1 was where family and friends could get together to have a great time, there would be a band playing, bright round colorful tables to sit at, drinks, and @CAPS3 had a game room for the children to play at. My cousin's and their band were going to playing that @TIME1. My family and I got all dressed up, I wore a beautiful white dress that my mother had chose for me to wear. I looked like a star in my own eyes and I was satisfied. When we arrived my family and I sat at a bright, lime green, glow in the dark, round table and watched the performance.  I danced with my parents for a long time and then I would play games with my brother and friends. My cousin who is the lead singer of the band was calling out in the microphone if anyone would like to sing a @CAPS1 to the crowd. I ran to my parents and told them that this was my chance to shine and that I wanted to do @CAPS3. They smiled at me and said ""yes sweetheart, of course you can do @CAPS3!"" @CAPS2 I ran up to where my cousin was standing, I pushed through the bundle of children so that I could be in the front. I looked up smiled, and raised my hand at my cousin shouting for her to chose me. My cousin smiled back and picked me up and placed me on the speaker! I was so delighted, I couldn't even breath. @CAPS3 was my biggest dream to stand up here with a microphone in my hand. @CAPS2 I stood on the big speaker box, I looked at the crowd of people and took a deep breath and I began to sing. I was singing my most favorite @CAPS1 that I knew by memory. The crowd smiled and clapped, but @CAPS2 soon @CAPS2 I sang the chorus of the @CAPS1 everyone started to laugh. I didn't know why they were laughing. Was @CAPS3 because I accidentally forgot to take my gum out of my mouth? Because I did happen to forget. Or was @CAPS3 because I sounded really bad? I was so scared, the gum that I was chewing in my mouth started to harden and my voice grew faint. I began to panic, my eyes started to become watery. I noticed tears coming down all over my face. I couldn't even bare being up in front of all these people if they were going to laugh at me. So I jumped off the speaker, ran to my mother, and began to cry in her lap. I cried for a long hour, my family tried telling me that everything was fine and that I did a magnificent job, but @CAPS3 wasn't enough for me to believe @CAPS3. Over the years I always detested singing in front of people. @CAPS3 scared me just having the thought of maybe someone would burst out laughing because I was either bad, or off key. After that I always began to tell myself that I had a horrible voice and I knew @CAPS3 was the reason why the crowd at the @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at me. Every time my parents would ask me to sing a @CAPS1 I would tell them ""no thank you, I don't like to sing anymore."" @CAPS3 wasn't true at all, I lied about @CAPS3 to my own parents, but I still had that horrible feeling in my heart and soul. Now that I am older I understand why I was so terrified, and the reason why the people laughed wasn't at all what I thought @CAPS3 was. My parents told me that @CAPS3 was because the people thought that I was adorable, and since I was young I couldn't really pronounce some words right. I giggled at @CAPS3, and now I just keep telling myself that I can sing because nothing else is going to bring me down, and I am trying to stay positive about @CAPS3. @CAPS3's still very hard for me to sing a solo, but after a certain period of time I will have the strength and courage to sing to anyone. "
7," Laughter is an exreamly important part of human interaction. Everyone enjoys laughing. It raises the soul up and gives connection between two indeviduals instantly. I can't think of any realtionship I've had that laughter doesnt play a big role in. If you look at your fiendships and really analize them what do you do when you get together with your closest friends? It's all about having a good time and making each other happy with laughter. I have a story about how laughter changed a group of people from being completely shy to being turned in to a bunch of friends who have a lot in common. I was on the @PERSON1 trip,and ive been on one before. It always starts out the same. Everyone gets up early, packs there stuff, and gets on the bus. At first its seperated, people sit next to people that they already knew and feel comfterable with. It stays this way for awhile, but people start to wake up and something about being traped in a box with people for @NUM1 hours starts to lighten them up. We start to play road trip games and get to know each other. Then we will start to tell jokes and thats where the laughter really starts to shine. Like I said, laughter is the best way to get to know one another. By the time you get to your destination everyone knows eachother a little and its easy to talk. As it gets later in the day people start to have small conversations with eachother around the fire and start to laugh even more. The whole trip really turns into a huge fun fest. Its extreammly interesting because its almost like a huge social experiment. People can learn more about eachother and be better firends in those @NUM1 days then in a whole year, and I know that the laughter and good times really help. Somthing about laughing seems to open you up and take controll of your emotions and sends out good vibes for everyone. I honestly can't think of a better way to build friendships, I've seen it in action. It is one of my favorite memorys and it revolves around laughter. Laughter always make a good impression, makes people happy, and burns down social barriers, and for that I belive that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It would be a extreamly sad word with out and i'm greatfull to have it play such a big role in my life."
7," An argument is defined as ""A discussion in which disagreement is expressed."" In many cases, a proverbial ""@CAPS1"" is created between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will not come to a settlement, and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view. Laughter, can serve as this bridge. The door slammed shut and I went straight to my room. I had returned home from what had started out as a good time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back I do not remember what it was about, all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again; but being as young as I was, these such thoughts rarely last. I would see him every day during the school week, but it would not matter whether he was there or not. He was absent to me as long as we fought. This seemed like a good plan, to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go quite as well as you want them to, especially when you are in the same elementary school, and in the same class.  In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were many group activities, and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with, things become difficult. Whether it was to build something, write together, or solve a math problem as a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and us fighting did not effect the group well. We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with, and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting persisted. At recess we would not agree to be on the same team, or even be on the same side of the field as one another. After about a week of this, I realized this needed to stop. At recess, I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at, or ignoring each other. The calm resolution to the problem started out well, but being children, ended in a shouting match, to which I lost. I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this. When I got home that day, my mother, being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong, asked me what was bothering me. I was resistant at first to explain things, but, being a mother, she talked me into telling her. She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences, which I had already tried. I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech. By the time she was done, all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again. The next day at recess, I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today, no matter the circumstances. When I found him and attempted to talk things out, it once again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it. Suddenly, in the midst of the yelling, my friend, with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing. I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter. Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary, only a few snickering bystanders. I ran what had just occurred back through my mind. Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This realization caused me to laugh, and everyone else nearby to laugh. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start. We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this. After about five minutes of talking, we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other. When a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended, I walked back to class feeling happy, and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends. If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight, I am not sure if we would have made up, even in the event we realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you. However, laughter can create a bridge across the @CAPS1, and provide a common ground in which problems @MONTH1 be solved."
7,"Laughter  @CAPS1 was a nice sunny day, with the wind blowing slightly. @CAPS1 was @DATE2 time in @LOCATION1 which meant @NUM1 degree weather was that to look forward to. @CAPS1 was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and the smell of spices and all different kinds of food were in the air. Just outside the kitchen; in the backyard you could smell the meat being grilled. The sound of @CAPS1 sizzling would make anyone's mouth water. My mom and I were working really hard to make all the food because we were having a family get together that evening. Preparation was crucial, all from having the food, drinks and dessert ready, to having the house clean and everything in its place. @CAPS5 everyone started arriving, the atmosphere was set and everyone was having a great time. We enjoyed the sun and slight breeze @CAPS5 we ate and talked until the sun started to go down.  @CAPS5 we picked up and cleaned, all the cousins went to the living room to hangout and talk, while my uncles were outside by the grill and my aunts were all inside the kitchen with the younger cousins. All of us were sitting around on the couch and some chairs that were brought in from outside. Stories were shared and everyone laughed all night. My brother @PERSON3 began to tell a joke. All eyes were on him and we all listened closely @CAPS5 he sat in the chair to tell his joke. Every time he started talking, he would lean back in his chair, which made me somewhat nervous, because the chair he was sitting on was a small plastic chair, while he was a big boy, weighing about @NUM2 or so pounds and leaning on the two back legs on the chair. When he told his joke everyone laughed and things were great.  The night went on and my aunt walked in to see how things were going. She began to talk and was making fun of my cousin for something he had done. We kept laughing at my cousin and @CAPS3 my brother opened his mouth to say something about my cousin, but before he could even begin his sentence, he leaned back and..POW!! down he went, clearing the two back legs of the chair right off and landing on @CAPS1 @CAPS5 he fell. Everyone was shocked and quiet for a second not knowing exactly what had happened. Once the shock of the loud snap was gone, everyone in the room stared at @LOCATION2 @CAPS5 he opened his eyes, raised his head, laid back down and stared at the ceiling and to everyone who surrounded him and murmured ""@CAPS2 what happened??"" @CAPS3, he gave a big sigh, and said, ""@CAPS4, I know you want to laugh, so go for @CAPS1, I'll give you ten seconds."" @CAPS5 soon @CAPS5 said that, everyone started cracking up and laughing at him. @CAPS5 much @CAPS5 we tried not to, @CAPS1 was just too funny. He started rolling back and fourth trying to get up, but @CAPS3 gave up after a few tries. My cousin offered to pull him up but couldn't do @CAPS1 himself so he laid him back down. @CAPS5 we looked at him, all we could see were two little plastic legs poking out from under him. Once everyone found out, my mom walked in and yelled, ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7! My chair! What happened??"" @CAPS8, this comment only increased the laughter and even @PERSON3 himself began to laugh. Finally, my brother @PERSON2 and cousin @PERSON1 tried to get him up and when they did, @PERSON3 stood up, to find the chair stuck around his waist. You could see on everyone's faces that they wanted to laugh, but @CAPS7 one wanted to make him feel bad so we all stayed quiet. @CAPS3 the silence was broken by a loud burst of laughter. @CAPS1 was coming from @PERSON3 who had just realized was had actually happened and how funny the situation was. He couldn't stop laughing and so everyone else couldn't help but continue the laughter. Once everything was settled and calm, we couldn't help but tell everyone about what had happened. My aunts and uncles all walked in and when we told them what had happened, they busted out in laughter, which was followed by tears of of laughter. My whole family had @CAPS3 found out what went on and @CAPS1 spread like wildfire to everyone that was there. So when @CAPS1 did, they would all go and ask him to retell what had happened, and so on, until finally everyone was aware and had gotten all the laughter out of their system. Without laughter who knows where this would have gone. Without laughter in life period, things would be awkward and sorrow would be all to look forward to. Luckily, laughter is all around us and so are joyful moments to remember, like this one. This was definitely going to be a get together to remember."
7,"                               Freshmen @CAPS1 All freshmen @CAPS1 was a @CAPS1 of fun. There was this boy who made me smile and laugh. I swore I was falling in love. We had one class together. Which was called @CAPS2. Passing each other in the hallway just would make my @DATE1. We met in a class that we both didn't care for. I would ask him for help even though I didn't need it just so I could talk to him. We also would see each other at the swimming pool because his brother swam and I did also. I would see him during the @DATE1 but not very often. Instead of him ""helping"" me we would sit and talk about our lives how they were at school and at home.  First semester is over and he got moved out of the class to another class period. We would still talk at the pool and see each during the school @DATE1. He would now give me hugs in the hallway. We started to become really close friends. Talking drew us even closer. Laughing was big part in our conversations. We found out that we have a lot in common. Like hunting, wheeling, foods, favorite dog and our personalities are so much alike, that it seems as if we grew up around each other. @MONTH1 came around one more month of school. I started to go to his house every once in awhile. He came to mine more often. In the beginning of @DATE4 strawberry festival came around and I asked him to go with me. He said okay and his parents also went but with my parents. That @DATE3 was fun and enjoyable. The end of @DATE4 was finally here, school was out in a @DATE1. Summer break was here. The @DATE1 @DATE1 of school was fun. It was going to be so nice not to have homework over the @DATE3 or during the week. All we did the @DATE1 of school was sign @CAPS1 books and tell funny stories about the school @CAPS1. After school I went to swim practice and after practice he was still at the pool waiting for his brother. We were outside talking and all the sudden out of know where he asked me ""will you go out with me""? I said... yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world that @DATE1. Today, in @DATE2 we are still dating. One and only relationship I have ever had. I hope we @DATE1. He tells me almost every @DATE1 that he is going to marry me. He tells me he doesn't know what he would do with out me. I told everyone I swore I was falling in love. Now everyone knows I fell in love. I fell in love at first sight. We talk and laugh all the time we hardly ever argue."
7," So there was this girl, @PERSON1. She laughs more than anyone I know, even at the slightest hint of comedy or stupidity that I would bring up. She is also a female of interest, which makes the laughter even more crucial than laughter with someone I consider ""just a friend"". Luckily, my skill of laughter is mastered with her. We met freshman year, in a study hall. At first we were both extremely shy during the ""get to know you"" activities our class would do. But as the semester went on, we started to come out of our shells. The fact that we had shared friends, that went to her middle school and i knew through other events, really assisted in our meeting. By the end of the semester, we were pretty good friends but still had much undiscovered about each other. When the semester was over, we were assigned new study halls, splitting our group up, splitting @PERSON1 and I. But to my surprise, my knew study hall, had a new found friend that I was hoping to find. @PERSON1 had the same study hall as me for both semesters. What were the chances? From there, our friendship sky rocketed. Especially because of the fact that we didn't know anyone besides each other. Every other day, we would spend a class talking, and in that time that we talked, I made her laugh about @PERCENT1 of the time. Whether it be me saying something stupid, or me making a funny comment, I made her laugh like it was nothing. And that laughter brought us to be great friends because it showed the connection we had. Not only could I make her laugh easily, but I enjoyed it. Because it makes me happy to make people laugh, plus, her laugh is contagious so I couldn't help but laugh as well. And usually, you tend to like the people that makes you laugh. So, that's what happened.  After that year we were great friends. But over the @DATE1 we started to drift apart because we didn't see each other very much. Which meant the laughter was lost. But the next year, what did you know, I had my literature class with her. And as you could guess, things picked back up again. And by the end of that year, I made a fool out of myself, made jokes, and laughed enough to the point that it began to become more than just friends. We dated. And I believe our friendship contained more laughing and good times than any others I've heard of. Now, we are back to good friends. Laughing constantly, and telling each other things that you tell people you trust. But it's not like most friendships you know. We make fun of each other and argue and fight, but all of it is fake. We don't mean any of it, and we always laugh about it, but we always disagree. Ive never come to understand how that works, but it's quite different. I'm not exactly sure why, but laughter brings people together. I think its because laughter is enjoyable, and if someone can make you laugh, you want to be around something that you enjoy. Also, I believe that laughter is a great ice breaker for a quiet or awkward situation. It also shows a sign of some form of comfort because when you laugh, you feel like at least a small amount of stress is released, which feels comforting. So, with laughter comes the rest of a friendship."
7," Can you imagine life without laughter? Life would be so serious, and relationships would be so boring. That favorite comedy? Not funny. America's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3's, how can you not laugh! Laughter is a way to express emotions in a positive manor. What is it that relationships are built off of? Honesty, trust, understanding, and humor. Do you really want to be around someone @CAPS4 is boring? Because I don't. I believe strong friendships and relationships need laughter in them to keep them interesting. Many of my relationships have begun from a joke, laughter, or me being clumsy. I remember being in a class where I knew no one, and this is a very awkward situation to be in. I sat in the back of the class, with one other person, her name was @PERSON1. It started off quite and no on saying anything, so I decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. As soon as I told it, there was a silence afterward, where we just stared at each other. Seconds later we busted out in laughter, you know the kind of uncontrollable laugh, where you cannot breath, and your tear ducts are overwhelmed to the point where tears slide down your cheeks? When this happened there is a sudden bond, a spark of friendship between the two of us. From that point we were inseparable. For the rest of the school year, we were partners on every project, multitasking our way through them. Half the time we would be making up funny scenarios, and laughing until we cried. The other half we would have make a fantastic project using the inspiration of each other to get the work done. I am an all around ""laughter enthusiast!"" I can make the smallest things funny, its a quality I enjoy very much @CAPS4 knew a silly joke could go so far? Laughter cannot be the only element to a developed relationship, you need trust, honesty and various qualities to keep a healthy relationship. My point is, how can you maintain a friendship with someone @CAPS4 you can laugh with, or be yourself with? It is human nature to laugh, you can't always be serious. I don't think that I could go a day without laughing. Laughing can be the antidote for a frown. Moral of the story, laugh!"
7," We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat, crammed together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON1, most likely a future comedian started off cracking jokes, just being himself as usual. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.  The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Shortly after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day coming. The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to preform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. ""@CAPS2 ready,"" the official began in a tense voice, ""@CAPS3!"" I threw my self our of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche ""nice job,"" or a ""you'll do better next time"". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick ""thanks,"" with a smile before we both @CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between to people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitively in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands a what a laugh can do, a laugh is universal."
7," Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile."
7,"                             laughter      why do people have so much trouble trying to laugh?Is laughter a healthy thing you should have in your health chart?This are some questions you might    ask yourself.But when you do have you thought of yourself, and maby have you thought of how much you and your family laugh all together at the dinner table or maby the family room anywere as long as you hear laughter coming out of your mouth.It doesn't matter an what you laugh about, it can be one of your family members telling a joke or even a funny show or a funny commercial. it doesnt matter as long as you laugh.in my opinion laughter is an important part in your life.if you dont laugh then you must be a very seriouse person or you might even think that the world is a very boring place to be in.some how i cant really imagine a person never laughing in their life. Some examples of people that dont really laugh anymore is probably a person that lost someone close to them or that just doesnt have anybody to tell jokes with in my opinion you have to have someone to share stuff with or that will tell you jokes when your in a really bad mood.I always used to remember my mom telling my little brother an i to quiet sown whaen we would talk in the family table during dinner one day. One day i went to school and i went into health class it was weird because the teacher was talking about how we should share stuff in the dinner table and have some laughing moments. So when i got home a told my mother all about what the teacher had taught us during health class. She said ok and we tried it .It really was a good experience we were all laughing telling jokes all the time and since then we tell jokes in the family table. It really does give you some energy sometimes but at the same time if you laugh way too much your stomach will eventually start hurting.Like i told you in the first paragraph theres many different ways you can laugh for example if you watch a comody show i very good idea would be @PERSON1 that show always mekes me crack up sometimes my mom thinks im crazy. Or ever family @CAPS1 thats such a great show to watch wene your really in a bad mood. Another way to make someone laugh is telling jokes theres the knock knock shows and then theres the guess what i am jokes . but one way your really going to make somebody really laugh is tikling that always works theres no way you cant ever make someone laugh. Eather have someone always do it for you because i know that you cant do it to yourself that would be really weird or have a @CAPS2 see who laughs first contest.It wont always help you with your problems all the way but it will make you feel good for a little bit it will really make you forget about the bad things for a while. I heard tha t if you laugh alot suposlly you live longer so i think it does help you with your problems."
7,"Laughter, Is laughter not the joy and happiness of many. Well its not just me that thinks so. So many people think that laughter can cure sickness medicine one might say. Its the mane thing to keep a relationship strong. not many people know or even believe in true happiness and without laughter there would be no true happiness. for insists I will tell you two story's they are both true but you be the gauge on who,s happy-er. the first story is about my brother his name is kinton. He thought that he has fownod the love of his life.But he fiend out the hard way that she was a bitter litter woman. She never smailled or laughter they got meared. It lasted about six months. Now they have a kid its a beautiful doughtier but with no dad because of one mistake,no laughter and no happiness.                                                                          The next story is about my parents. They might not have the best relationship but win it comes to being happy and have laughter there the ones to talk to. For instance my dad dose have some anger problems and my mom is a amoshinal rec but the thing that kept them together for @NUM1 years is laughter. They both say if you font have laughter you don't have happiness you don't have anything.     There's miny story's to tell about them but there's only one that stands out a little more then the rest. It was @DATE1 I was @NUM2 my perints were thinking about geting a divors. they sat down to have a @CAPS1 take they dident wont Any of us kids around untel latter. win they did finily came out of the room they called all us kids down stares to talk. We all came down and slowly sat down. I don't rimimber what was acily sead but something my sister sead made them @CAPS2. then my dad just keped going with the jokes i looked at my mom and i saw the look in here eyes. It was the look of copashin it just suddenly came back just because a cuppel of stupid jokes. I don't know about laughter being medicine but its like glue it kept my family together there's nothing spesher about this story if your not in the family but if your in the family it changed your life."
7," To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether @CAPS3 or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed @CAPS1 mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the @CAPS3 things in life and begin to lose your patients with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and @CAPS1 boyfriend were on our way to @LOCATION1 and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went to @LOCATION1 for a vacation away from our hectic home life's and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had over booked our hotel, our car broke down, @CAPS1 credit card account was being help for @NUM1 hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk @TIME1 when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together or a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had more then enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an @CAPS2 and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a ""@CAPS3 vacation"" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call @CAPS1 bank and see what was going on with @CAPS1 account, it turned out i forgot i changed @CAPS1 pin number to access @CAPS1 account. The entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked @CAPS1 account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When i arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing @CAPS1 stuff and when he caught on to what i was doing he asked where I was going, I replied ""to luxury"". Instantly his face lit up and he asked ""how"" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as i saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car, and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness."
7," Laughter is how me and my friends connect most of the time, and that's how i became friends with a lot of them. You know when your in a new class and you don't know anybody in there so its kinda awkward because you feel like your a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and try to make new friends but I'm not always the best at it, so when i get a chance i make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester you don't really like the class but you don't want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester you find out you have a class with that person but they don't like the class so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident but i didn't know many people in the class and the people that i did know weren't really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two she made a joke and i started to laugh. The next thing we know is within a week and would talk to each other and soon enough we hung out some. About half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on and we were hanging out more and more and she was the only one i would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over we didn't know what our classes were so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were. We seen we had one class together and we were excited. The first day of the second semester we went into the art class that we had together and we were laughing the whole time. At the end of the period she told me she didn't want to be in that class because shes not an artsy type of person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period I seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still but its not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. Its a couple weeks into the last semester and we hardly ever talk sometimes it gets awkward just to be around her because its not like how it used to be. Laughter is how me and her became friends and classes is what tore us apart."
7," I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness."
7," Packing @CAPS10 bags one @DATE2 @TIME1. It was @DATE1, and it was time for me to say goodbye to @CAPS10 hometown @ORGANIZATION3, @LOCATION3. I was moving somewhere up north. @LOCATION2, a state I never knew where on the map it was. I just knew it was somewhere way north. @CAPS10 guardians hop in their green van with @CAPS10 brothers ,and cousin. I say @CAPS10 last goodbyes to @CAPS10 friends who all weep as I put @CAPS10 bags in the back of @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2. I go up to @CAPS10 girlfriend, and give her the last kiss before we parted ways. I hop in the driver seat, and drive. A week later I end up in a small town called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was much smaller than @CAPS10 hometown, and there were trees everywhere. I wasn't used to this, I am to much of a city boy for this rural area. In two days I started @ORGANIZATION1, but I didn't care because I had hard feelings toward @CAPS10 guardians for making me leave @CAPS10 happy old life, @CAPS10 friends, and most of all the girl I loved.  @CAPS12 @ORGANIZATION1 came about I showed no enthusiasm toward going instead I was like a mute. We arrived at the @ORGANIZATION1, it was tan ,and the letters on the building was a dark red. It spelled @CAPS3 which stood for @ORGANIZATION1, which threw me off because I was wondering @CAPS8 the @ORGANIZATION1 is called @LOCATION1 @CAPS12 we were clearly in @LOCATION2. Well anyways, @CAPS10 brothers and I stepped into the building, we had gotten our schedules at the counselors office. First and second period could not have gone by any slower for I felt like I was there since the beginning of time. @NUM1 period came, it was @CAPS4 ,which I particularly enjoy, and I was expecting a @CAPS5 teacher, but to @CAPS10 surprise it was a @CAPS6 women who was full of energy. The way she moved around the room made me chuckle a bit.  There were only @NUM2 kids besides me in the room four girls ,and one male. The girls looked at me with much excitement, and curiosity. I came to the conclusion that they would be bombarding me with multiple of questions. As I thought many questions where asked like ""@CAPS7 is @LOCATION3?"" and ""@CAPS8 don't you have a @CAPS9 accent."" @CAPS10 favorite question of course was ""@CAPS11 you a foreign exchange student?"" @CAPS12 I heard this I couldn't help but mess with their minds a bit. I said nothing all I did was shrug @CAPS10 shoulders ,and they assumed I didn't speak @CAPS13. So, two of the girls I overheard calling me really cute, and I tried @CAPS10 best not to smile, but I cracked one and the boy saw me. His name was @PERSON1 ,who later in life becomes like a brother to me, and @CAPS12 he saw @CAPS10 smile he knew instantly I was messing with them. He then said ""I think he is a wimp"" in words like that except not so nice. He notice I glared at him ,and he told me he was messing with me. Instantly the girls realized that they were being fooled ,and started all giggling with flushed red faces of embarrassment. Afterwords, we chatted for a bit during class, and I got to know them a little better. Lunch time came, and of course like the new kids you never know where to sit, but reluctantly I saw the familiar faces of @CAPS10 classmates in @CAPS10 @CAPS4 class who were waving their hands in order to get @CAPS10 attention ,and welcomed me to their table. As I sat down another kid who liked to dance around a lot introduce himself. He said ""@CAPS15 I'm @CAPS16."" I introduced myself ,and immediately we became good friends. After that a bunch of the kids at the table were cracking racial jokes just for fun because our table was a diverse. So I thought I tell one that I heard before I had moved. Everyone just gave me the silent treatment after I had told the joke, but then they all burst out in laughter. One of the girls at the table said ""@CAPS17 @CAPS18 your gonna get along with us so well."" and she was right since then all the people at that table have been @CAPS10 closes friends since today. That day I remembered myself thinking ""I'm going to like this place after all."""
7," It was @DATE1. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1 this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS6 liked me of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really cached his attention, like a piece of food since we had just at a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked ""@CAPS1?""""@CAPS2"" @CAPS6 said with a huge smile on his face.""@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny"" I demanded throwing a smile back at him.""@CAPS2 is funny, but.."" @CAPS6 paused for a moment.""@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?"" @PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised and my leg began to move without control. ""@CAPS6 cant know I have strong feelings for him"" I thought to my self. ""@CAPS7 just play it off like @CAPS10 hes joking..because @CAPS6 is joking right?""""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?"" @CAPS6 asked as @CAPS6 put his hand on my lap.""@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.."" I paused for a long time.""@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand"" @CAPS6 said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know @CAPS1 to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @CAPS14 much but the words wouldn't come out.""@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON1"" I laughed nervously. @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS10 @CAPS6 was saying ""Was I not clear enough"" or ""@CAPS12 I just walk away?"".  His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something on my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out!.""@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS17 always be @CAPS9"" I said feeling relived.""@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?""""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet"" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS10 it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS6 probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing. @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives ""happily ever after"". I looked over at @PERSON1 realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS6 was looking at me like @CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me any more. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line wen for some reason I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS10 I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS2 bothered me that day not even wen something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS10 it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS10 I had just got bot-ox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though i knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @CAPS14 worn out. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. As we walked @CAPS6 seemed kind of worried. ""@CAPS15 wrong @PERSON1"" I asked noticing his not @CAPS14 happy expression. ""I haven't officially asked @CAPS13 out"" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS16 ask me I'm ready"" I repliedJorge hurried in front of me and stopped me from walking. ""@CAPS17 @CAPS13 be my girlfriend @PERSON2..Again?"" @CAPS6 grindButterflies ran down and up my stomach, and my feet weakened. ""uhhhh..I mean @CAPS9 of course @CAPS7 be your girlfriend"" I stuttered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @CAPS6 began to giggle. @CAPS14 i decided to laugh too even though I didn't know @CAPS1 was funny but oh well. We got in the car and drove home. On the way it was kind of quiet but it was somehow worth it. "
7,"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where your going!"" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way."
7," Exactly what is laughter? Why do people laugh? As a sixteen year old girl I laugh a whole bunch but, why do I laugh I have always wondered why? Laughter is the most universal emotion. Babies laugh, elderly people laugh, and @CAPS4 do teens. People laugh when they are told funny jokes or stories. Laughter is shown even when you get hurt or when you witness somebody else getting hurt. I believe laughter is a huge element in our lives. @CAPS4 don't be uptight and have a laugh once in awhile, its good for you.  My mother went tumbling down. @CAPS2 all happened when my family went camping with a couple of friends. We had this beautiful campsite over looking a waterfall, plants and flowers surrounding us. There was only one default which was, the hill we had to climb to get to the water. The second day of our comping adventure was going great, until my mother came back with the water jug not paying attention she tries to run down the hill while talking. Everything went down hill from that literally. My mother tripped on a rock about the size of a babies fist, falling down on her knees while throwing the water jug up in the air. Sliding her whole body down the hill head first. The whole campsite starts laughing, everyone witnessed my mother falling on her face going down the hill. I never understood why people laughed when others get hurt. Maybe its because they know they aren't the ones getting hurt but, either way we laugh.  Don't you hate hitting your elbow? That's the worst, the pain just never stops, and @CAPS2 tingles your elbow down to your hand. No matter how hard you hit your elbow or you @MONTH1 call @CAPS2 your funny bone, you laugh don't you. I do, every time. Its a weird feeling but at the same time @CAPS2 hurts. I remember once, I was sitting in math class not really pay attention @CAPS4 I fount a magnet and @CAPS2 was really strong I clinched @CAPS2 to the table I was sitting at and I went to go pull @CAPS2 off. That's when @CAPS2 was stuck. I tried just sliding @CAPS2 down to loose some of the magnet but nothing worked. @CAPS4 that's when I had to take drastic measures, I grabbed the magnet with both hands and pulled. Have you ever done something and in the middle of doing @CAPS4, you just knew @CAPS2 was a bad idea? Well that happened to me, when I starting pulling on the magnet a light bulb hit me. I was going to regret this and of coarse I did, the magnet lost charge and my elbow went flying hitting my metal chair. I could feel the pulse in my elbow, @CAPS2 was a horrible pain in my arm. I started laughing but, this laugh wasn't like a ""ha-ha"" kinda of laugh @CAPS2 was like a laughing crying type. To think back I think I might have cried. @CAPS2 wasn't serious but I saw a tear. The class starting to notice what I have done. First my teacher told me I should have been paying attention to the lesson and not a magnet and this wouldn't have happened. I believe everything happens for a reason @CAPS4, I believe I had this terrible occurrence @CAPS4 I can write about @CAPS2 today. @CAPS2 was worth the pain and tear. At least I got a laugh out of @CAPS2. Watching television, I see a lot of commercials. My favorite commercial is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 commercial @CAPS2 make me laugh. The whole point of the commercial is having the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 mature, well in the beginning of the commercial obviously the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 isn't mature yet and @CAPS2 tells a joke, first off a talking @CAPS1 @CAPS2, whats funnier than that? But okay the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 tells the joke, ""why did the chef get arrested?"" why, ""because he was caught beating an egg."" ""ha-ha"" get @CAPS2. Jokes always make me laugh, no matter the time, place, or even, the situation. My favorite joke has to be a knock knock joke, because their always different also, you can just make one up on the spot for example, ""knock knock."" @CAPS3 there? ""@PERSON1"" @PERSON1 who? ""@PERSON1 (I ring) the door bell but you didn't answer that's why I knocked"". Tell your friends, kids, or even your grandparents brothers, a joke today I bet you and the person you tell them to will laugh. Jokes make everyone's day better.  @CAPS2 was once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 get close, Tell a joke, get hurt, push someone down a small hill, or even hit your elbow. I bet you will get a laugh out of @CAPS2. @CAPS4 after reading this do you also believe laughter is a big element of live? I for sure do. "
7," Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself "" @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing."" @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said "" hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?"" and @CAPS6 laughed. "" @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?"" I replied.  "" @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair."" @CAPS6 said. "" I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass."" I replied. "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go."" @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. "" @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?"" I said "" @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?"" @CAPS6 replied "" The bottle."" I said "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit."" @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says ""@CAPS16"". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, "" that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."""" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway"" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me "" @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke."" "" I had nothing to say"" I replied."" @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl"". @CAPS6 said."" I know, but i cant help it"". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked."" @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew"". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship. Now to me @CAPS2 is an olderto me."
7," I have known @PERSON1 since we were three years old. Together we have seen each other through our parent's divorces, deaths of family members, and the everyday trials and tribulations of growing up. We have cried, danced, sang, and played with each other. But most of all, we have laughed. Our laughter has been heard throughout the land: from the many houses I have lived in, and the few she has inhabited; all across @LOCATION2- from coast to desert; not to mention the times we have giggled in other states. For this, and many other reasons, she is my best friend. If I were to attempt to speak of all the wondrous times I have had in her company, the resulting novel would be longer than a multi-volume encyclopedia. So I will instead write about just a few excellent experiences, each one filled with its own unique, boisterous laughter.  When we were younger, most likely about eight years old, @PERSON1 and I used to run away. Not because we had particularly difficult childhoods or troubled households, but simply because we wanted to try living by ourselves. So we would cram our wee bags full of the objects we could not survive without. These packs of necessities included: our favorite stuffed animals, blankets and pillows, games we enjoyed, flashlights, umbrellas, and usually some delectable treats. We gathered it all up, stuffed it into my big red wagon, secured it with a jump rope, and set of into the world. On occasion we brought my little brother, @PERSON2, along for the ride. He would normally be squished into the wagon with all the equipment. Though we never traversed any farther than the field at the end my street, we always had a marvelous time- even if it was rainy or cold. And all the while we would laugh. We would snicker conspiratorially as we stole outside, laugh out loud as we went down the block, and giggle nervously as night began to fall. Before a few hours had passed we would be safely wrapped in the warmth of our cozy home, but those hours were exciting times when we proved that we could survive outside societies standards. @PERSON1 and I reestablish that we have no need for society when we go on our annual ""dads and kids"" camping trip. Though the number of participants and the exact location has changed over the @DATE1 seven years, the basic format has stayed constant. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, our fathers, and I fill two cars with gear and drive to the @LOCATION2 coast. Once there we spend most of our time at the campsite, hearing the same campfire stories, making s'mores, swiming in the river, and rafting to the @LOCATION1. But @DATE1 was a bit different. Instead of heading west towards the water, we went east to the peaks; eventually ending up at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And it is absolutely dazzling there: fresh mountain air, twenty minutes from @ORGANIZATION1, and the @CAPS2 is so beautifully transparent that the bottom is easily visible all the way in the middle. The @CAPS2 is quite aptly named, unfortunately, that beauty comes with a price. The @CAPS2 is so very @CAPS1 because it is a constant thirty four degrees @DATE1 round. Consequently, it takes a bit of time to become acclimated while swimming in the frigid water. Regardless, we still have a phenomenal time, and now consider ourselves experts at setting up tents.  But despite our tough survivor girl exteriors, @PERSON1 and I are quite desperately dependent on the technologies of the day. Together we have watched countless television shows on @ORGANIZATION2, listened to heaps of songs on @CAPS3, and even made a few movies ourselves on iMovie. For example, I remember the first ""full length"" (and by that I mean five minutes long) movie we collaborated on. It is called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"", and though it has almost no plot, it was stunningly fun to create. We were about ten years old and we knew, unequivocally, that we wanted to be famous in the film business when we grew up. So we thought and we brainstormed until we finally came up with an idea. Though it @MONTH1 not have been the most brilliant idea out there, it was ours. Two ordinary citizens (masterfully portrayed by @PERSON2 and @PERSON1) were having an argument over which came first: peace and war, or love and hate. A huge battle erupted, consisting of first hours, then days, and eventually weeks of pillow fighting! It felt as if it would go on forever, until @CAPS4 @CAPS5 steps in to save the day! In the end the bloopers were longer than the story itself, but we still go into hysterics every time we watch the film. It is a source of entertainment we shall never forget.  I suppose I have now managed to condense one of my most important relationships into four measly paragraphs. I spoke of the laughter we have shared: hushed, thunderous, timid, and unabashed. So remember, life is arduous, and having a best friend to share the joy is absolutely essential.   "
7," Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""@CAPS1! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS6!"" @CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS6 only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS3 and @CAPS8 would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS3 tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS5 god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON2 (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to jump. ""@CAPS6 you tell him I say hello?"" ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS8 told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON2 said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS3's friends said the same thing but @CAPS8 said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON2 came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS8 asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS8 said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS8 said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON2 out but I let it go just as @CAPS8 did when @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all. "
7,"  It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION1. Which is the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON2 and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 manager who was there. Then @PERSON2's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON2 even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON2's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives."
7," Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2 brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?"
7,"                                           ""Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too."
7," ""@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't."
7,"                             My @CAPS1 with Laughter   Laughter is the best medicine. It makes a sad and lonely person look happy. It sometimes change the perception of people base on what situation they have. It also gives joy to every single human being in the world, it's a part of our culture that is passed down by our ancestors that we can share to anybody. Laughter is a magnificent way to show that people can understand each other and most of the time show that we live in harmony regardless of our race, ethnicity and physical appearance. But there is one thing that I'm sure, laughter is the reason why I love my life. I have lots of story where laughter is a big part or a big element of my life. I can share all of it but I choose the best thing that really impacted my life. When I was a kid I'm always sad and lonely, always by myself and avoiding everybody that I see and avoid any social interaction with anybody. I used to cry a lot because of my family's status in life. We were poor and eat less than the average family. My family being poor really impacted my life more than anything else. This turn my life into a miserable one, can't do anything, can't eat normally and can't enjoy life. I thought I can't go to school but money is not a problem. My mom has a job that pays enough for me to go to school and that gave me hope to try to change my life. At first, I was very shy don't want to talk and refuse to receive help from anybody in doing my homework and school activities. I stayed like this for @NUM1 years and then one day I met a huge group of students, smart and dependable. They noticed my behavior and start talking to me, at first I don't know what to say but they encouraged me talk and don't be scared. And for the very first time in my life I'm happy, I'm happy that there are people that wanna know me and be friends with me. As I make more friends in school, they starting to notice that I don't laugh that much. They didn't ask me why but they tried to make me laugh by telling really funny jokes that make me smile and then after more jokes I noticed that I'm laughing so hard that I can't stop. This feeling of me being happy because I'm laughing so hard really change my whole point of view of life.. This event in my life is so meaningful that I always share this to my new friends. I learn that laughter can change anything no matter what it is, I know this because I experienced my life change, change in a positive way from a negative way. Whenever I talk to somebody I never forget to smile and laugh and if they ever ask me why I always do this, I just say this is what I am. Laughter is part of my life, an element of my life that gives me strength to face yesterday, today and tomorrow. It always help me to solve my own problems. It clears my mind of any bad things that I could potentially do. It helps me mend a broken spirit that needs help. Laughter also encourage me to make more friends because laughter is nothing without friends to share the happiness that I feel everyday. Laughter teach me how to make friends, it's hard to make friends when you just sit alone and don't share your @CAPS1 in life. Laughter change me, now I enjoy eating with my family, enjoy being with my friends and the most important part is that it help me grew. Laughter showed me that there is so many things that I can do without thinking about the negative things that I have in my life. With the help of laughter, everything can be viewed as positive. Laughter helps me change my negative attitude into a positive attitude, this is a proof that laughter have a deeper meaning that is yet to be discovered by me and everybody. It gives me idea of things that I can do in life, help me improved and help me build a better character for the future that is waiting for me to explore. Just like I said, laughter is the best medicine because it can heal anything. Laughter is a sign of acceptance, sign of peace and a sign of achievement."
7,"My relationship with laughter.  Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time. Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When that happened for the first time in almost a year I smiled I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am.  Later in the relationship is where laughter came into play I was laughing all the time when I was around him and not upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out but, it took all of our friends to us to hang out. After we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met. It took until freshmen year for us to start dating. That is when I found out I suppose ably dating someone else and not him I didn't believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling.   He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said ""@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. Then he tried telling me it was over and I told him ""We were never dating in the first place!"". My friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS4 did I was with another guy and I'm happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or mad he says ""don't worry everything will be okay I promise so just believe in me.""  Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore. If it leaves now I don't know what I'm going to do it's apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least I hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad I'm glade that I found someone. I hope that it doesn't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I was crying not even my friends and family. Now that laughter is here almost all the time I can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS2 of my friends say "" @CAPS3 are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on @CAPS3 she is there to guide @CAPS3 down the road."" @CAPS4 also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @CAPS1 I don't is because @CAPS4 can be bossy and @CAPS4 tell me what I can and can't do. @CAPS1 can't people just understand that this relationship isn't going to work if @CAPS4 keep getting in the middle of it @CAPS4 all think that my life revolves around them and it doesn't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that's @CAPS1 I told @CAPS3 about my relationship with laughter. Lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise @CAPS3 that much. @CAPS1 can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it? I just wish that there was a world @CAPS3 could just run away to with out anyone knowing where it's at in the world. Well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad unless we start to fight again with each other I hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen."
7," When I was about nine or ten my best friend, my brother, and I played outside for extended periods of time. During the stretches of youthful abandon we would play games, but unlike most games such @CAPS4 @CAPS1, in these games we would act out stories, play roles, and become heros of legend. While playing we would fight evil dragons and rescue princesses, although probably the most amusing thing we did was narate our stories @CAPS4 we played them. Much of our   games strongly resembled @CAPS2 of the @CAPS3, and @CAPS6 wasn't until quite a bit later that we realized what we had been doing was widely considered role playing. Now on one bright and sunny day the three of is were out scouting for hordes of goblins when, due to a combination of lack of sleep and playing outside all day we dicided to take a break. After the break was over me and my friend sent my brother out to see if the coast was clear. ( I'm not sure what went through  my brothers head to inspire him to do this, but. . .) @CAPS4 my brother came back he started to limp and act @CAPS4 though he had been thouroghly thrashed, he started shouting  "" @CAPS5 a coming, @CAPS5 a coming!!""  @CAPS6 was probably one of those moments were you had to be there, but at that time I had never heard anything funnier. @CAPS6 was, in fact the first time I had ever cried from laughing."
7," Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about."
7,"The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 are many emotions that people have that can effect themselves and the people around them. Each emotion that is within a person has it's own set of unique languages that can give out messages of how that person is feeling. An example of the use of these languages can be such as when people cry, blush, and smile. Although there are many languages that are used to describe the emotions of a person, the @CAPS1 known as laughter is the most commonly used in many peoples lives. Laughter is an important @CAPS1 that is used in the emotions of many people that can describe happiness, fun, sarcasm, nervousness, jester, and humiliation towards themselves or towards other people. Laughter plays a big role in the part of any relationship between friends and family. The many languages of laughter can be told through example from the past experiences in my childhood life.In my first story, I will explain of how laughter can be used to express jester and friendship. The story begins with me and my friend enjoying the free time of which we were seldom given in our classroom; at school. Being overwhelmed with boredom, both of us were deciding to either do something mischievous that would probably get us in trouble, or to just simply talk to each other about whatever came to our minds. Lacking the materials for our plan to build and fly a giant paper airplane across the room, we decided to go with our second choice and attempt to entertain ourselves by talking about the latest cartoon episodes and popular video games that came out. The plan seemed to be working and kept us entertained, however, we had short attention spans at the time and soon we began to be overwhelmed with boredom once again. In order to stop this from happening, my friend suggested that we tell crude jokes to each other until it was time for lunch. Interested in his suggestion, I agreed with his plan and soon we began to tell random jokes to each other. Our teacher was expecting the whole classroom to talk at a low sound level but when my friend whispered a hilarious inappropriate joke to me; I couldn't help myself and started laughing hysterically. Soon the whole classroom started to laugh when I unintentionally blurted my friend's joke out loud to everyone. Although we both got in trouble in the long run, we thought it was worth it to see everyone overcome their boredom and have a laugh with us.My next story is about how laughter can be used to express sarcasm and nervousness. This story begins with me and my friend walking to school whilst having a conversation about a presentational science project that was due that day. My friend pulled out a volcano model out of his bag and told me that his project was about how mixing two types of ingredients in the volcano can cause it to erupt. Soon he asked me of what my project was. I hesitated and realized that I forgot to do my project. Not wanting to look forgetful; I dug through my backpack to find anything that looked convincing as a presentation. Pulling out a chewed pencil; I turned to my friend and said that my presentation would be about how pencils can be used as magic wands. My friend began to laugh and replied in a sarcastic tone, ""I'm sure you'll get an A on it"". This made me laugh from sarcasm and feel less nervous as we entered the school doors.For my last story, I will explain of how laughter can be used to express humiliation. The last story begins with me playing a game of kickball on the school field. I was given the task of trying to tag the opposing team if the ball landed in my area. When the ball finally did land in my area; I rushed where the ball was going to land and caught it. I suddenly burst in my victory dance with the ball in my hand, however, my team was starting to shout at me. I then soon realized that the ball touched the ground before I caught it and that I let all the opposing players score home base. Although it was humiliating to be laughed at by everyone on the field, I too found it funny for me to make such a clumsy mistake. I then dropped and rolled on the ground whilst laughing very hardly for allowing my team to lose that day.In conclusion, each emotion has its own unique set of languages. Laughter is one such @CAPS1 that can be used to describe jester, friendship, sarcasm, nervousness, and even humiliation. Laughter is an important part of peoples emotions, just as all other languages are. This @CAPS1 plays a big role in the part of an relationship between friends, family and strangers. Laughter has played a major role in my life and in other peoples lives. Each emotional @CAPS1 has its own unique message for everyone."
7," When I was seven years old, I saw my grandparents in the living room watching one of my grandfather's favort show. I wounder why my grandmother never thought it was funny. She always sat in her little blue rocking chair, nitten away and not pay very much attention to the show. Then it donned on me, that my grandparents don't have anything incommen with each other she loved to nit, play card games. And above all things loved to keep things the same. grandfather loved to work on the house, he didn't care much for card games, partly because he wasn't very good at them. Instead he like to watching his shows and he thought that if you put a little bit of change in ones life you will be sharper in the mind for a longer time.  When I asked my grandmother what she like most about grandfather. Her repplie to me was, he makes me have little fun every once in a while, and he is a very funny guy. For a example, when I first met your grandfather, back when I was nineteen years old. I thought he was a goofball and he couldn't be trusted with any responsibility. But, that was when i first meet him, now our relationship has grown with the years we have been to together. Sence then, I come to really open up to him, in many ways. We can enjoy the time we spend luffing and making jokes about the past when we were younger. But if I had never taken that first step of getting to no your grandfather, I wouldn't have as much fun in my life and razing your father or your aunt @PERSON1 was a big part of my life, he made it fun. In concussion, I think the really question is why is he with me and how did I get so lucky to send this life time with him. Him really was my beginning and my end."
7,"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people @CAPS1 and being happy are two big parts of me and my life. I love smiling and giggling with my friends and family. I believe that @CAPS1 makes everything a thousand times better no matter what the situation is. You could be in a horrible situation and if someone makes you laugh you just feel so much better. You have to have a sense of humor to have fun in life and to make your days go by better.  I have this best friend, her name is @CAPS2. We have been best friends since the seventh grade. Were the type of friends that can make jokes about one another and not get mad, we know how to laugh at each other. @CAPS2 and I are so much a like it's crazy. We will be having a conversation and we will both say that exact same thing at the exact same time, than laugh about it. Because it happens all the time. Or we will be talking to some of our friends and than walk away and either her or I will say something and one of us would say that we were just thinking the same thing or that we were just about to say that. And a lot of the time we laugh the exact same way too, if someone says or does something funny and we laugh we start @CAPS1 at the same time and the same way. We even gasp for air at the same time. I know me and her will be best friends for a long time, just because of how much a like we are and how we share so many of the same qualities.  My family are my number one people in my life. Whenever our whole family is together its absolutely insane. Everyone gets a long. And everyone laughs together and makes jokes with one another, it's a really good time. My sister is probably my favorite person in the world. I never really get to see her that much but whenever were together it's so much fun. I get to see my sister about once a year because she lives in @LOCATION1. She doesn't really get to come visit much because she has her own family down there. She's twenty five, she's married. She got married when she was twenty one to my brother in law @CAPS3, he's such a funny guy. And she has two children @PERSON1 my nephew who is three years old and @CAPS4 my niece who is two. They are the love's of my life. There the cutest kids in the whole world. I just went to my sister's house over the @DATE1 and it was awesome. We have so much fun together. Since I never get to see my sister we try and make it the best time and we try not to fight. My sister and I have probably gotten into at the most five fights, which is impressive even though we never see each other. I love my sister. She always knows the right advice to give me if I'm having problems with my friends or my boyfriend. She's like my best friend. My nephew @PERSON1 and my niece @CAPS4 make me laugh all the time, even though there babies there the funniest babies I've ever seen.  My @CAPS6 is probably one of the funniest people i have ever met in my life. My @CAPS6 has the best sense of humor i think, he cracks jokes all the time. In the morning before he would go to work he would record himself farting on his phone and then later when i would be at school he would send it to me. Once he sent me a recording and I opened it in the middle of class and everyone started @CAPS1. It was hilarious. My dads funniest quality he has is probably his farts, he farts wherever he needs to or wherever he wants to. Once we were in the library and he walked passed this little boy and farted right behind him. He farts in the stores all the time too. My @CAPS6 is great, usually parents don't do that kind of stuff but my @CAPS6 sure does. I love it and i love his humor. My boyfriend and I fight quite a bit. But a good thing is that I always have my friends and my family to make me feel better. I always have a good time when i am with him and even when we do fight. When he knows he's in the wrong he makes up for it, makes it better, tries to make me happy and he tries to make me laugh.  @CAPS1 is the key to life. And it can cure just about anything if you let it. @CAPS1 with your friends and the ones you love is having the ability to let go of everything that is bothering you and just have fun."
7," The word (laughter) @MONTH1 mean a smile or something nice that has happened to someone or even a thank you, but for many people it means the action or sound of laughing. For many people the felling they get inside when they laugh is the felling of happiness. The sense of felling good inside is the meaning that ones in while you have to be happy in life; have a balance in your life. For me the word (laughter) means being happy and the felling of doing something good in life. For instance when a couple get married they need a sense of laughter in there life's so they can enjoy their companies. It was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2 early in the morning I was extremely exited to leave because that was the day I was going to go visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncle, and cousins that I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time.I was about to leave for two months in a half I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time I felt happy and exited to go. That morning we arrived at the air port; I was about to ride on my very first airplane. As I tried to find my seat through the big line of people that were finding their seats as well; I sat down and buckled my self into the seat and looked out the window and all over the place. My stomach was turning in circles round and round and I had the felling of a roller coaster about to take off really fast. The next thing I knew the plane was moving I got kinda of scared, but at the same time I was excited.  During the flight I felt a sense of laughter in my soul; the memories of a childhood in @LOCATION2 were turning my emotions into laughter and tears that made me fell good I had never felt. The idea of seeing all my family and friend was captivate to my hear and emotions. As we arrived at the @LOCATION1 airport; my emotions were turning in circles back and forth. We only had two more flights left to get to our destinations. I was getting tired and sleepy, my legs and arm's hurt so bad, they felt like if you were caring two big bags of potatoes on each side of my leg and arms . We decided go eat some place as we walked around to see what we could find to eat we found pizza huts. The next thing I knew was that we had only one hour our to the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. As we arrived to the gate people were already going in through the hallway to get into the plane so we hurried. Three hours past buy and we had landed in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 that was our destination. I felt a sense of laughter inside of me as we waited for our ride home; the feeling I got was as if someone had token something from me and gave it back. I started to cry at that moment, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived that late afternoon to my grandparents house, as I looked at them I felt a happy inside, they were happy as well. we decided to spend the @TIME1 over at my grandparents house, that @TIME1 nobody had gone to sleep every one was to busy talking with each other and catching up. The next day every one was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside.  We had spent a mouth in a half with family members that I had not seen in a while we all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an incredible time catching up with family and friend. We did not get to do all the things we wanted to, but the best part was the time I has with my family and friends. The word laughter to me mean the best thing that has happens to you and makes you fell good inside, or even the memories you think about when you are alone and sad, those are the memories that will make you laugh and fell good about yourself. Other people @MONTH1 say that laughter is the felling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best felling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life. Over many generations people have used the benefits of laughter in their life's for instance many famous and non- famous people, important people or non- important. Many people say that when you are not happy you are going to die not knowing what happy is. People really enjoy those moments that they spend with a special someone."
7," Laughter is what connects me @PERSON1 my friends. It's a very important aspect in any kind of relatioship. I know that almost all the memories I have are of my friends making me laugh, @PERSON1 we have been friends for a very long time. One of my favorite funny memories is the time me @PERSON1 two of my friends went to @LOCATION1 @PERSON1 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2... We sort of had a hard time getting out. Me @PERSON1 my friends, @PERSON1, went to @LOCATION1 to do a cultural performance at @ORGANIZATION1. When we were done we started heading back home. @PERSON1 kept complaining about needing to use a restroom. Her dad told her to wait until we got to @LOCATION2 so we could stop somewhere. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I suggested @ORGANIZATION2. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION2 was doint the potty dance. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I got in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate. While we were waiting @PERSON1 was searching for the restroom. After approximately four minutes of searching, @PERSON1 finally asked the lady working behind the counter where the bathroom was. She handed @PERSON1 a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it @PERSON1 told her it was outside behind the building. @PERSON1 took the key @PERSON1 sprinted to what appeared to be double dorrs. Little did @PERSON1 know that only the left door opens. She ran straight into the right door @PERSON1 fell over. we all started cracking up laughing... Especially @PERSON1. She laughed so hard that she didn't quite make it to the restroom. Instead she had an ""accident"" on the floor in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2. When you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem funny to other people, such as, wetting yourself in public, it only makes your friendship stronger. Laughing is a huge important benefit in any kind of relationship. It strengthens the relationships you already have @PERSON1 it helps build new ones also."
7,"  Fall began early, @CAPS6 was in full swing and the crispy, red stained leaves of @DATE2 fluttered to the pavement at the beginning of @DATE1. In my tired blue jeans I strode up the steps of the @ORGANIZATION1, crunching fallen leaves under my tattered @ORGANIZATION2 sneakers. With slight hesitation, I volunteered to chat with patients who don't have many family near by and for some, the most contact they receive all year is a quick call on @CAPS1. Never having met me before, they would still be thrilled to see me. Leading me, the stout receptionist, showed me down a carpet hall. Porcelain vases of fake tulips placed on antique tables lined the wallpapered walls, attempting to create a feeling similar to home. We stopped at a cheery yellow door on the right side of the hall, room #@NUM1.   Before we could knock, the door flung open with more might than I would have expected from the frail women who stood behind @CAPS6. Easily nearing her mid nineties, the @CAPS2-@CAPS3 women had tired eyes and leathery skin, her face showed her aged and wisdom before she spoke.   ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 there darling, I'm @PERSON2, and whom might you be?"" her eyes wide, she spoke with a thick southern accent.   ""@CAPS5, I'm @PERSON1,"" I extended my hand, ""@CAPS6's nice to meet to you, @PERSON2.""   @CAPS7 with elderly people isn't what I look forward to when I plan my day, especially when they aren't related to me. Different ages, life styles, pasts, and even races, stood between @PERSON2 and I. In my mind I couldn't prevent a wall from being built between us, I anticipated that our conversation would not conquer @CAPS6. I felt the dread developing on my shoulders, muttering to myself about @CAPS8 I only had to survive for the next hour and a half. @PERSON2 and I squeezed onto a narrow, yellow, tweed sofa. Across the open living room a constant hum of an outdated television added to our awkward silence. I broke @CAPS6 first, ""@CAPS8 long have you lived here?"" The silence was thick, tension pushing back on my tongue as I spoke.   That quick nervous question I stuttered, rippled into a much longer and deep conversation. @PERSON2 shared stories about everything, previous patients, terrible nurses, as @CAPS4 as the terrible pranks she has played on nurses. In between my gasps for breath, I could barely spit out another question, that only triggered another hilarious tale that @PERSON2 told so perfectly. @PERSON2's voice carried a story like none I had heard before, for such a small women her life seemed adventurous and eventful. Her stories were endless, and so was our laughter. Besides the ache in my side from my nonstop state of hysterics, I couldn't of been better. Our differences were like sugar in hot tea, dissolving before we noticed they were there. Stereotypes of race and culture that I placed between us, were whisked away and we were sewn together by our laughter. Traveling around the world to different and diverse countries you will find a variety of lifestyles, beliefs, and languages; you'll see @CAPS8 cultures change from one society to another. One of the few things that remains in all parts of the world is laughter. No matter where you search, @CAPS6 can be found, from children playing in the suburbs, to a small mud hut across the world. @CAPS6's a language that everyone speaks, @CAPS6's not exclusive and @CAPS6 doesn't discriminate, and @CAPS6's free.  Cherishing our time together, the conclusion of our afternoon grew near. If you hadn't of known, you would probably think @PERSON2 and I had been friends for years. The way we got along easily, and our conversation that flowed freely, made our relationship appear nurtured over time but laughter brought us that same feeling in only hours. Through her age and experience she connected with me through laughter and story telling. Learning so much about her life, past, family and even at her age of @NUM2, her hope for the future, I felt as though I had known @PERSON2 far longer than just a few hours. The quality of humor is one that both of us share, @CAPS6 makes @CAPS6 easy to talk to people, and makes every activity we're doing enjoyable.  Our pleasant visit ended as I walked @PERSON2 back to her room. Pausing as we approached her door, I gave her a big hug and she cracked a joke about the way she used to hug her granddaughter, yet again sending me into a burst of giggles. I assured her that I'd be back to visit, enjoy a few more laughs and maybe a cup of tea if we could manage through all of our excitement. Leaving the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I thought about the time I had experienced with someone who was a stranger when I woke up that morning, puzzled by @CAPS8 quickly laughter brings people together. @PERSON2's last words echoed through my ears, ""just like my granddaughter,"" realizing that my volunteering experience had given me a friend, and to @PERSON2, a granddaughter."
7," It all began when my best guy friend @CAPS9 the time asked @CAPS7 to go to the lake that @DATE1 with a bunch of people , I mean how could I turn that down getting tan with friends, swimming I mean it sounded fun in all so I decided to say yes @CAPS5 really fast too. I was sitting on the couch when all the sudden my phone started ringing I hurried to pick it up.. it was @PERSON2 "" @PERSON1... @PERSON2 said "" ""yeah, whats up "" ""your coming right tomorrow right.. @PERSON2 continued """"yeah, of course what time though.""  ""@CAPS2 going to be @CAPS9 your house @CAPS9 @NUM1 be ready @CAPS2 being @NUM2 exlaimed"" "" alright alright ,ill see you tomorrow.. @CAPS3 I hung up the phone.""  The next day I layed in bed wide awake @CAPS9 @TIME1 @CAPS5 was unable to even think about sleeping any more I was so excited I had that feeling where I just knew it was going to be a good day @CAPS5 knew it was going to be so much fun. Nine o clock came faster @CAPS3 ever, I jumped out of bed @CAPS5 went straight to the bathroom to get ready, @CAPS5 begin packing my beach bag. @CAPS3 finally @NUM1 rolled around, @CAPS5 my phone started going off agin @CAPS5 it was @PERSON2 "" you ready!? were outside your house .. @PERSON2 said"" ""yep, @CAPS2 coming right now..bye "" I got in the car with it jamed full of guys @CAPS5 we took off.   @CAPS9 about two o clock we got to the lake @CAPS5 all began getting out of the car @CAPS5 started stretching @CAPS3 @CAPS3 all the boys started stripping off their clothes until just there swimming shorts @CAPS5 @CAPS3 all started running right towards the water @CAPS5 all hopped in. So right away I began taking my clothes off so now all I had on was my swimsuit @CAPS3 I stared walking down too. Finally @PERSON2 comes up @CAPS5 starts telling @CAPS7 to hurry "" @CAPS1'mon @PERSON1 hurry it up run I want you to get in..."" "" I know @CAPS2 coming.. @CAPS5 @CAPS2 going to get in dont worry @PERSON2.. "" @CAPS3 out of no where @PERSON2 grabes my hand @CAPS5 begins making @CAPS7 run down towards the water. When all the sudden we hit this like muddy patch of walk way area that looked like bird poop @CAPS5 mud mixed together. As soon as my feet hit the mud , while I was running I slipped @CAPS5 fell right in front of the guy I liked @CAPS9 the time ""@PERSON2"". I had never been more embarrassed in life, but I played it out cool, @CAPS5 since everyone else was laughing @CAPS9 @CAPS7 I decided to start laughing too. @CAPS3 I notcied that once everyone had stopped laughing no one really cared enough to make it that big of deal. So I hopped back up with the help of @PERSON2's hand @CAPS5 @CAPS3 notcied that since I had just slipped in mud/poop that it was all over the butt. @CAPS9 that point I dont think I could have been more embarrassed about what had just happened..I had slipped in mud, @CAPS5 it was all over @CAPS7. After that had happen I didnt really care anymore about being embarrassed, so I walked on down to the water @CAPS5 got in right away @CAPS5 swam around a little bit so that the mud would wash away, @CAPS5 thank @CAPS4 it did. About twenty mintues later were all sitting in the sand @CAPS5 just telling stories @CAPS5 hanging out, when @PERSON2 looks over in the water @CAPS5 notices that there is a huge ""water slug"" in the water right by him, so him being a guy, he decides to go over @CAPS5 grab the slug @CAPS5 hold on to it, @CAPS5 of course.. I freak out @CAPS5 get up @CAPS5 kind of take a few steps back. @PERSON2 starts asking "" @CAPS5 who do I want to throgh this @CAPS9"" everyone @CAPS9 the point is saying "" not @CAPS7.. NOT @CAPS7"". I just stood there quit, when he looks over @CAPS9 @CAPS7 I stare back @CAPS9 him with a scared look on my face @CAPS5 say "" @CAPS5 you wouldnt through that @CAPS9 @CAPS7 becauase @CAPS2 a good friend of yours right?.. now would you."" @CAPS9 this point since right before this we were all sitting in the sand talking,I had put on a tank top @CAPS5 shorts over my swin suit, when all the sudden I hear "" @PERSON1 watch out"" I had turned around for a second... @CAPS9 the most, to look @CAPS9 something, @CAPS3 I feel this slimy long wet thing side down my shirt. I look down my shirt @CAPS5 see this slug in side of my shirt. I start freaking out @CAPS5 screaming as loud as I could @CAPS5 jumping around. @CAPS5 just when I thought it was out I look down @CAPS5 its still there finally it comes popping out of my shirt, @CAPS5 I just sat there calming down from what juast happend. Oh what a day!!"
7,"    Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether the person is a relative, friend, or someone you are dating. Laughter makes you forget your worries and problems. But with a friendship based on laughter, when do you trade in the giggles for seriousness? I believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong, healthy, relationship you also need a level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships.    Olivia has been my best friend as long as I could remember, hanging out we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a huge part of our friendship and always will be. But going into middle school we faced drama, boys and arguments, which we never experienced with one another. All of these small but important things to us then added up and began to make us drift apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings and instead cover it up with laughs caused us to bottle up anger towards each other. I always thought we were perfect matches for best friends because our countless inside jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grew until we were ready to handle it, which we did not understand then.   We started to hang out less and less, and our daily calls became weekly. Both of us noticed a change in our friendship, but didn't know how to fix it, we apologized for fighting with each other and sympathized for our boy troubles but it wasn't the same. I missed her but the longer it went on the easier it was to not talk or hang out. Summer came around and our moms planned me to stay a week at her house while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely I was less than thrilled, how was I suppose to stay a week there when we barely talk anymore? I knew everything would be okay but I still worried that the week would be constant fighting instead of laughs.    Finally the day came and my parents were driving me to her house. As I got there things were fine, we pretended nothing was going on and had fun, it was that way for a few days. But on the third day she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we don't talk anymore. That day something amazing happened, we talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bugged each other, and everything slowly became better than it was before. That talk changed our relationship forever and I'm so glad she had spoken up when I didn't or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today.    That day was @DATE1, but had a huge impact on our friendship.Ever since we got that mile stone in our friendship I knew better how to be more open with other people also. Olivia has taught me so much but this was among the more important lesson. Laughter is a huge part of any strong relationship but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with and I am grateful to have mine stick with me no matter what."
7," Laughter is important to us all. It keeps smiles on all our faces, even when times get hard.  I had a great grandfather whom we called ""@CAPS1 @PERSON1"". He was the kindest person I'd ever been lucky enough to call a part of my family. He lived next to @LOCATION1, straight across a field, where we could see the @NUM1 of @DATE2 fireworks light up the sky right in our own backyard. I thought that was the coolest thing in the world, and would brag to all my friends about how I had the greatest grandpa ever, just because he lived so close. When I was six years old he had us come down and took us to @LOCATION1, that was the last time I got to see him before he died.  In @DATE3, he died suddenly of a heart attack. We didn't find out for a while after, because he did not live here. His funeral was set for the @NUM2 of @DATE1, a week after we'd found out he had past away, and we planned to attend accordingly. I had went out and bought a nice dress for the funeral because I felt I needed to be dressed up. My mother and sister did the same.  A week had past and we were on our way to @LOCATION2 by plane. I was grounded at the time so I was arrogant about going at all, being away from my friends to go to a sad funeral was not what I wanted to be doing. To make matters worse, my mom was yelling at me the whole ride to my grandpa's house about respect and to remind me that we were doing this because we loved him, and it was important to my family. So, I settled and was quiet as we pulled into the drive-way. Upon entering his home, I was shocked at how many people were there. I realized how much I loved and missed him. Tears began streaming down my face, I walked into the corner of the kitchen, and sat by myself for a while.  Though I had been there before I hadn't seen his whole house. There were rooms full of history and memories of his life. I learned about my family from before my grandparents were even born! It was all so new to me. Then came the sad part of the funeral. At first, no one there seemed sad at all. But, now came the time to look back on his life. I dreaded this part more than anything. Oh, how I longed to be anywhere but there. First up to speak was my grandpa, his adopted son. He had made a spectacular poster, filled with pictures of himself and @CAPS1 @PERSON1. He told the tale of how he came to be his son and how @CAPS1 @PERSON1 was always there for him through thick and thin. Not an eye was dry after my grandpa's speech. I was ready to leave after that, for I could not stand all of the sadness that filled the entire room. Yet, I had to remain seated and listen out of respect for my family. After my grandpa, came one of @CAPS1 @PERSON1's long-time friend/business partners. I expected another story that would make us all begin crying over again, but I was wrong. His speech was of the great life he had lived. According to him, my @CAPS1 @PERSON1 was a bit of a ladies man. Man, what a life he had; girls, money, cars. Things I should have figured out by exploring his home, though, it seemed as if he wasn't gone hearing it from a person who had actually lived it with him. The mood of the whole ceremony turned completely around. There were people laughing and reminiscing the life he had. I learned so many new things about my grandpa that day. Then, after that, the thought of him being gone didn't bring me to tears anymore. In fact, I smiled. I believe that's how my @CAPS1 would've wanted it. Without the humor brought to the remembrance of @CAPS1 @PERSON1; my family would still be mourning over him. We miss him, very much, but I know he wouldn't be happy if we didn't look back and smile upon remembering him as the fun-loving and giving person he was.  "
7," Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."
7," It was one of those days where I just sat around all day doing nothing, but play @PERSON2, text, and laugh at myself. It was one of those days where no one bothered me; no one even really talked to me; no one told me to do chores. By dinner time someone decided to call me up stairs to eat, but let me tell you, it wasn't anything like pizza. Although I'd rather eat it than get a lecture on not being thankful. My brother came home for the first time in ever, ate with us, then decided to leave again. But this time I asked to come with; I'm so tired of beating @PERSON2. He said no, of coarse. I made my daddy change his mind for him, of coarse. I don't see why he wouldn't let me come in the first place. He was going to hang out with the guys I grew up with, my friends, not his. Anyways. I got ready then we hit the road. There him and I were, laughing about dinner and what kind of music my mom listens to, on our way to pick up my friends. These guys are great! All we do is crack jokes about each other and crack up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you this, but it's @DATE1 time, around The @CAPS1 of @DATE2. Fireworks are for sale and we're creating ""bombs"" out of them. Or they are. Since I'm a girl, I guess I'm not allowed, or something lame like that. But there is this girl my brother likes and I guess he wants to impress, excuse me ""impress"" her by showing up at her house so she can see these ""master pieces"" they've made. That just makes me feel bad for him, but honestly just made me laugh. Maybe she'll be impressed. Key word: maybe. Although, no, it won't. Because to this day they are still only friends.  So about these bombs. Complete duds. We tried, well I just watched, over and over again to make 'em work, but they wouldn't do a thing. Eventually my friend @CAPS2 put a whole bunch of @CAPS3 @CAPS4's into my favorite stuffed animal. It just made a bunch of sparkly colors and loud noises, but it was pretty fun to watch. We got in on video too, it was a total good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his ""girl,"" we decided to head home. The thing is, we had so many fireworks left! We know this kid @PERSON3 who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to go by his house, have @CAPS2 get out of the truck, light the firework on his porch, have him jump in the tail of the trunk, then drive off as fast as we could. The first time we did it we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't come out of their house, so we did it again. They still didn't come out. We did it about one more time, by then all the neighbors were out. They were all so confused. That just made us laugh even more. It was so great we wanted to keep doing it, but to someone else this time. We know this girl @PERSON1 who lives near all of us. We thought, why not? It's not gonna hurt to stop there real quick and have some fun with her too. Apparently she thought different. Way different, actually she thought it was the rudest thing ever. We were just joking around, gettin' a laugh out of all our fun. We weren't being rude, she's our friend. Long story short, her mom got mad too and chased us down in her car. She never caught us, but she got our license plate number. The next day, on The @CAPS1 of @DATE2, she called the police. They didn't think it was a big deal, but they still showed up at my house and talked to my parents about what went down. I was at my boyfriend's so lucky me I only had to talk to my mom on the phone about it. She realized we were just having fun and actually laughed about it too. That @CAPS1 of @DATE2 @CAPS8 was great. It was one of those nights where you laughed the whole time and wouldn't change a thing even if you got in trouble with the law for it. Something I will definitely never do again, but I'm so glad I have this hilarious memory to reminisce on for the rest of my life."
7,"                              Laughter @CAPS1 All @CAPS2 minutes had passed and sweat was already dripping down my forehead like a waterfall. I looked calm and ready on the outside, but a storm was flaring up on the inside. I was panicking. With each small footstep, we inched closer and closer to out final destination: The @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It was one of the most fearsome rides in all of @ORGANIZATION1. The cave we were in was dark, gray and cold, lit only by a small amount of electrical torches. The only smell was that of the sweat which continued to pour down my face. I heard lots of chatter from the other masses in line, but I was to nervous to perk my ears up and listen in on their conversations. Quickly, I threw a glance over to my sister, @LOCATION1; my cousin, @PERSON1; and my other cousin, @CAPS5, to see if they were as horrified as I was, but their emotionless, blank faces revealed nothing. Suddenly, on the other side of the cold metal bar separating those who were entering the @CAPS6 cave, and those who were leaving it, came a group of people. Their hair was flung back, like they had just been sucked through a tornado and their faces were drained of color.  ""@CAPS7't ever talk me in to doing something like that again. That was the scariest thing I've ever done!"" the woman frantically said. This only built on to the tower of fear on which I was standing, threatening to collapse at any moment  @CAPS8 minutes had passed. My fear was increasing by the second. Sooner or later, I realized that I would have to conquer my fears and undertake this ride, but I was ill-prepared for whatever horrors awaited me. Suddenly, a gap in the crowd formed. I could not let this window of opportunity slam shut in my face without first getting a sufficient view of what could potentially kill me, so I bent my long legs down and eased my head slightly to the left, trying to get as precise of a view as possible. Two ferocious looking @CAPS4 lay at the end of the cave, their heads facing my direction as if they were staring directly through my skin and into my sole. One dragon was red and the other was blue. Their immensely intimidating jet-black eyes sent a wild shiver through my spine and down to my feet, which were glued to the ground. The spikes that ran all the way down these snake-like @CAPS4 made my body hurt all over, and this was just the result of glancing at them. Just as quickly as it opened, the gap in the line was filled in by the helpless faces in the line.  Finally, I was next in line. The merciless red dragon beckoned me to saddle up and get on its back for the ride of my life. At first I resisted, but it's persuading face overpowered my will to resist. Cautiously, I walked over to the dragon, making sure it would not chomp my arm off. I lowered the over-the-shoulder safety bar over me and quickly tried to reassure myself that I made the right choice. The first thing I noticed was that there was no platform for my feet to rest. Instead, they helplessly dangled off the seat. Unlike any ride I had been on, the tracks were on the top of the ride, not the bottom. After what seemed like hours, the dragon started to move. At first it went slow, as if it were trying to remain hidden to catch its prey but within seconds, it jolted forward causing the juicy burger I had eaten prior to getting in line to drop. I closed my eyes. Unable to see anything, I clung on to the safety bar as if my life depended on it - because it did. Peeking one eye open, I saw that we were about to conquer an upside down loop, but this was nothing compared to what I saw next.  About @NUM1 feet in front of us lay the blue dragon hurdling straight for us, causing my other eye to burst open. Now in clear view, I saw that just before we collided with the ice dragon, both @CAPS4 were thrust up into loops, parallel with each other. Adrenaline began rushing through my veins, and my face involuntarily began to reveal a faint smile which expeditiously transformed into a hysterical laugh. At that moment, at the climax of the duel, I came to the realization that instead of fearing the ride, I should laugh at it.   Laughing even harder, my face turned almost as red as the dragon I was on. My terrifying screams turned into jubilant laughs. By masking and replacing my fear in laughter, I was able to successfully discover that the key of surviving this ride, was laughter. The rest of the ride went by so fast, that I ended up going on it a few more times. That night, I went to bed with a big smile on my face."
7,"Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1,@CAPS2,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM1 words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH1 think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH1 consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it. "
7,"  It was a normal bright and warm @DATE1 day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it.  We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups. She sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My @CAPS1 came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, "" how could she be upset.."" but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my @CAPS1 had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to some one."
7,"The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends.  The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I've ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS3 life and I'll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH1 not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS16 to a close. It was the @CAPS13 last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS2. "
7," It's that amazing feeling in your core, where you feel like you just did two hundred sit-ups. When it sounds like your crying out of control, but you know it's joy. It's laughter. Laughter is one of the best expressions of emotions one can experience. It is an expretion that can be shared with anyone around the world, no matter what lengauge or country. Laughter is a part of everyones life and is essential to a joyful and happy life. Last year, for our eigth grade field trip, many of my friends and I went to the capital of the @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 @CAPS1. One of my bestfriend's name is @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is a very funny and clumsy girl, and deffenetly unique. @CAPS3 kept doing things unintentionally that would just provoce laughter out of everyone. To begin with, @CAPS3 bpards the airplane with a pillow sack to use as a carrie-on because @CAPS3 lacked a proper handbag or suitcase. @CAPS3 had all of her bellongings there, alonmg with two wallets because her mom knew @CAPS3 would lose it, so why not send two?, (@CAPS3 lost her wallet). Upon our arrival at the airport in @LOCATION4, @CAPS3 asked, ""@CAPS4 we in @LOCATION5 yet"", confusing it with the small @ORGANIZATION1 town. Before you know it @CAPS3 had lost her phone which later had to be mailed at her home in @LOCATION3. This is just the first day. One story that sticks in my head is how @CAPS3 was one day wearing a dress on the bus, and drinking an orange soda. SOmehow @CAPS3 managed to spill akk of her drink on her dress, and what does @CAPS3 do? Well, @CAPS3 grabed a bottle of water, and poured it all over herself, as we all watched and wondered why would @CAPS3 do that."
7," Im afraid i dont quite understand, your saying that all i have to do is implement laughter into the story as a part or element of the story? That just seems a little ridiculous to me, after all there could be @CAPS1 of parts/elements in a story. What exactly is the point of even making this one of our choices for a topic. For that matter, how can you even call it a topic? when i looked at this my initial idea was to simply create some story that made laughter play some part in it that was far from integral, but now im just curious. is this the point, you guys give us a bunch of crappy topics to choose from but really the point of it is to get us to find loopholes so the we dont have to be so bland? Or is this an obstacle, giving us topics which have the ability for us to go off on something completly different just so you can fail us. Thats not very nice you know, i dont know how you sleep at night. i can see you people now laughing about how you purposely put things in the test to make kids fail. whats little @PERSON1, who has been diagnosed with A.D.H.D. supposed to do about this? Its not his fault he cant keep his mind on the same subject for more than two seconds, and here you go creating subjects that make normal people stray, you should be ashamed of yourselves! How can you even call yourselves teachers after doing something like this! ""Benefits of Laughter"" @CAPS2! dont make me laugh, the only people that are really laughing are you guys, you sick people, deriving some sort of grotesque pleasure out of other peoples misfortune!"
7,"  I've always heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine"". Ive heard it from many different people in my life. And I believe it's true. The thing that I want most when I'm sad, down, or hurting is to have someone make me laugh and smile. I believe that laughter is the key to happiness and happiness is the key to all relationships. Without laughter, this world would be boring and lifeless.    Whether its a relationship between you and your friends and family, or with the one you hope to get married to someday, happiness should should be a part of it. And the best way to get someone happy is to make them laugh. If you couldn't make your friends laugh, then how would you be able to create such good, fun memories in your life? And what if you couldn't make your boyfriend or girlfriend laugh? You wouldn't really be able get along very well. So the most important part in a relationship is being happy with each other.  Relationships have to be full of laughter in order to work out. How are you supposed to get along with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you can't laugh and have fun together? That's why laughter is so important in relationships. Without it, some relationships wouldn't work out. Making the person you love laugh or even giggle is truly an amazing feeling. I believe that laughter is a type of bond in a relationship. After you make him or her laugh you feel a type of connection with them.    When someone's down and gloomy, the best way to brighten up there day is to do or say something funny. As soon as they laugh, a smile will be put on their face. After you make someone laugh, you're not only cheering them up, you're also giving them a better day. Instead of ignoring them and letting them stay gloomy, making them laugh will make them happier and make them believe that someone cares enough to cheer them up. They will remember you as a caring person who gave them a better day and made them laugh. You don't have to believe this, but I do. I beleive that laughter is the best medicine.  "
7," @DATE1 twentieth was a hot day, my family an I had decided that we wanted to go to the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 for my birthday, so I invited everyone I wanted to go, even my parents invited some people so they wouldn't be stuck with a bunch of sixteen and seventeen year old. At eight @CAPS1 we had packed five cars full of people and four ice coolers full of food to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and oh my gosh that day was so much fun, but it seemed like it took for ever but we kept our selves entertained @CAPS14 the way there. The night before my dad (@CAPS4) said that we are leaving at eight thirty @CAPS1 no matter what, and let me tell @CAPS9 when my dad says were leaving at a certain time we leave at that time and not a second later or we end up having to listen to him complain and yell about not leaving at the right time. Everyone went to bed early that night so we wouldn't have any problems in the morning getting up but of course I wake up to my little brother and my dad arguing because he doesn't want to get up and and he doesn't want to go, what a way to wake up for my birthday right? After all the fighting stopped my brother (little @CAPS4) got out of bed and got ready to go to the @CAPS3 and he helped put everything in the car. My dad decided he wanted to ride his motorcycle to the @CAPS3 so he called up some of his friends and said that he wanted to ride so they had to because he is the president of theFreebird motorcycle club and his @CAPS5 president said ""alright lets ride"" anyone in the club that was going had to ride there motorcycle or they had to pay @MONEY1 to the club because that is the club rule. At seven thirty all of my friends started showing up my dad didn't really understand @CAPS6 many people I had invited it was my sixteenth birthday I had to @CAPS10 a lot of people. He started getting frustrated and yelling saying ""@CAPS6 MANY @CAPS7 PEOPLE @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11!!!"" I said only like ten or eleven maybe twelve people its not that many dad. Well good thing for me only eight people showed up. I was sad but I was very happy that I didn't have to cram a bunch of people in our car and listen to my dad yell. At eight thirty we left my house headed to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  I had brought a lot of @CAPS12's to listen to because we had an hour and half long drive till we got to the @CAPS3, @CAPS14 one of my @CAPS12's I have this song its calledI'm @CAPS14 A @CAPS15 and there is a lot of cussing in this song, my mom turn's it up and starts singing to it all my friends started cracking up laughing because they are listening to a forty year old woman sing this song, I swear it's like she could have been our age at the time. Half way threw the song we all started singing and then we all laughed so hard that by the time we got to the @CAPS3 we all had to pee. At ten @CAPS1 we arrived at the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 and they were a lot of people there. I was so excited because not a lot of my friends have been to the @CAPS3 and it amazing there.  When @CAPS9 first get to the @CAPS3 in the morning its not hot enough to get into the @CAPS2 yet so me and all of my friends sat in the sun soaking it all up so we would get hot enough to jump off the @CAPS2 fall, or @CAPS9 can slide. My best friend at the time decided she was going to be the first brave one to slide in, ha she slid down the slide @CAPS14 her but and i forget to tell her that @CAPS9 have a chance of ripping your bathing suit bottoms, whoops she @CAPS8 she didn't even notice but when she came out from the waterfall she had a huge hole in the butt of her bathing suit. We all started laughing so hard her face turned bright red and then she was so embarrassed that she pushed us in the @CAPS2.  My parents had a great time and so @CAPS8 I. My family laughs a lot by the end of the day everyone cheeks hurt from laughing. Witch made everyone laugh even harder. By the time i had got home my cheeks hurt so bad i felt like they were just going to fall off. ha, but my parents and my friends all had a good time and that's all that matters to me, that was the best sixteenth birthday party ever, and i hope that my seventeenth is even better. "
7,"                                  ""@CAPS1 @DATE1"" @CAPS2 my brother graduated @CAPS1 year it was a great time in our lives . We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.  "
7," He laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day. It was just after @DATE1 and @PERSON2 and I had just fixed our off and on relationship. He had picked @CAPS1 up from my house so we could hangout at his. He had seemed upset since he had picked @CAPS1 up which was completely out of the norm for him. He was always smiling or laughing and had some funny story to tell @CAPS1, but not today. Today he was quite, we had been together for about two hours already and he'd said all of about a sentence to @CAPS1 and I had only gotten one of those lame half smiles that really meant ""I'm not in the mood so just stop"".  We were watchingDespicable @CAPS1 for about the third time when the yelling started, he was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just started shouting, his voice was followed by a higher softer voice yelling back, it was @PERSON2's step mom. The were arguing about cheating or drinking or staying out to late, I really don't remember, I couldn't hear to well and I was paying attention to @PERSON2 to watch for his reaction. He stood where he was for a couple minutes just staring straight in front of him, he looked like he was going to cry. Then he slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them and put his head on his arms, for a second I thought he was crying. My big tough guy who didn't ever deal with anyone's crap looked as hurt and helpless as he could get, he looked more helpless then I felt. I mean what could I do, I had no idea whether he would want to be left alone or if he'd want someone to hug him and make him feel better so I sat where I was, on his bed, leaning against the wall just looking at him hoping he do something to help @CAPS1 decide what would help him feel better. In the living room his parents were still screaming and yelling at one another when another voice joined in, it was his step mom's friend, @PERSON1. She was trying to stop them from fighting, trying to help but @PERSON2's dad, @PERSON3, wasn't one to interrupt, when he was mad you simply stayed out of his way. @PERSON1 had made a mistake. Suddenly there was a crash, @PERSON2 jumped, and the sound of cupboards being slammed and glass being broken, the only statement I could make out was ""that was your grandma's, your mom is gonna be pissed!"" from @PERSON2's step mom. @PERSON2 got up, walked over to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a second with his forehead against the door then he turned and walked over to @CAPS1, he laid @CAPS1 down and cuddled with @CAPS1.   There was more shouting now, something about food, cars, and getting all of someones crap out of the house. There was the sound of food being thrown, then a door slamming and tires screeching. Finally they were done. @PERSON3 was leaving too, you could tell by the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone, @PERSON2 finally looked at @CAPS1, I could tell he was sad, he still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated the fighting and that's when I realized that's what had been wrong with him all day, they had been fighting like this all week, they were getting divorced. It wasn't the first divorce he had been through either, that was his dads third wife that had just walked out the door.   ""@CAPS2, that's hell and really scary. Promise @CAPS1 WE will @CAPS3 fight like that?"" I said. I had @CAPS3 heard anyone fight like that and frankly it scared @CAPS1, I would @CAPS3 want that kind of thing going on in my house.  ""I promise.""he smiled.  I kissed him on the nose and went to get up but he pulled @CAPS1 back down and kissed my nosed, I looked at him and smiled "" @CAPS4, I really really gotta pee."" That was all it took, he laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day."
7,"  Dozey off into space, relaxed as I could be in a hot stuffy room. @CAPS1 is laying next to me, both thinking of things we could do. Nothing is coming to mind. We both decided that it was to hot do anything outside, and nothing was on tv. We thought we were just going to be laying in bed all day, roting away in the heat. But then @CAPS1 comes up with this idea to play some video games. @CAPS6 we turn up some music, blast the streo. Put in some @CAPS2 Of @CAPS3 and start killing people. @CAPS6 were killing people, whipping butt if i could say. Then @CAPS1 says ""@CAPS5 im getting really tired, plus it's gettig really warm."" @CAPS6 then i try fixing the ac. @CAPS6 im working on the the ac and are is just laying in bed. Time went bye, seems like it was taking forever for the day to end. We had nothing to do. We were stuck. Then @CAPS1 started telling me a joke. I was a chessy one but it still made me laugh. @CAPS6 here were sitting on her bed telling each other some jokes to pass time away. After awile the jokes get old, now were sitting on her bed again. Falling asleep because there's nothing else we can do. Music is off, window is open, @CAPS6 all you can hear is the cars driving by one the street. Out of no where @CAPS1 farts, and it wa snot no girly fart. It was loud and stinky. Right away I start to laugh. While she is getting enbarested, I don't remeber why but then I farted to. She started to crack up laughing. Her face was truning red. @CAPS6 we both started farting back and forth, reminder we were in the sixth grade. But nothing was as funny as it was when what is bpout to happen in my life. It's @CAPS1's turn to fart, and she is getting all ready than she farts. But this was not like any other one! She stopped laughing right away, looked at me with a frown on her poor little face and said""@CAPS10 i think i just pooped my pants!"" I started laughing @CAPS6 freking hard, i started to cry. IT was that bad. You could smell it to. @CAPS6 she starting walking to the bathroom, and all i hear is ""@CAPS10 i just pooped my freking pants!!"" "
7,"Laughter can create this type of bond that's hard to sever. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the same things. Its an amazing thing when people laugh. It doesn't always make sense or seem that funny at the time but it will make anyone I think feel better no matter what the circumstance. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the somethings. Or how laughter can fix a fight that you and a love one have had. Well here it goes, my story of a very true and very close to home story that help me open my mind and have one of the best and true friends I well ever have in my life. To tell this story i have to go back in time to when i way around nine or so. When I was a young girl my sister, @CAPS1, or as I always called her @PERSON2, and me hated each other. We never got along, maybe that's because of sharing a room with a older sister, but i can remember her never wanting to play with me or hang out with me. My oldest sister @PERSON1 had just gone to collage so my sister @PERSON2 and me got the chance to get to know each other a whole lot more. Sure we still had fights and still didn't get along with each other very well, but we were well on are way to becoming the best friends we are today. Well one day when my parents went out shopping me and my sister @PERSON2 stayed home to clean the house. Well in my family when cleaning music is blasting no matter what kind it is. As always my big sister had to ""order"" me around, or at least that's what it felt like then, and like always i was a stubborn little sister who never liked taking orders from the big sister. Well @PERSON2 told me i had to clean the bathrooms, and I hate to clean bathrooms, I mean who does right? So I tell her that wouldn't do clean them...well that doesn't go over so well with the big sister who is charge while mom and dad are away. So we start to fight, and oh what a fight that was. I mean loud as loud can be. The music couldn't even be heard over the yelling and screaming. Like most fighting in my house goes, my sister and I go so feed up with each other that we stormed out of that room and into our own bedrooms. While the music was still blasting and even could be heard from all the way upstairs. So as I ,and I can only guess my sister was doing the same, was plotting my revenge on my oh so ""wise"" sister then music changed to a upbeat classic song that is one of the most popular songs in my house hold. This song was ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", because I loved this song so much I opened my door to my bedroom. I guess my sister is like me because she did the same. Well I had started singing and dancing in my room to the music, and guess my sister had heard me because she had come out of her room and into mine. I of course didn't notice her so I had keep doing my singing and dancing. Well as soon as she started to laugh at me I stop and glared at her. @CAPS1 just stands there laughing, I had said something on the lines as well you couldn't do better then that. So she tried and it was my turn to laugh. We ended up making fun of each others dances and laughed all the way down stairs were we hug and said how sorry and stupid we where for fighting. Then after all that had just happened we look around us at the work to still be done. We then looked at each other and laughed and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home. We finish just in time to, as soon as my mom and dad came home we where just doing the last bit of cleaning. @TIME1 after my mom and my dad had gone to bed my sister and I had a @TIME1 of watching movies and laughing our heads off.  That's it, my story of how sisters, or more like best friends can fix and start anything with just laughing and having fun together. Now my sister lives in @LOCATION1 so i don't see her a lot, but when ever i can i web chat her or call her. We spend hours laughing, it doesn't even matter what we are laughing about. That's what laughter does, it creates this bond, a deep connection. My sister and I @MONTH1 have had our fights in the past...and the future but we have laughter that always helps us stay together no matter what happens in life."
7," Like many @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 students I have always viewed test taking is a rather stressful time. The @TIME2 study sessions and the fact that many tests can make or break your grade in a class are likely, inevitable, reasons for stress. While most students stress and study then stress and study some more I've found a very effective way to rid myself of the inconvenience of stress, which is simply put to laugh.  All students enrolled in @CAPS1-calculus at @ORGANIZATION1 must learn and be able to recite about @NUM1 trigonomic identities, and I am no exception. Due to a rather poor grade point average last semester I know that @TIME1 semester I need to do exceptionally well in @ORGANIZATION1 if I want to hold a job outside of pumping gas. So like many @CAPS1-@CAPS2 students I stayed up long past when the sun fell writing and trying to commit @CAPS3 identities into my memory for the test today. Needless to say I was a little stressed. As time passed by @TIME1 my anxiety level was exponentially increasing. Then the time had come, the test was in my hands. I felt somewhat confident that I knew what the reciprocal of co-secant was so I lowered my pencil to the paper. Only to be interrupted. A wave of relief consumed my body as I realized my named was called to be excused from class, meaning I was granted more time to study. Unfortunately I the note read ""please send student immediately to @NUM2 for state testing. Thank @CAPS4"". Now I was worried about @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and state testing. On the walk to the testing room I could not rid myself of thoughts about failing both my tests and not being able to the come up with money to repair my car that I almost totaled last @DATE1 and the wall that I damaged as well. I opened the door to @NUM2, and needless to say I was more than a little stressed. Then I read one of the worst test prompt's I have ever seen. Making a claim about how ""We all Understand..."". That's a pretty bold claim, saying that everyone understands something. I would go as far as to say it's just wrong, we all don't understand the benefits laughter. I have no clue what all the physical benefits of laughter are and I doubt @CAPS4 do either. Sitting in my chair I couldn't help but start to grin. Then it got even better. The prompt then quoted ""someone"". A state issued test derived a prompt off of a quote from ""someone"" then preceded to ask students to tell a true story. Then I laughed harder then I had laughed in a long time. I laughed until the thoughts of owning people thousands of dollars and working at a gas station all my life because I failed at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 stopped haunting me. Then I proceeded to write one of the dumbest essays I have ever wrote on one of the dumbest prompts I have ever seen."
7," Have you ever experienced a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard your stomach hurt, and your eyes were filled with tears? Laughing is something every person needs. A great laugh can make a persons day and put a smile on their face. If no one laughed the world would be a terribly sad place.  My friends and I are always laughing, to the point where were rolling on the ground, clutching our stomachs laughing. We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing. I honestly don't know who I'd be if I didn't laugh, or what I would become. I remember this one time when my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, and I were having a off day. We all woke up in bad moods and everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen banging pans and pots around. When we woke up our favorite cereal was gone and so we wanted to go to the donut shop but no one would take us, and even though I realize that's not the end of the world now, it seemed like it then. My brother and sisters, with the @LOCATION1 blasting and running around the house yelling, were irritating us and we were already mad. The dog and cats, who kept trying to keep sneak in the house, were annoying us too. The weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing. We were all ready done with the day before it had even started.  We eventually decided to get up and get ready. We came up with a plan to walk down to river behind my house even in the poor weather. The river was after our big backyard and past the quad track so it was about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river she said no she didn't want us walking down there by ourselves, which we had already done a few times before. We begged until we knew she wasn't going to let us. That put us yet again in a foul mood. We had to go find something new to do and it didn't seem like there was many options. We lived clear out of town about @NUM1 miles, not exactly walking distance."
7,"I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE1 and how ""high"" or ""drunk"" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important."
7,"Goodbye, @CAPS1 ""@CAPS2's not goodbye forever, @CAPS18's just taking a long trip,"" I told myself as the family approached the rental minivan. The part of myself that was functionally untouched by @CAPS6 strong emotions that day focused on dragging millstone feet down the picturesque cement pathway. The still noon sun seemed to tumble at an exponential rate towards sunset--towards the last moment of contact with @CAPS6 @CAPS1 for the next few months. @CAPS2 was only minutes away. The past few days of @ORGANIZATION1 touring accorded with the weather and mood: fresh @DATE1 breezes of delicious @ORGANIZATION2, blue skies of toasted @CAPS3 @CAPS4, exhilarating moments of biting into a greasy breakfast sausage, and the continuous presence of family like the trickle of chocolate milk down @CAPS6 throat. I had lived like a king. Now came the purpose we had flown to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, and all of us were at a loss for words. How hard can the simple ""goodbye"" be!? That morning, we had arrived on campus eager to play some last games and defer the ""goodbyes."" I had personally hoped to be under time pressure because of the flight, and rush @CAPS6 way through the final moments. @CAPS2 wasn't something I wanted to remember. We brothers wandered the campus on a tour from @CAPS6 dad, who had attended @PERSON1. His entire family were @PERSON1 alumni, and now @PERSON3 on his way. @CAPS18 spoke as the university professor @CAPS18 is, entertaining us almost to the point where our minds weren't on @PERSON3. Never the less, our eyes flitted across the lawns toward the chapel occasionally. Was @CAPS2 a figment of @CAPS6 imagination, or did @CAPS6 dad also turn his head? Either @CAPS18 was very good at concealing his emotions or @CAPS18 had vetoed them out of practicality. I remember him saying, ""@CAPS5 your mother and I got married, we agreed to not let emotions rule our decisions."" @CAPS6 nine-year-old @CAPS1, @PERSON4, was oblivious to the entire situation--searching for acorns to pelt me with. @CAPS6 despicable twelve-year-old @CAPS1 @PERSON2 was ruining the situation as usual, obviously implying how monumental the situation was with pride of his understanding. I was the opposite, obscure in perfect silence and lack of body language. I am an experienced practitioner of this method. Because of the divide in attention, the tour ended abruptly. We sneaked around the chapel and played word games. All our words revolved around the elephant in the room. We didn't notice the swarm of tall @CAPS7 boys emerging from the chapel until they almost ran us over. We scurried off the path, and they marched up the hill in quiet or no conversation. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 tailed slightly with a @CAPS8 and a @CAPS9 friend of his. Out of politeness towards the @CAPS8, they spoke mostly @CAPS11--@CAPS6 @CAPS1 insecure and the @CAPS9 struggling badly. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 only knew enough so that @CAPS18 and I @CAPS14 converse topics in solidarity. @PERSON3 strolled over with his friends, introduced them, and then they continued into the dormitories. The four of us strolled down the paths with @PERSON3, mostly asking natural questions and behaving normally. The previous tension was relieved, but also increasing as we wound our way towards the parking lot. A few minutes later, the car was in sight. In the panic of seeing the car, I ""casually"" halted to watch two students play a game of volleyball. I didn't fool anybody, so in desperation I fished a horrendously stupid question out of nowhere: ""@CAPS13 you have a specific plan for work @CAPS23 graduate school?"" @CAPS14 I have chosen worse? @PERSON3 explained that @PERSON1 was famous locally and internationally, but not nationally. @CAPS18 was likely to either stay in the area or move to @LOCATION4, probably study his @CAPS15 year in @LOCATION3. The volleyball match ended shortly, so by the time @CAPS18 was finished on the subject we @CAPS14 see our mom in the driver's seat of the rental. She is a petite woman, about @NUM1 pounds and five feet, four inches tall. She was staring at us--probably @PERSON3--displaying something between shock and fear. Though we all knew that we would give him goodbye hugs, we buckled. @PERSON3 stood patiently outside the van with @CAPS6 dad. @CAPS6 dad leaned over, whispered something in @LOCATION2's ear, and took the driver's seat. @PERSON3 leaned in, gave a somewhat humorous goodbye to each of us as we unbuckled to lean into the hug. To me @CAPS18 whispered, ""@CAPS16 todo que hemos vivido."" (@CAPS11 for ""For everything we have lived."") @CAPS18 gave me a tight hug around the shoulders, chin squeezing one of them comfortably. @CAPS6 mom's was a long hug, with her head sideways against his still chest. We all saw her quiet tears begin to trickle. She stuttered, ""@CAPS19 vertraue @CAPS20 zuruck zu @CAPS21,"" meaning ""I trust you back to @CAPS22."" @CAPS23 considering if @CAPS2 was appropriate, I revived the trump joke from breakfast, ""I trust you with @CAPS6 breakfast sausages."" The sporadic laughter mixed with tears gave new-found love to the departure. Now @CAPS2 is the core of the memory."
7,"@CAPS1 as long as you breathe, love as long as you live. @CAPS2 was impossible, there was absolutely no way @CAPS2 could be real. Breathing seemed virtually unachievable, as if I was choking on air. Everything around me blurred, spinning viciously as I clung to the fresh cut grass. Tears diluted the burn in my eyes, but not the sting in my nose, though neither caused my body to tremble as @CAPS2 did. Attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone @CAPS8 helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to @CAPS7. My best friend stood @CAPS8 watched as I grew more violent, pounding the dew soaked lawn with my fists, whimpers transforming into shrieks. A door slammed behind me @CAPS8 I felt the arms of my father, trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest in more of an attempt to silence my obnoxious wailing rather than comfort me. He apologized repeatedly, I imagine he didn't know what else to @CAPS7. @CAPS2 was too early for the In a better place"" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, @PERSON2 trailing close behind. Sitting on my bed @CAPS2 seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was over-whelmed by the feeling I was missing something, like he was closer than I knew. I sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. He @CAPS8 his ""stunna-shades"" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief @CAPS8 frustration, he didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face he'd say, ""@CAPS3 on, suck @CAPS2 up @CAPS8 take @CAPS2 like a man!"" I knew in my heart he wanted me to be with the people he loved @CAPS8 he wanted us to be smiling. With the morning sun beating on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Reaching her front porch, I realized immediately the time I was about to spend in that house, would be like none before. When I let myself in as I always did @CAPS6 peered around the corner, eyes swollen @CAPS8 discolored. I took four steps forward @CAPS8 met her with a tearful embrace, in which I apprehended @CAPS6 wished I was him. @CAPS6 loved him in a way I'd never fathomed, but the desperate longing to be held by a loved one, I knew all too well. We cried @CAPS8 held each other because there was nothing more we could @CAPS7. When there was a pause in the sobs @CAPS8 @PERSON3 actually looked at me for the first time, noticing I looked just as terrible as @CAPS6 did. I reached into my pocket @CAPS8 pulled out his sunglasses. @CAPS2 was hard not be selfish at a time where all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to @CAPS7. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew @CAPS2 was my next step. Her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5."" @CAPS6 started weeping once more, I held her @CAPS8 tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, tear stained @CAPS8 reddened as well. I smiled at them gently. They all took notice to the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand, they hadn't know him the way @CAPS6 @CAPS8 I did. We spent the day gathered around with a loss of words @CAPS8 hunger, our pizza sat untouched, the television on just to break the silence. No one said much, about anything. ""@CAPS7 you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?"" I felt the question @CAPS3 up like vomit, too large to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I feared I spoke too soon, I began to assume all of the melancholy @CAPS8 crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted for longer than @CAPS2 had. @PERSON3 smiled @CAPS8 nodded to my relief. ""@CAPS8 you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles."" I laughed aloud, I couldn't help @CAPS2. I was flooded by the memory of him trying to act confused as to why the boiling water had cashews floating on top. ""@CAPS7 you remember how he'd always braid your hair?"" @PERSON3 smiled even greater.  The rest of that month was filled to the brim with tears, but @CAPS2 overflowed with laughter. When @PERSON1 died, laughing was the last thing I wanted to @CAPS7. @PERSON1 always generated the larger portion of my laughter, @CAPS8 with him gone I never imagined I would @CAPS1 again. But in reality, just because he left too soon doesn't mean the laughter did. My beatitude in his memory will never die."""
7," A moment that laughter made everything better was when I was with my cousin @CAPS1, in @LOCATION1. He is going off to the @CAPS2 pretty soon, so spending time together was the main goal. @CAPS1 and I have a a close bond, we talk as much as we can through the phone. This trip meant a lot to both @CAPS1 and I, we don't know how long it's going to be until we see each other again. Every laughter, and smile was something that we will always remember.  My parents and I went to @LOCATION1 for @CAPS4. In @LOCATION1 I met up with my cousins, since my parents seemed to be busy all the time. Of course when there is a group of teenagers, well it's going to be loud. I remember- on our @DATE1 in @LOCATION1- my cousins and I got lost in the town we stayed. Now let me say in that town there is no way someone can get lost, it's so small. So when we got lost, we found it so funny and unbelievable that we got lost. Fortunately it was during the @DATE1, it wasn't too scary. My cousins and I say it wasn't our fault, we blame the taxi driver for not listening to our directions. Because it was such a funny mess, we didn't stop laughing until we got to our destination. In the car all three of us were argued where to go and what turn to take, while the taxi driver just listened and laughed at us. It was so embarrasing, niether of us wanted to see that taxi driver again. @CAPS1 is older and way more taller than me, he was the tallest person in town. Now @CAPS1 is always talking about how he is not afraid of anything and that he is so brave. Until one night all of that was forgotten while @CAPS1 spent the @TIME1. I shared a room with my two other cousins and @CAPS1 stayed in the room next to ours with my brother. It was about @TIME1, when we all went to bed. Out of nowhere we hear a weird noise outside our room. The next thing I hear is @CAPS1 yelling in the other room, wanting to come sleep with us. I was scared also, so my cousins and I decided to let him come in. I turned on the light while @CAPS1 and my brother were coming inside the room. My brother @PERSON3 came in with all the blankets and pillows, while @CAPS1 came in with the airbed. It was such a funny sight so we all started laughing. @CAPS1 said "" I @MONTH1 be big and tall but I get scared easily"", that made us laugh even more. The noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street. I remember this moment so clearly in my head since it concluded our entire vacation with each other as family. While my parents and grandparents were out in the front lawn with all the guest. My cousins, @PERSON3 and I were in my room- like always the funny moments happened in my room- we were just bored and didn't know what to do. Slowly I was beginning to fall asleep on top of a suitcase. All of a sudden my cousin @PERSON1 comes up with this crazy idea of how I can fit in a suitcase. I thought she was kidding, but when I looked up to see everyone's face, I knew they were serious. So here I am opening a suitcase, taking everything out meanwhile @CAPS1 goes and gets his camera. The next thing I know I'm getting inside the suitcase. I'm no acrobat, nor am I really flexible, so when I notice that I am having no trouble getting inside the suitcase, I freak out. My brother is practically peeing his pants from laughing so hard, my cousins are just baffled at what they were witnessing. When it came to zipping up the suitcase, I told them that was to far, but they convinced me to zip up the zipper so they could roll me around. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 my brother and my third cousin @PERSON2 all took turns rolling me around. They kept saying on how we should go out in the front lawn and surprise my parents. I came out of the suitcase- I felt so dizzy- after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor. We laughed and made jokes on how tiny I am as well as how much fun it was after I felt a little better. Since then @CAPS1 calls me ""@CAPS13"". Saying goodbye to everyone was hard, but saying goodbye to my cousin @CAPS1 was even harder. Knowing that I won't see him in a long time is unbearable. @CAPS1 and I have a strong bond, and I see him like a brother. In our entire trip, neither of us could speak of him going, instead we chose to just have fun and ignore the pain. Laughing made that pain go away. It made our trip worth going.  "
7," @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together."
7," So the story starts off with my family and I in @LOCATION1 for my grandparents anniversary we are at the house that we always go to over the @DATE1 but this was a really fun year because my cousins that i dont see a lot where there to and my and one of my cousins get into a lot of trouble when ever we are together. So while we where hanging out we always just go swim go back to the house and eat then go back and swim the water is so cold when you go into it for the first time which i never forget. so thats what we do for about a week and then we started going out to eat alot and my grandparents did not know that my parents and my cousins parents where making plans for us to go out to eat for dinner where my grandparents good friends where and so it was the day of the dinner and all the kids knew about it and tryed not to tell my grandparents about it until they saw who was there. so when we got to the party my cousin was looking around and saw a cake and it had my grandma and grandads faces on it. he told me that he was going to eat my grandpas face. so after we eat and got down talking my grandparents cut the cake and my cousin shouts out "" I get to eat grandads face"" and every one just started laughting. So the party went on after the cake was cut. me and my cousin asked are parents if we could have red bulls but they did not let us. But the party wa still fun and I still remember that and will never forget it "
7,"The funny and @CAPS1 things about forest camp. One thing I've learned personally from this experience is that some things are funnier than meets the eye. During the sixth grade when I was in middle school my class and I went on a week long trip to forest camp which was basically an outdoors school. It was being held at a camp that was usually open during the @DATE1 called camp @CAPS2.The day before I had to pack a lot of things including closes supplies and a little food. When my class and I got on the bus we were totally stoked to go to forest camp but we didn't want to have to go on a hour and a half bus ride to get there at all. A bunch of my friends including me as well just decided to sleep during the whole ride over there.We left the school around eight o'clock in the morning and when we got to forest camp it was about nine thirty in the morning I think. After a moment or two everybody started to waked up and get excited. When we got off the bus we were assigned to our cabins and out camp councilors who would be there supervising us and making sure that we didn't do anything really stupid. My teacher @PERSON1 was a really cool teacher who was always into having a good time and trying to make learning as fun as possible. The main reason we were there in the first place was to learn about a lot of different types of science. Most of my friends weren't exacting interested in this prospect but it was a lot better than just sitting in a class room do regular stuff. after everybody got unpacked we were allowed to go play a bunch of games of baseball, soccer and football with like thirty players on each team. It was sweet but the best of best was short to come tonight. We were just getting to know everybody from the different schools and life seemed easy at the time but things were about to get complicated. All of the councilors and the two lead counselors had a special surprise for all of us. They wanted us to dance, it seemed really annoying when I think back to that @TIME1 but I'm really glad I did because for one I had a good time, for two I learned how to dance, and for three I got one heck of a work out doing it.  After all of the dancing, laughing and poking fun at people who danced really funny, the councilors and all of the teachers said it was time to go to bed. So we did our regular prep ups for tomorrow and got into bed, but little did they know that when you put twelve thirteen year old boys in the same room trying to get some sleep your asking for some trouble. It seemed like nobody wanted to get any sleep at all, they just seemed to want to goof off and act lie monkeys, but I myself have very little room to talk because I hate to say it but I was one of those little monkeys talking yelling and throwing pillows at my friends and having a great time. We told stories about ourselves and cracked jokes and not to mention all of us were going to have to be limping through camp the next morning because of our ribs hurting so bad from all of the hilarious stuff we were laughing at. The funniest thing of all the next morning was that none of the kids looked like they got a good nights sleep. The councilors looked the funniest though because they looked like they just ran the eight hundred meter because they were all trying to get all of the campers to go to bed @TIME1. It was awesome because what we were going to do @DATE2 was canceled and instead we were going to make a skit of what exactly happened @TIME1 in our cabins. I think my groups skit was the best of them all personally. All of the skits were based on the same basis as our, all of the kids didn't want to go to bed. All they wanted to do was everything else. Every skit was unique in its own way but they were all really hilarious. I had just realized that the fun was just getting started and that I had four more days at forest camp with all sorts of things to do. I thought to myself and said that that was pretty @CAPS1. I really now know that things are a lot funnier than meets the eye."
7,"                                 @CAPS2 @CAPS1      The first time i ever heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 started to talk to everyone that was new to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in @CAPS2 @CAPS1 without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.    "
7," Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE1 laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1.  Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of around @NUM1 people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH1 not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION1 decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION1 is somewhat of a @CAPS4 of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION1 member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!"
7," Lets get to the understanding of laughter. All of us should understand the benefit of laughter. For example, someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 many others would have to agree that laughter is an important part in any relationship. And if your someone to dwell over the word of someone else on a topic that has nothing to do with those people, then get a life. We all can agree relationships get complicated at times. People @MONTH1 think laughter is the least important thing in a relationship. When yes that's good but at times that is also a bad thing. A relationship with little to no laughter incorporated is to me a waist of time. And a relationship with too much laughter incorporated then u mine as well call it a friendship instead of a relationship. So what I am getting at is that, laughter can either make or brake any kind of relationship if you don't be careful.  So for example ill tell you something about my relationship now and my past relationships that laughter had an effect on. The relationship i am in now. Well, me and my girlfriends first attraction to each other had to of been laughter. Laughter was is what got us to be what we are. But then we also had to be able to have those serious times and commitment. They were basically balanced out between natural attraction, to attraction with laughter. And that is why I believe that there has been no rough patches or any major ones at that.  Now lets take some attention to some past relationships. There was this one, were all it was lasted on was laughter. That's all we had to do is laugh when it came time to see each other or anything. Shortly after we had got together the laughter had eventually stop and we noticed none of us knew anything about each other. Then of course it ended. And then some focus on one other. We had little to no laughter at all in our relationship. All we had talked about was ourselves, and once it came down to it that we knew everything or at least most of each other. there was absolutely nothing to talk about at all. And what do u know it ended badly.  I got pretty much nothing else to say but save yourself the trouble, make sure you can have your laughs and serious times with good communication. Without that then i doubt any relationship will last, but that's up to you. If u find your own way, then good for you."
7,"                                      A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The @CAPS3  Many people believe laughter is a vital element in a relationship and I agree. In my case laughter is @CAPS1.A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 silence. A silence that scars not only my mind but my relationship with my beloved father. A silence so dramatically insulting it makes me doubt whether the person to whom I adore is still living in the standing figure I presently have before me. Laughter is our salvation. In the beautiful @DATE1 mornings, when I was a toddler , the ritual of the weekends began. As the clock silently mermered @NUM1 a.m I would navigate through the sea of animal imprinted blankets and dive for the camouflage of my bear blanky. Immediately, crawling as quietly as a @CAPS4 into the spy infested hall. My force field would protect me @CAPS2 attracting any attention toward my direction, so I could accomplish my onerous objective, to scare my father. Finally, I reached the grant room. There he was sleeping, or as many would have already guessed, pretend sleeping. The sound of my tiny feet stumbling on my camouflage blanket always awakened my father. As I sound next to the queens size bed waiting for the perfect moment to attack father would always, at the last minute, raise his left arm. This would leave me in sear astonishment. How could it be, after all my efforts he still manged to hear me? As any toddler would, I would make a fuss before giving into his welcoming jester. Usually, a an inviting cracked smile @CAPS2 my father would make me forgive. I would lay my minuscule body next to his massive body and begin the breathing game. While father tried to to regain his inner peace I, began to exhale and inhale simultaneously with father. I inhaled and would wait for my father to exhale. My lungs sterived for oxygen; yet, I did not dare to breath. My nose began to fall into the temptation of secretly inhaling. To my releaf an exhale form my father would always release me @CAPS2 my torture game. Pretty soon the game would come to an end after I impatiently fought through the exhales and inhales. In the end, father would always notice my inpatients. He would get up, wrapped his mammoth arms around me, and carry me toward the kitchen for my morning chocolate. There we would share our plans for the day.  Presently, when I awaken @CAPS2 my slumber there is no sea of animal imprinted blankets to navigate through, as they have been replaced with gold bed sheets. The ritual of the weekends that once enveloped me with happiness has diminished. The hall way that once anticipated a toddler every morning , now only excepts , in annoyance , that there is no longer a weekends ritual ; only a immature teenager passing through every morning, leaving behind the toddler there had once been. All together, the morning bounding has deseaced. All connection has been buried deep within both of us. It seems that laughter is the only action left that can unbury those ""lost"" emotions. Laughter is one emotion father and I share. When father and I laugh for what ever the reason the connection of father and daughter is restored. It makes us feel like we are back to the days where nothing kept us @CAPS2 being us with each other. The scars vanish and all that remains is us; the figure is reviled. It is my daddy. It is as if the autopilot has been turned off and we can regain control of our emotions. This is a time when what I say to him truly comes @CAPS2 within my @CAPS3, but when the moment has passed autopilot switches to ""on"". The silence that once controlled our being has once again sent one of its dark clouds to silence the @CAPS3 of both of us. The vanished scars reappear as open wounds. Every emotion that was felt in that moment becomes part of the past. The curse of our daily lives has once again begun."
7,"I'm going to tell my reader a true story about the day I had a big laugh with my brother.  First I was getting ready to go outside to ride a motorcycle than my little nephew and brother saw me so they wanted to come with me. I left outside with them I went for one of the motorcycle I got them on and I was holding my nephew from the back so he fall. Then we were just going around the house for a little while, so we got bored then we headed tours the road so than we were riding around. It was really fun and later my brother came out and he was getting ready to get on the motorcycle and he headed to the road with us, and we were just outside riding our motorcycles. Second of all, my mom came out she told us to go inside because we were going to eat so we left and ate we waited for a little while, I left outside with my brothers and my little nephew so we got on the motorcycles and headed to the road my little brother was going fast and I was holding on to my little nephew and I kept on telling him to slow down because he was going to drop our nephew, but he still didn't listen so I took my nephew off the motorcycle and he started to cry so I had to put him back on the motorcycle so he can stop crying then my other brother came and got mad because our little brother kept going really fast so he slapped him in the back so he can slow down, but still wouldn't slow down so he left really fast and he called @PERSON1 a bad name he was trying to catch, but he had his motorcycle off and he couldn't turn it on and he looked really funny cause he didn't have a shirt on just a blanket and when he was trying to turn on the motorcycle the blanket would go back and it looked like if he was trying to fly but with one hand and I just kept on laughing I almost dropped my little nephew because I was laughing so hard, but my little brother kept on going really fast so I was tired of him not slowing down I just told him to stop the motorcycle and I graved my nephew and just left home walking but I was still laughing. Then when I got home my mom asked me why was I laughing I told her the story she was laughing to. "
7," To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter @MONTH1 some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as @CAPS1 someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when @CAPS2 hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle @CAPS2 not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. @CAPS2 shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy @CAPS4 of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or @CAPS1 he Is okay @CAPS2 seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far @CAPS2 has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood @CAPS2 makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. @CAPS1 I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that @CAPS2 brings people closer, so use @CAPS2 don't be afraid."
7," Laughter is an integral element to many situations. These situations vary greatly, disasters to the desire to be cheered up to simply wanting to be amused. Humor can make light of circumstances no matter how grave, terrifying or uneasing. The recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in @LOCATION2 made me very worried for my friend @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION1 which I at the time I, and many of my other friends thought was close to some of the more affected areas. Of course, we were all scared for him, but we tried to the best of our ability to make light of this disaster. Our fears were made even worse when he never logged onto the ning or facebook, but we know now that was just because electricity was down for him that night (night for us). When we learned he was safe, at least for the time being we were all incredibly relieved. Humor really helped diffuse the situation, as it has many times before. As of now this is still a story in the making because as this is being written there are still great dangers for that region, not the least of which is the threat of nuclear meltdown. The jokes are continuing into the week. I believe humor can be very helpful during worrying times because making light of a serious situation in a way, makes it feel less serious.  Of course many people look down upon doing this, which is completely understandable. They either don't see that we are legitimately fearful or don't understand and believe we're just joking about it to be ""edgy"" or ""offensive"". People who feel the need to joke about dangerous situations aren't intent upon being malicious or uncaring, they, most often, are people with with a sense of humor and a sense of distress."
7," When I was young, my parents tried to raise our family as @CAPS1. My dad came up with many ways to keep us in a christian environment. He came up with this thing we called ""family worship,"" it was the time where our whole house hold would get together and sing songs and dance. It was a lot of fun. One day my dad came home with this book, filled with little fun songs that had dances to go along with them. @CAPS5, this one particular song I remember was called ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" We would start out singing and moving one arm back and fourth, then two arms, then both our legs. Before we knew it we were jumping up and down and spinning and circles like maniacs! It was really fun though! My dad also came up with story time. All my brothers and sisters would gather around in our living room and my dad would read us a bible story. At the end he would ask us questions and whoever got the most questions right, we would rewarded with a ""@CAPS4"" candy bar. Mmm mmmm those were always my favorite. :) @CAPS5, between the singing and dancing, and all the candy bars, i loved family worship. It was part of the best days of my life and i dont think i'll ever have that much fun with my family again. I'll never forget those @CAPS7 times I had dancing with my little sister @CAPS6.                                           -@CAPS7 times"
7,"  Everything in life that is worth is not easy to achieve. Sometimes you have to try something you've never done before or do something you don't want to do to get the reward or outcome that you want. @CAPS4 was a hot @DATE1 day in the middle of @DATE2. My friend @PERSON1 called me and said that him and his brother are going to a swimming spot called blue horn. @CAPS5 said there is cliffs we can jump off and rapids that we can swim down. This sounded very intriguing. I told him I was up for @CAPS4. @CAPS5 picked me up from my house and we made our way to blue horn.  When we first got there i was surprised because we had to go on a two mile hike that @CAPS5 didn't tell me about. I didn't bring any walking shoes all i had with me were some sandals. This was already looking like a terrible day. We started walking down this long trail that had four or five spots where there was a so much deep, @CAPS1 mud that we had to make a separate path through the bushes so we could get around. Then we get to this really steep hill. When i say steep i mean you can't walk down this hill without having to break into a full sprint or try to stop and most likely start tumbling down the hill. @CAPS4 was all dirt and a couple trees on this hill nothing to hold on to. So what we did was slide down to the first tree and then to the second tree which was about halfway down the hill then we just bolted down the rest of the hill. When i got down the hill all i was thinking was how are we supposed to get back up that? A few minutes later we finally reached our destination. I was hot and sweat and ready to swim. I took of my shirt and set my bag down. I walked over to where @PERSON1 was and looked down at the water. At least @NUM1 feet i was thinking, @CAPS2 what i said was ""@CAPS3 this is nothing""""@CAPS4 gets better"" @PERSON1 replied @CAPS5 pointed up to this tree that had a very rigid board nailed onto some branches that appeared to be a support structure for someone to stand on. I was not planning on jumping off of this wooden plank, @CAPS2 then when @PERSON1 did @CAPS4 i was hoping maybe @CAPS4's not so terrifying when your actually up there. I was blatantly wrong every time i looked down at the water @CAPS4 seems as if i were to jump and never hit the ground. I couldn't be a coward and get down so i figured the only way to get down was to by just leaping off bravely. I counted to three and right as i got to three i stepped forward to leap off and i could feel the warm breeze on my face and the adrenaline pumping through my veins. Before i knew @CAPS4 i hit the water and all those heroic and amazing feelings quickly turned to pain and regret. I had managed to land partially on my back. We got out of the water and @PERSON1 saw my back and said ""@CAPS7 your back is so red!"" I was in a lot of pain @CAPS2 through all this pain @CAPS4 was still so much fun while @CAPS4 lasted and we had a good laugh about @CAPS4 all.  Next up was the rapids. We decided to go down these feet first. The water moves very fast so @CAPS4 carries you like you are a tiny leaf. There was rocks that stuck out of the water that we tried to avoid and there were some rocks hidden below the water that we wish we would have avoided. @CAPS4 was so fun @CAPS2 there was also a lot of pain involved. The entire time we were looking over at each other just abrupt in laughter. Once we got down all the rapids there was a miniature waterfall we swam over to this waterfall and climbed to the top took a seat right on top and just started talking about the day. When we first arrived i thought this was a bad idea coming and i wished i would have made an excuse and not came. After all the hiking and all the troubles getting there when we finally arrived at the cliffs i was scared to jump off, @CAPS2 one reason why me and @PERSON1 are such good friends is because we aren't afraid to take risks to have a good time. Sometimes this lands us in a lot of trouble though! In this case we took the risk to throw our bodies off and could seriously injure ourselves just for the laugh and the thrilling experience. Laughter and excitement don't come from sitting on the couch watching @CAPS9 @CAPS4 comes from going out and trying new things and having a good time. To me that is always worth the risk."
7," Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the @DATE1 I was moving back to @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that @DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we @MONTH1 have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  @DATE1 was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in @LOCATION2, and she was able to come out to @PERSON1 and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go @CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for @CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS1 some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This @DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to."
7," I moved to the @LOCATION4from @LOCATION5 with my family when I was just a child. We moved the small town of @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, where we have lived for @NUM1 years. Over the years there have been many difficult times, but we always managed to get through them by laughing together as a family.This past year has been especially trying, and I don't think we would have survived if we hadn't been able to celebrate the tragic time with laughter. My @CAPS2 stayed in @LOCATION5 when we moved to the @LOCATION1 because he was sick and didn't think he could survive the trip. Last year we finally convinced him to @CAPS3 up here with the rest of the family. He moved in with my family and shared my bedroom. It was hard because he snored and made strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I would wake up tired from lack of sleep, I would just think about the funny noises and laugh.  Then, six months ago, my @CAPS2 was dianosed with a tumor in his brain. There was nothing the doctors could do for him, and they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @CAPS2 what he wanted to do. He said, ""I want all of you to stop looking like I'm already dead and let's go have some fun!"" That was just like @CAPS2. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION2 so he could go to @LOCATION3 before he left this world. I couldn't help laughing at how crazy he could be. Sure enough, when I arrived home from school the next @DATE1, @CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to grab what we needed and get in the van. He had gone out and rented a @NUM2 passenger van for the trip so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He started laughing and told said, ""@CAPS3 it or you're staying behind!"" I started laughing too, and hurried inside to pack. It was the best trip of my life. @CAPS2 told us all kinds of crazy stories about when he was a boy. Mom wrote some of them down so we could always remember them.  When we got to @LOCATION3 we went on every ride in the park. @CAPS2's favorite was @ORGANIZATION1. He wasn't supposed to ride it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, ""I""m sure it won't kill me."" @CAPS4 though it made me sad when he said it, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we went home, @CAPS2 died. @CAPS4 though it has been hard and I have cried about it often, I can't help but laugh when I think about that trip and how much fun we had. @CAPS2 taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around."
7," laughter is an important part of any kind of relationship like your family, friends, or your other half. Now let me tell you why it is important, there was two weeks left of school and my family had planned out to go camping for a week. Finally school was over and as we were all saying our good byes and see you next year to all our friends. My parents came to pick us up in what my dad called an ""@CAPS1"" that looked like an ordinary school bus. We were now off on our way to go to our camping site.  Now you would think that going camping would be for bringing the family together and having fun. But no my brothers were locked into their video games, my mom and sister were both on their phones while my dad was driving. I even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a ""because"". Finally i just decided to let it go and read until we got to our camp site. Finally we arrived and the first thing we did was unload the @CAPS1 and set everything up so we could get comfortable. The same night we were all by the toasty camp fire, and as usual my family was being entertained by there video games, cellphones or everything that they thought was needed out here in the wilderness. As i sat by the fire i gazed at the stars above my head and started to wonder if my family was always going to be like this and never be a close, fun or even exciting family.  The next morning after we were all awake my parents were making breakfast, and my mom had asked me if i remembered to close the @CAPS1 door before going to sleep in my tent, and i said no i forgot knowing how my mom was she got a little mad and asked my sister to go close it. As she walked up to the door she heard noises and went inside to see what it was. Before i could even blink i saw her sprinting out of the @CAPS1 and screaming off the top of her lungs. Right behind her were a group or raccoons chasing her! My dad trying to be a hero runs towards them trying to scare them off, but fails and gets bit on his butt.  Luckily my dad was @CAPS5 but while we were all distracted the raccoons had left with our food. My dad was so mad that he kicked the only log that kept the @CAPS1 from rolling away. And it starts moving right away, we all watch it go down the hill until it rode into a lake. Slowly it started to disappear once it was completely out of sight we all went to the lake staring at the large lake that devoured out @CAPS1 wondering what we were going to do with no vehicle. As we were heading back to the camp site all you could hear for miles was my family arguing. not paying attention of whats in front of them my mom fell in to a mud pit and my dad tried to get her out but slipped in too. Once they got out they looked so outraged and looked as if they were ready to call out mother nature to a fight.  Once we made it back to the camp site we sat down and i took a good look at each one of us. Our clothes were all wet and covered with mud, we were all hungry and not really in the best mood. I sat there and said dad don't get even more mad but but i thought it was pretty funny when the raccoon bit your butt, and i showed him the picture i took when it happened. My family then all looked at it and started laughing and laughing we all suddenly started talking and actually acting like a family! We decided to just walk home and hitch hike, we walked down the road for a good hour until we got a ride from a local trucker we saw down the road. Once we got home we talked more, we spent more time together we were really like the perfect family i wished i could have. That camping trip changed us all and I'm happy that it did because now me and my family are closer than ever! And that's how I can prove that laughter is an important part of any relationship."
7,"                                        Laughter: The @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 Laughter, they say, is the best medicine. We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, ""yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine! "
7," I don't think the importance of laughter will ever be completely understood, even though it's an unconcious action. Laughter is a right of passage, being able to laugh and have a good time brings people together. Laughter bring you and others around you together. Topics to laugh about are limitless. If you really focused on the things you laugh about its kind of dumbfounding. Example:what you see, how things/people look or act, what people say, the possibilites are endless.   When I'm with my friends i always seem to laugh more. One friend in particular, her name is @CAPS1. She has a couple of acres of land, one time we decided to take her quad out for a spin. Keep in mind that this was my first time on a quad. I got a chance to drive, and i jumped at the opportunity! @CAPS1 and i were laughing and smiling the whole time. what an adventure it was. We happened to stumble upon a small hill. We swiched drivers and @CAPS1 floored it over the hill.   The next thing i knew, i was lying on the ground. I was so dizzy I started to laugh! I had never blacked out before and it was a feeling i had never experianced before. I felt like i was in my own world. Suddenly @CAPS1 was screaming my name! I staggered twords her and realized she was in trouble! Her leg had somehow gotten caught in the quad when we went over the hill! Her whole entire head was stuck underneath the quad!! thankfully we were both wearing helmets, but hers squished her face up and i couldent help but laugh! What was i to do?! Being the hero that i am, i raced to her and lifted the quad up off her head before she was a goner! There wasn't much damage, only a few bruises. I soon realized that my phone had gone missing, we spent the next @NUM1 hours searching through the field for it. what a day. There are a few details that i enjoy: @CAPS1 has an unreal house that could probably fit a small country and none of her @NUM2 family members whitnessed anthing that just happened. Also, when we tried pushing the quad up the almost non-exhistant hill, we couldent, although i lifted the whole thing off of her head uphill..ironic.  What im trying to get at here is that in every bad situation, you can always find a little bit of humor somewhere. You just have to look hard enough. It dosent matter how bad it is, for example, you break your arm. It's kind of funny if you think about how you broke it! Some situations are special, like in the case of a family member dying. There really is no funny way to look at that. You can think of the funny times you had with that person or their own sense of humor. You can't live life without laughter."
7,"                                                The Laughter In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are so many elements in a person's life that are important. Many are to make friends, be successful, but mostly to find happiness. Everyone wants happiness in their life right? The biggest form of happiness comes from your heart. Many believe that laughter comes from your heart and is believed to make you and others around you truly happy. One element to laughter being important in a relationship would be optimism to your partner and friends. This shows people that you aren't just a pessimistic, rude, unhappy person all the time. You can actually enjoy life and have a good time.After all no one wants to hang out with someone who is always negative and only looks at the bad things. Your partner will get sick of you and you will lose friends. Being able to laugh and joke around with people makes life a whole lot easier.It @MONTH1 not seem like much but it takes some stress off your shoulders if you have a good time and kick some giggle's. Another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh. What if you get a boyfriend our girlfriend and they had never heard your laugh before and once they heard your laugh they thought it was the most annoying thing in the world? Studies show they would be more than likely to leave you. On that note, if you do have a terribly annoying laugh and that is the reason you dont want to laugh, I would stick with smiling because us girls have pretty cute smiles that let us get away with alot. Lastly, @CAPS2 is one more main part of laughter being important in a relationship and that is happiness. You need to laugh to to be happy. Without laughter what is a smile? Without laughter how will happiness shine through? Lif e can get pretty boring when all you do is act like a mime. No smiling, no laughing, not fun! When you laugh, it helps others to laugh and have a good time. Plus, its fun! Like when you laugh so hard you cry or when you need to go to the bathroom really bad and it makes it worse when you start busting up laughing. Laughing makes memories. And memories are a very important part of growing up. So now that you have learned these three elements as to why or how laughing is important to anyones life, relationship or friendship, go out and laugh. It will make you feel a whole lot better. :)"
7," In the story i am going to tell you, it involves one of my friends and myself. After school one day meself and a buddy of mine went to my house for the night. It was alot of fun, we started off playing video games and laugh really hard when one of us would die in the game. Then after awhile of that it was dinner time and my mom told us to get off and come eat. it was really fun at dinner, we throw stuff at each other when my parents weren't looking. It was a blasted, until dinner was over and we didn't have anything to throw at each other anymore. But now it was time to start playing games again. Now at this time it was about teen o'clock and we were getting really tried so we put in the movie step brother and watched it. It was the best time we had all day we were laughing non stop at everything that was said in the movie and it was great. We both loved it and really wanted to watch it the next morning. But before we could my friends dad was there to pick him up so that was the end of the best time with my friend and the funnyest time ever too. It was great we laught non stop the whole night. Now that just shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
7," I met my best friend @PERSON2 when we were in kindergarten. At the time we were both shy, and we looked to one another for comfort. Little did we know the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of good memories, and plenty of laughter. Last @DATE1, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the @DATE2, so while they were home in @LOCATION4 my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college, so my parents invited @PERSON2 to attend. We were so excited, for this was our first time to @LOCATION3 together. @PERSON2 and I had many activities planned and I couldn't wait to show her around @ORGANIZATION1 (@LOCATION1 @PERSON1). The only downside of the trip was that we would be driving, we would be in the car for about @NUM1 hours. I had known this since we used to go to @ORGANIZATION1 a lot when I was little so I brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION1 that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that @PERSON2 and I had quoted each other for. @PERSON2 and I have an odd kind of humor, we think everything is funny when were together. It can be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why.  Finally, a good @NUM1 hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, it was late though and we had to unpack, therefore I wouldn't be showing @PERSON2 around until the next day. That didn't mean our night wasn't exciting, in the backyard of the house there is a pool house, and in order to keep someone at the home when no one is there my grandparents rent out the pool house. My parents had known that a man named @CAPS1 lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in @ORGANIZATION1. That night my mom asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready, it was dark outside so I made @PERSON2 come with me. When we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 looked exactly how I imagined him, he had on red shorts, no shoes and a peach colored t-shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy, he looked like a big beach bum. @CAPS1 quickly made his way over to me and @PERSON2 and introduced himself. He was pretty nice and very goofy. Throughout our whole conversation @PERSON2 and I couldn't keep straight faces.@CAPS1 said that he had to go so he wanted to teach us a handshake that he made up. He stuck his hand out and curled his index, ring, and middle finger so that they were in towards his palm and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb. He gestured us to do the same thing. We all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the center of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs, he said good evening and ran back to the pool house. It was very odd, but so funny that my dad, @PERSON2 and I still do this on occasion.  The next day, I took @PERSON2 downtown, and showed her around. When we were on our way back we stopped inside a craft store, that I, nor @PERSON2 had ever been in. When we walked in it looked like any other average craft store, but as we explored a little more we noticed there was a huge section of armor and helmets that @CAPS3 soldiers wore. Us being big dorks decided that we had to put them on, so we put on the helmets and armor and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people. The ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us and it had us laughing at ourselves too. We fell down from laughing so hard, at this point the people who were working were not laughing anymore they were mad that we had fallen while wearing the armor. They came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip we had made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion laughter is very important in relationships, it is healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel. This @DATE1 @PERSON2 and I will be returning to @LOCATION1 @PERSON1 and are looking forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share.   "
7," Laughter is a common occurrence in my home. @CAPS8 always brings my family closer together and allows us to escape from all the stress caused by everyday life. Without laughter, we wouldn't have the close relationships that we have today. For example, everyone in my family has their own funny nickname. Half the time when one of us is laughing, @CAPS8's because one of those names has been mentioned. I can't remember when we started making them, but I do remember how each name came to exist.  @CAPS1 is the ""beady-eyed marshmallow."" I made up the name myself, and at first @CAPS1 absolutely hated @CAPS8, complaining that I was being completely disrespectful and rude. You see, whenever she gets mad, her little green eyes get all narrow and beady as they light up with anger. Whenever I'd get into trouble, I'd randomly burst into laughter at the mere thought of @CAPS8. As to the marshmallow part, hugging her has always been like squeezing a fluffy marshmallow. After @CAPS1 finally grew accustomed to her nickname, she fondly referred to me as her ""mini marshmallow."" For the most part my @CAPS1 and I do look alike, so the nickname naturally fits. I don't have her famous beady eyes though.  The rest of my family members have nicknames that originate from one of our young cats, @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 is a huge, squeezable @ORGANIZATION1 cat with a double-jointed tail, and the source of all things that make us laugh. Our lovable fluff ball always has cat rodeos with his brother and sisters, and on the rare occasions when he's actually tired, he will snuggle up with us. Everybody absolutely adores him - he is definitely the center of attention at home. Through his popularity, @ORGANIZATION2 has gained several pet names, two of which are @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS3.  We like to call @CAPS4 a ""tootlebutt"" or ""tb"" for short. @ORGANIZATION2 is his cat, so the nickname suited him. @CAPS4 is the hardest worker of our family - leaving for work before anyone else is awake and getting home around seven every night. When @CAPS4 is at home he likes to spend his time relaxing and playing his favorite game, @CAPS6. Momalways disses him for that and the fact that he constantly asks her to repeat herself. @CAPS8's actually quite the laughing matter at home, listening to them bicker about whether or not @CAPS4 is a ""tb.""  I have two younger brothers, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. The older of the two, @PERSON1, is considered to be ""big @ORGANIZATION1,"" and @PERSON2 is ""little @ORGANIZATION1."" @CAPS8's a spin-off on @ORGANIZATION2's nickname. Loosely translated, @CAPS8 means that both of my brothers are fun and entertaining like @ORGANIZATION2.  Personally, I think that our use of nicknames is a nice way to keep us happy and laughing. When you hear a silly name that you've grown accustomed to, @CAPS8's hard not to laugh, let alone smile. @CAPS8 cheers everyone up and lets us all know that we're here for each other. Laughter keeps us close, and will always keep our family strong. "
7," Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH1 be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...."" That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON1. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching ""@CAPS2 A"". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS3 laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It might make you feel like your dying sometimes, but that feeling is worth it."
7," It's said that laughter is the best medicine. I have found that to be true with my best friend. Whenever she gets upset, I can always cheer her up by making a joke or two. She gets upset a lot so I've almost mastered the skill of making her laugh. For this story, we will call her @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and her mother get in arguments often, but what @NUM1 year old kid doesn't fight with their parents? They make her so upset sometimes that she feels the need to stay at my house for the @TIME1. When she first gets to my house, I have to crack a couple ice breakers so that she'll start to feel better. They're usually just simple jokes about what we were just talking about or maybe an inside joke from when we were younger. After I've gotten her calmed down and relaxed, we start to have fun to get her mind off of things. That usually includes watching movies, playing my @CAPS1, or maybe just sitting around talking. If we feel up to it, we might even do the typical teenage girl thing, facials. Though we don't usually @TIME1 up doing that, it's a possibility.  Towards the @TIME1, we discuss the fight so she can get some things off her chest. @PERSON1 spills a few tears, realizes that it's common for teenagers and parents to fight, and then we go to sleep and everything's fine and dandy in the @TIME2. My mom even makes us breakfast. Helping her always turns out for the best. We @TIME1 up having a great time and with even more inside jokes. I plan on being there for her in her times of need for as long as she'll need me. Knowing her, that will be for awhile and I'm okay with that."
