0,"`` We left them there to study ! '' Proclaimed the executor . Clearly outraged by the suggestion . Slamming a fist on the desk . <newline> <newline> `` I understand you reluctance to interfere ... '' Breached the minister with obvious disregard . `` But it 's not the only control group , your research ... '' <newline> <newline> The minister was cut off . `` It 's not simply a mater of the integrity of the project . '' The executor composed him self . `` What you 're suggesting is abhorrent , illegal by our own laws , and short sighted . We can not give technology to creatures such as these . They are too resilient . Too unpredictable . '' <newline> <newline> Annoyed by arguments the minister re-asserts him self . `` This discussion is not a matter on weather or not we proceed . That decision is long out of our hands . We are here to determine the best method for weaponizing your project . '' <newline> <newline> The executor of the project was right to be overly cautious . The subject of his research has shown remarkable resilience . Control and experimental groups thrive in the most hostile of environments . The control group the minster intended to use should have died out ages ago . Yes , it would be a great loss of scientific value to intervene with this particular group . But it seems that times are desperate . <newline> <newline> The executor seemed lost in thought for the moment . Apparently the minister had finished speaking and he was unaware . <newline> <newline> `` Weaponize ... '' he mumble . <newline> <newline> `` You can not weaponize a force of nature minister . Giving control group 1 any technology would be disastrous beyond measure . A force of nature is manageable because it can not think , it has no malice . All that these creatures lack is the means to execute the desires of the most vial and malicious consciousnesses we have ever encountered . '' <newline> <newline> `` Your concern has been well noted , we need to ... '' Groaned the minister , clearly becoming bored of the discussion . <newline> <newline> The executor did not let him finish . `` I doubt it has , or has at least has fallen on deaf ears . These creatures , though they are sentient , do not think as a group , unless they are afraid . Fear raises a terrible force in these beings that has no equal in any other life we 've encountered . I can not be party to any plan to unleash this upon any foe , no matter how grave our need . '' <newline> <newline> The minister gestured , as the executor was removed he added the thought `` That is why we are loosing . ''

0,"“ I suggest we initiate protocol Zestraol ” <newline> <newline> The cramped bridge fell dead silent , and the large , bulbous , heads of the Trepentari turned in unison , towards the head of their table . Protocol Zestraol , named after a large jawed insect , native to the home planet of the Trepentari Republic , had been on the books for centuries , and hadn ’ t even been mentioned in a formal counsel meeting since its inception . Named for the Zestraol insect , which locked it ’ s oversized mandibles onto it ’ s prey , any time the Zestraol insect bit , it was as likely to decapitate itself as kill it ’ s prey . <newline> <newline> After a few moments , which dragged like hours , hushed murmurs spread like wildfire throughout the command center of the last Trepentari capital ship , more of a mobile bunker now , than a military vehicle . Held within were the genetic records of all creatures native to Trepentar , as well as highly encrypted co-ordinates to a planet similar to it on the edges of the Galactic rim . Each individual felt the weight of their desperate cargo , and each held it in a different way . <newline> <newline> Amongst the murmurs , the thin , spindly arm of the Ambassador to the Federation snaked it ’ s way through the silence , until it was held like a white flag above the heads the consulate , what was left of the Trepantari leadership . The Ambassador ’ s normally calm , confident , and soft spoken voice , carefully cultivated to reflect Trepantari cultural values , nearly broke under his own shock , fear and disgust . <newline> <newline> “ But , Sir , the Federation of Sapient species have classified any technological sharing with , with , the humans , ” the word fell out of his mouth like dead weight , “ as a interplanetary crime , we could face.. ” <newline> <newline> “ Extinction ? ” , hissed the Admiral , acting head of the Trepantari emergency government , from her position at the head of the table . “ We already stare extinction in the eye , The Veythat Conglomerate have deployed nuclear weapons on two of our planets . Another violation of intergalactic law ” . <newline> <newline> She waited for the point to sink in , the only other species known to have deployed Nuclear weapons within relevant intergalactic history had been the humans , the Admiral had chosen this atrocity well , a parallel hung in the air . <newline> <newline> “ We have nothing to fear from the Humans that has not already been offered to us as threat by the Veythat . The only consequence we face , is that a galaxy that has turned a blind eye to our suffering , may also feel the terror , the primordial fear of not just our own death , but the possible death of our species , in the same way that we now know . We stand to gain a possible ally , a rabid Kluaxar perhaps , but our own rabid Kluaxar. ” <newline> <newline> As her words filled the room , a voice tainted with anger , Trepantari dignitaries shifted in their seats . Her passion drew them in , and as she broke with the custom for quite considered political speech , the Admiral coaxed an anger and a passion to the forefront of her fellow counsellors . <newline> <newline> “ The Humans are a cruel , ignoble , and disgusting species . They make war on each other without any thought for peace , and they hoard what resources they have , building great empires on the backs of slaves of their own species . They rape , kill , and torture each other over wealth which they could easily share . At the height of their most progressive empires , stand great oligarchs , who buy and sell humans with no regard . We will unleash a great plague on the galaxy if we do this thing , and even the Veythat will know fear . An adult human is capable , barehanded , of killing at least three Veythat in combat , and they are known to bear litters of up to four children . Their adulthood cycle is one third of ours , and one half of the Veythat . They are known to arm their children as soldiers , and are willing to fight beside them as comrades . They are intelligent and adaptive , within years of the first experimental Sapient Counsel technology drop , they had reached their orbiting moon . They are capable , and they are violent , and the only thing they hate more than themselves , is something which does not resemble them . Even amongst their own species , they are known to kill each other over skin pigmentation . We are fortunate in being bipedal , they will focus on our enemies first. ” <newline> <newline> Heads began to nod , in grim anticipation of the decision that would be made here . The Admiral continued , cultivating the anger and irrationality that can be found when any sapient creature faces oblivion . <newline> <newline> “ If we supply them with technology , we can hold back , we can manipulate their encryption , we can build them an empire with our knowledge at its heart . We can build a symbiosis . They will hate us , but they will hate the others more , they will need us , and like a Klauxar , it is possible we can train them . I will broke no arguments , as emergency head of the emergency council , I exercise my right to call for an silent vote. ” <newline> <newline> As hands raised across the crowded bridge in favor , the Admiral ’ s heart sank at what she knew her duty to be . <newline> <newline> “ It is settled , I volunteer my daughter as ambassador to the humans , the mission will launch in two cycles . I have already made the preparations. ” <newline>

0,"Our War Council was surprised when these Humans asked what we knew about the Aldins ' own core worlds . <newline> <newline> `` What are their defenses , their detection systems for tracking ships jumping in from deep space ? '' <newline> <newline> We told them that what we knew from our own attempts to fight in Aldin systems was that they were passive at home , that they feared no grand attacks from any societies in their region and that all our atempts to strike out at them were initially successful until our forces were either driven back or destroyed by their ships dispatched *after* we had engaged . <newline> <newline> `` They are preeminent in our space , and unafraid , their navy seems content to swat us away like the stinging bugs of your world . They have no orbital perimeters like you ask . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , my Lords , but *how* long does it take for them to come ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Perhaps as long as several of your earth days . '' <newline> <newline> The Humans seemed shocked by this . <newline> <newline> `` How did you not destroy a planet then leave before being interdicted ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We were a peaceful race with no grand laser sweepers or ray blankets to attack a planet we can barely engage ships in the void , do you expect us to shoot every Aldine in time and leave ? '' <newline> <newline> `` These Aldines , they are city dwellers like us and like your people ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , they live in big urban cores , besides the farmers . '' <newline> <newline> The humans went on their own and were gone for some days . Aldine attacks destroyed the Faris System Navy and two of our settled worlds in that time , but in a place the Men called Dog Sector , our forces supplemented by a detachment of human advisers repelled repeated landing attempts . When the humans returned we were ready to give them anything . <newline> <newline> `` Now Councilors you can see that our detachments of military advisers have had good results in ground war against these things . But we want to win the war for you so we want at least four of your corvette style ships with crew put at our disposal for a test , an operation over a planet we designated A-1 , a big urban world from your intelligence . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whatever you need from us you can have . '' <newline> <newline> `` Very good . '' <newline> <newline> In good time the humans outfitted these ships in manners that seemed odd to us and drove their captains mad , I was sent along with them to observe for the Council . The humans seemed excited the whole time , touring the ships , testing the structures and the computers and always loading great munitions and other things brought special from their system as quick as we could jump them and they even told me their plan but I found it ridiculous , impossible . When we jumped for A-1 I noticed the other three ships did not jump with us . <newline> <newline> `` Slight adjustment for those boats Councilor . '' <newline> <newline> We made normal time to A-1 and there were no Aldine military ships to meet us . We quickly went into orbit and the men made one last check of their payload and me and the Human Admiral watched the green planet below from the bridge observation window and he marveled at the big steel blotches of city in the landmasses . <newline> <newline> `` We are ready sir . '' <newline> <newline> `` Shoot the damn things then . '' <newline> <newline> The admiral shook his head as the ship shuddered and a thousand trails of objects went down toward the planet , some arcing to go around to the far side . <newline> <newline> `` Dumb son 's of bitches , goddamn , it 's like they never figured on someone doing this . '' <newline> <newline> I wondered why he was so bothered but then I saw it , hundreds of huge blasts on the surface , big red bursts , then black churnings of smoke and dirt , huge thunderheads of dead matter being sucked up and dispersed over the once day lit ground . Ground transmissions we were monitoring cut off . <newline> <newline> `` Well whoever we did n't get will be dead in a week of fallout anyways . '' <newline> <newline> `` Admiral , it seems you only needed one of these ships for the mission , why did you order four ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well we figured we would try and cut the head off these things if what you telling us was true . We 'll send word to the other three to proceed , and then we will head off to the rest of the planets in this system and do the same . Then we will jump , a day before these boys show up . Then we do it again . If it works all right we can cripple their empire or whatever in a couple weeks . Their fleets wo n't have a home to return to , and when they try and retaliate we 'll blast them out of the sky with these missiles since none of you aliens have them or really know how they work . You wo n't ever have them . After we finish this up we 'll talk about the piece up here we get for winning this for you . These corvettes will be a nice start , my boys say already they have our computers ready to fly them if need be. `` <newline> <newline> It was at this moment I thought about how along with these weapons the humans had brought on board a good number of their military advisers and how they more and more seemed to be stationed at bulkhead doors and armed and their smiles seemed mocking . <newline> <newline> <newline>

0,"`` Drax , the Slovians have taken E13-49e , 4th planet . '' <newline> <newline> Drax looked up from it 's notebooks . `` How 'd they do it ? Our anti-polirization shield should have stopped their super weapon ! '' <newline> <newline> Gordon scratches its chin . They 've been at war with teh Slovians a long time . Slovains were an alien race that was bent on conquering . They liked the idea of using the Yolo race , their own , for technological advancements . The Yolo had thrived for 400,000 generations , more or less , Developing FTL travel , dyson spheres , short-range high-power phase knives ( a tool infinitely better than previous scalpals in surgery . They 've created pro-vita food sources that are roughly 90 % more energy efficient than the most calorie and nutrient efficient plants , and it can be grown easily on space flights even far from any star . <newline> <newline> But the Slovians , it seems , had mastered conquering instead . They tended to target world governments . and have used their super-weapon to force each world to submit . <newline> <newline> Which is why the Yolo started seaking help . Out of the more than 1000 planets inhabited by the Yolo , they 've already lost 30 . At a logorithmic rate , the whole government would be conquered very quickly , far faster than they could expand to compensate . <newline> <newline> So what species could they get help from ? Gordon and Drax had an idea . A primitive race by most accounts - no FTL travel , physics WAY behind most advanced species . Their governments are actually fractured , even though they have worldwide communication . We saught out the humans . And here is where history got interesting . We negotiated with the humans for roughly 1/10th of their yearly cycle . A month , they call it . We gave them access to a great deal of our technology , under contract that would not attack us . Primarily , we gave them access to our doctors , some of our junior scientists , and our FTL engines and ship designs . <newline> <newline> So lets go back to the beginning . The Yolo just lost another planet to the Slovians . This is not good . But with context ... . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Drax '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes Gordan ? '' <newline> <newline> `` How is the reclaiming of E-1938r solar system going ? I heard they were going to enter the 11th planet yesterday . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , yeah , I read the report this morning . The Slovians pulled out of the outer 3 planets within hours , they 're retreating inwards . It looks very good , but the humans are concerned with the slovian supply line first . They said something about warp-fusion bombs on their dilithium supply ships . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh ... wow . Did the Slovians not defend against dilithium capture ? Seems they would just need a teleporter . '' <newline> <newline> `` You do n't understand Gordon , they did n't capture the ships . They did n't just maneuver and force the dilithium ships to ground . They destroyed them . '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait ... Drax ... you 're telling me they ... '' <newline> <newline> `` yes , destroyed the ships . '' <newline> <newline> `` But how did they not escape ? A bomb ca n't explode faster than the speed of light . And warp technology ca n't expand fast enough either . Our best scientists and tactical engineers struggled with that one for several clicks now , and even our quantum computers could n't figure out a path . '' <newline> <newline> `` Gordon , think about the way humans fight . They did n't give the ships warning at all . '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait ... what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` They did a sneak attack . They crippled the supply line , and then they did one better . '' <newline> <newline> `` Drax , what are you talking about ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Gordon , they created a dummy ship that puts off the same signature . They 're sending a false ship to planets 7 and 6 . They 're skipping planet 8 altogether saying it 'll be conquered too quickly to matter . '' <newline> <newline> `` A dummy ship ? For what purpose ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Destruction of slovians . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , reclaiming the world ... but they ca n't support war-ship weapons . So how are they going to threaten the capitals ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , you still do n't understand . I did n't say they 're going to threaten the Slovians . I said their plan is to destroy them . Fusion warp bombs for the space crafts , with anti-polorized shrapnel to destroy life support systems . They 're hidden in the engine , and will explode there . And before that , Dilithium iron poisoning for the shipment . If they try to use that dilithium for anything , their reactors will be ruined forever . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh ... '' <newline> <newline> Gordon had to think about hte implications of this . On one hand , they were reclaiming planets so fast the Slovians had no hope in continuing the war . But on the other hand ... what worlds will the Yolo have ? Lead-poisoned Dilithium , shrapnal and fusion-warp scars orbiting planets , tactics that had no direct advantage to the Yolo , only destruction to the Slovians . The effectiveness was scary . The long term implications were too large to comprehend . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Drax ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes Gordon ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Do you ever think ... maybe we should n't have uplifted the Humans ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know Gordon , I do n't know . ''

0,"`` They 've taken Marin , sir . '' <newline> <newline> The Quelic minister sighed , his head in his claw . The Brasa had been , in brazen defiance of the galactic high counsel 's suggestion , chipping away at the Gartian World Alliance for years now . Raids there , a world taken here , maybe a high profile assassination . But this standard galactic year had marked a complete shift into total war , the Brasa have taken every single outer world in less than 10 Gartian months . <newline> <newline> `` Thank you , Charin . You can go home now . `` , said the minister . The young aid looked awkwardly at his feet , shifting his weight onto his non artificial leg . <newline> <newline> `` If it 's okay with you sir , I have work to do '' <newline> <newline> The minister looked up . *What a brave boy* , he thought *How tragic* <newline> <newline> `` Fine , go to your work then '' the minister said , his face softening `` Please send a message to the security adviser and all available ranking generals . Tell them we 'll be having an emergency war meeting in the grand chambers '' <newline> The meeting was not going well , not a single feasible idea had been produced . The security adviser Callek Brah , high prince of the 16 and a half bogs on the stilted hills ( *God spare me from having to recite a royals name ever again* , thought the minister ) , had immediately suggested a complete retreat . It was downhill from there . Not a single legitimate defense plan had been even theorized . The minister watched two generals argue over what sort of weapon would best be deployed to destroy Gartia , presumably to deprive the Brasa of any resources , and sighed . *So this is how the Quelic will die* he thought , *squabbling amongst themselves on how to best commit suicide* <newline> <newline> `` We could ask the humans for aid '' <newline> <newline> All went quiet as they faced the one who spoke . The young general Kaldenko stood up , her face bright . `` We get them into the war . Not only could they be our salvation , but imagine the alliance if they were successful . We would push the Brasarian bastards back to their little belt , and we 'll have the humans on our side . '' <newline> <newline> `` How '' , the minster spoke up , `` will they be getting here . They have no fast ships , they 're still working with impulse drives . It 's an offense to give a class 2 species the secret of the FTL drive . The high council reprimands would be- '' <newline> <newline> `` To speak freely sir , I do n't give a single shit what those old farts say '' Kaldenko said , clicking her claws together nervously . A hushed murmur went up , speaking that way to the minister was unthinkable . `` This is n't arguing about trade rights or taxes , this is war ! The death or enslavement of every Quelian on the planet ! If the high council wo n't help us , then we defy every last ordinance out there ! '' Her face grew red and her teeth bared `` We might have spent our lives as traders but at least we should try to die fighting back however we can ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Madness ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Unthinkable '' <newline> <newline> `` Completely unacceptable '' <newline> <newline> `` The humans are- '' <newline> <newline> `` THE HUMANS '' , the minister said , his deep booming voice silencing the squabblers `` are the single most bloodthirsty race out there . A people of psychopaths and murders . Few ships would even dream of entering the system they have , their little planets home of the greatest and most terrifying soldiers imaginable . Every single human that 's managed to get onto the crew of any ship has proven their ruthlessness a thousand times over , not even the pirate crews will seek them out . They 've waged more wars in the 200 years they 've been monitored than we 've had war 's in our known history . To uplift them could be the end of the relative peace in the galaxy . Do you , Kaldenko , really believe we should throw away the lives of a countless billion worlds that could fall to them ? '' The minster stood mere inches from her , his eye meeting hers . She gulped and clinked her claws together <newline> <newline> `` I 'd give every single life to save our people . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's decided then '' The minister declared , grim and humorless . The crowd stood in stunned silence . `` Since no other idea for a defense has been suggested , we go with this . I call this meeting to an end . Charin ! Call up the flight core , have them prepare their fastest ships . We need to have enough room for 10,000 beings . Send a message to the science league that I expect the greatest minds of FTL theory here in a days time . If any of these offers are refused , please note I am also officially beginning the drafting of any and all available people and resources . Generals , I expect you to have an army prepared when I return . Except for you , Kaldenko , you 're coming with me . You 'll be on board as well , Charin , so I suggest you take the time to say goodbye to your family now . We leave for earth . ''

0,"I write this letter to give an overview with commentary of the events that led to your arrival on this Universal Stage . As Chief Researcher of the Sol System before the war , I documented and recorded your history and psychology , and I shall continue this now that victory has been achieved . <newline> <newline> You called yourselves Homo Sapiens Sapien , or Wise Wise Man . I had always found that funny , the sheer arrogance , but I see now how you deserved that title . However , to the rest of the United Universal Confederation , you were called a Class Twelve Threat : A species that could not be permitted outside of their Home System , due to potential Universal danger . <newline> <newline> It was an honor your species shared with a small number of others ; creatures that could spawn black holes unconsciously or others that converted all matter into energy . Although , to be completely honest , the other races that belonged on that list were born with some uncontrollable element that made them dangerous , you simply chose to make yourself dangerous . <newline> <newline> Was it some cruel ironic fate , then , that I , who had personally petitioned the UUC Council for your placement on the list , would end up giving you the very tools to allow you to expand outside your system ? But what alternative did I have ? My people , the Voxhus , were alone . The UUC had betrayed us , turned their back on all that we had done . They made deals with the Sydonians . We were faced with our own inevitable destruction , a single planet left . <newline> <newline> You see , Wise Wise Man , long before we came down like your mythical Prometheus , to bestow the gift of fire upon you , we had once considered ourselves also the Wisest . This of course was our folly . As one of the six Great Races of the Federated Systems , the leaders of what you call the “ Milky Way , ” we were the Scientific leaders of this Galaxy . Along with the Legendary Builders of Hadria , The Industrialists of Argolops , The Great Bankers of Isama , The Master Artisans of Ellepsis , and of course the Ruthless Warriors of Sydonia . At the Federated Systems height we ruled twenty quadrillion citizens , a hundred thousand system . <newline> <newline> You humans who have experienced nothing but a steady stream of Empires betraying and toppling over another since you began breathing would have never been surprised by the Sydonians . However , we were completely broken . While you had just discovered the existence of the America ’ s , a galactic war had just started . We supported our allies as best we could , but we were Scientists , and our species characteristics made us weak soldiers . <newline> <newline> I would like to flatter ourselves and say that we intended to die with our Home-World and that our contact with you was in fact a desperate last attempt to win , but as I said at the start I intend to provide a clear and concise document of the events leading up to the rise of the Human Empire . It was as the first Sydonian scout ships jumped in to our outer edges that we Voxhian Elite decided to flee to the only place they wouldn ’ t imagine to look . Can you imagine our surprise on discovering that just one thousand years after you started conquering your last remaining continent that you had already finished colonizing the last planet in your solar system a century ago . And yet even then , you were still at war with yourself . You were fighting over the last resources of your system , when we arrived . We were horrified to learn that in your quest for expansion that you had already long begun draining your Sun and destroyed several of your own planets . You were trapped in your own Solar System , strangling yourself . If not for us , you would have likely ended up just like your own Sun , extinguished . <newline> <newline> Of course , we had a mutual interest in each other . We were both two species abandoned by the Universe , and as we were drowning we found each other and grasped tightly . And knowing that the Universe had turned against us , we turned against it . No Voxhian felt sympathy when the Sydonian World ’ s began to burn . Nor did we fear when the Universe began to take notice . <newline> <newline> Perhaps you rubbed off on us just a little , as we were proud that we were fighting beside the most frightening and horrific force we had ever seen . The Universe shuddered at your final victory . It had taken several centuries , and we had lost our home-world and most of our population and you had lost so many citizens of your own , but the Sydonian people no longer existed within this Galaxy or any other . <newline> <newline> Wise Wise Man now you rule by yourself and the Universe steels itself against your expansion . You have already surpassed our tiny Federated Systems . I await eagerly to see what comes next . <newline> <newline> This officially concludes the overview of the events that led to your arrival at this point . Faithfully yours , <newline> <newline> Viyod the Last of the Voxhian . <newline> <newline> ( I guess for my first post on reddit , it might as well be a big one . )

0,"Hopefully not too late . <newline> <newline> They stood in awe . They figured we existed , but to actually see us , and communicate with us , and in their language ! Generals of war , leaders of countries , men of science , all stood before us , confounded by our offer . <newline> <newline> <newline> We were honest from the start , they knew we were weakened , and it was strange . We thought it risky to let them know , for fear that they would try to take our technology by force . We had studied them so much in the past , and their violence stood out the most . However they were an unpredictable species , and their eagerness to help , however selfish , only helped to prove that maybe we were wrong about them . <newline> <newline> <newline> Their scientist were completely against the idea They wanted so badly to explore the universe , but the idea of militarization was not in their interest , I could tell they wanted peace and advancement for their species . The first thing a general asked was if it was possible to attach an ftl to a nuclear weapon of theirs . I admit I was amazed by the idea . However I could see the disappointment in the face of their scientists . I could tell they did n't like the general 's thinking . I could n't feel sad for this human , he would get his chance later , my people were running out of time . <newline> <newline> <newline> The general 's plan made great sense , I could tell that these , humans , did n't want to get too involved . However they could not pass this opportunity up . We worked tirelessly to fit the FTL drives to their weapons of mass destruction . Their creativity was astounding . This must be what the scientist feared , working along their military engineers left me afraid of the evil they were willing to put up with in order to win . It 's amazing how they were able to survive this long , as if being from a world with such few resources wasnt enough . Its a good thing that they did n't have the resources of other planets , who knows what they would have brought this galaxy . <newline> <newline> <newline> We had fifty of their weapons ready to go . I had suggested only two , but they said crippling the enemy is n't the way to win . They wanted complete surrender , or total annihilation . I understood why after they explained it . Attacking an enemy such as the Ghull , and leaving them crippled would not stop this war . Their tactics were terrifying . I could n't stop them now . The only thing that gave me peace of mind was that it seemed they only wanted to eliminate the threat . Without the intention of needless violence against other races . We might be able to coexist after this . <newline> <newline> <newline> The Ghull only have 10 planets . However their military had hundreds of thousands of ships , that being a small estimate . The humans were able to find out that the orders came from the planet , and determined that by focusing on the planet 's , we could cut their brains and leave the ships aimless enough to fight them later . It seemed like a plan that would work . It had to , out of all the civilizations , they were the most ruthless . Even more than the Ghull . <newline> <newline> <newline> We took out eight planets effortlessly , the Ghull had no idea what hit them , and it seemed that they had not prepared for anyone to fight back . This pleased the humans . It filled them with vigor . The Ghull put up more of a fight with the last two planets , but it was n't enough . They also fell . The humans had figured that by blowing the nukes from inside the planets was the most effective way to destroy them . I will admit that it was the most frightening thing I have ever seen . I say this even after seeing planets destroyed naturally by the chaos in the universe . Black holes disintegrating solar systems with life . Gamma ray burst hitting planets that had n't yet discovered how to shield themselves . These destructive power paled in comparison to the planet busting nukes these humans had created with our technology . Rather simple actually , they just had to make their nukes last long enough inside the planet so that the wormhole created by our engines could wreak a bit of havoc on the stability of the planet before they went off . Terrifying but amazing . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` With this I conclude my report . '' I said , still trembling before the galactic council . `` These humans , terrifying as they are , do n't seem to be a threat as long as they are n't threatened . Considering they have already had a jump start into intergalactic technology , it may be best to just let them join our community , as I would rather be their ally than their enemy . '' What I hid from the council was that I feared letting them into our community , their society rules , their laws , their customs . All of these were a bit archaic , but being with them I learned not to fear the unknown future . I 'm sure I made the right decision . <newline> <newline>

0,"The visit was cordial . The human stood there , pretending to smile , as he greeted each individual of our nation . He seemed happy to be there . He was , after all , the first human on our soil . We had a long black list of races that we did not allow in our airspace , humans were at the top of our list . They had a long history that was soaked in blood . Their own blood , the blood of other races , so much death . It was a necessary allowance however , since the race second on our list had declared war . <newline> <newline> But here was this ... this man . He moved carefully , he calculated his every move and action . He seemed peaceable and kind . I could tell the smile was a facade , but this geniality ? I could n't tell at all . <newline> <newline> He smiled to me . `` Head of Science , Corral'gith . It is a pleasure to meet you ! I 've been a fan of your work in the medical field for as long as I can remember . You 've saved so many lives ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Master of War , Stevenson . You 've taken so many . '' My tone was cold , I could not help it . My life was dedicated to saving , his was dedicated to absolute annihilation . His smile faded , no , cracked . Beyond that , he did n't seem to react at all . `` What do you plan to say during your appeal to the approaching armies ? That is , if you do n't plan on opening fire before that stage . '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course I do n't . '' He said , the smile returning as if he 'd heard a silly joke among my harsh words . `` We helped establish that rule of war , we do n't intend to break it . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , you would want an amiable slaughter . '' <newline> <newline> He left me without a response . I stood there for a moment in silence before I moved with my colleagues and kin to the viewing platform where opening comments were already underway . <newline> <newline> `` I entreat you to end this war Galathar . '' Said the human , speaking into a microphone that would transmit his voice to the war ship . `` This planet is peaceful , they have no military or military technology . Your father would have never picked a fight so one-sided . '' <newline> <newline> `` MY FATHER ! '' Bellowed the giant . A voice heard twice , once from the speakers that transmitted from the ship and again as it echoed out of the massive steel device of war that hovered several yards away . `` MY FATHER WAS COWARD WHO PICK FEW FIGHTS , WOULD NOT EVEN FIGHT HUMANS ! I WILL FIGHT ALL ! GALATHAR ARMY STRONG ! '' <newline> <newline> There was a burst of red light from the prow of the ship . The beam was aimed for the human 's chest , but something moved it aside where it collided with the building and exploded . The structural integrity remained , but a large chunk had gone missing . I noticed that after . Right then my eyes were studying the human who had not so much as flinched in reaction . <newline> <newline> `` As Master of War I am sorry to inform you that opening fire during this moment of peace has been taken as an act of war , you will be given to the count of three or until another shot is fired to surrender without any damage . '' His voice reminded me of myself not moments ago , cold and uncaring . <newline> <newline> `` One . '' The human began , voice steady as he opened a small digital menu on his wrist device . <newline> <newline> `` GALATHAR NOT CARE HUMAN WAR ! '' Came the roar again . <newline> <newline> `` Two . '' The human continued to count . <newline> <newline> `` FIGHT GALATHAR ! '' The laser fired again , and again was deflected away . <newline> <newline> Silently the human tapped his display . <newline> <newline> A small black orb appeared in the air beside the man , already in motion . It flew at incredible speed towards the metal monstrosity that housed the emperor of the most war-like enemy we had ever known . It penetrated the ship as if it were made from wet cardboard , and then , in a moment I will never forget , the sound of thousands of tons of steel collapsing simultaneously filled the air . The ship imploded and fell to the ground . <newline> <newline> The channel went dead . <newline> <newline> The human called over one of my kin to assist him and together they redirected the microphone 's transmission . Thanking briefly the one who had helped him , the human then turned to the microphone fully . `` Shabnar , I have the bad news that your eldest brother has died due an act of aggression . Do you , as the new leader of your race , accept an offer of peace from us , the human race ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Shabnar ... Shabnar agree . '' <newline> <newline> `` Good . '' And then he left . I should n't have been surprised . He handled war after all , someone else did the peace treaty . <newline> <newline>

0,"The war had been going on for generations . Entire lifecycles lost to this futile waste of resources . We were n't even warlike creatures , we are artists , scientist allways looking for harmony in all things , definitely not warriors . Unlike the Kar'Sai , they are ravenous and warlike creatures . <newline> <newline> <newline> Our spaceships and people could n't compare to the Kar'Sai ships . And so we grew desperate so desperate indeed that we found oureselves looking for help all over the galaxy . Sadly the reputation of our enemy travelled just as fast as our spaceships . <newline> <newline> None of the spacefaring civilizations were willing to help , they were to caught in their own preparations . And when we had almost given up a strange merchant ship gave us the coordinates to a planet not to far away from the Kar'Sai home system . And yet we managed to sneak an expedition ship there . <newline> <newline> To our suprise this planet was home to intelligent life . They called themselves humans . The first time we tried to make first contact they shot down our , luckily empty , landing ship . At this point in time we should have known better . <newline> <newline> The moment we were able to explaine our propostion to them they accepted . That should have been the second red flag . <newline> <newline> Their preparations started immediately after we gave them access to our method of faster than light travel . <newline> The humans send a group of millitary experts and weapons sepcialists to talk to our scientist and strategists . <newline> They even offered to take up refugees , some of us even chose to relocate to their planet , believing it was safer to hide close to our enemy . <newline> <newline> With our help and knowledge they immediately started to assemble warships armed to their teeth . Specifically our knowledge of superconductors and magnetism enabled them to build weapons we had never even dreamt of . They refitted some of our old ships and even started to build their own . Mounting giant weapons on some of them others were designed to host hundreds of smaller spacecraft just large enough for one human . <newline> <newline> After our negotioations they told us about their history , and apparently they had been at war with each other for most of their history . Sometimes over resources othertimes over mating rights the reasons were endless , the time this species had spend thinking about diffrent ways of killing each other was unparalleled . <newline> <newline> And so they came up with the most horiffic weapons . <newline> <newline> However building a fleet takes time and so the war between us and the Kar'Sai waged on . And it was going terrible for us . <newline> <newline> We had lost contact to almost all of our colonies and had sensor data on a very large Kar'Sai fleet that was making their way to our home system . They entered our system and all of us abandoned the hope that the humans would arrive in time to save us . Our last defensive effort failed and we were ready to surrender the moment the Kar'Sai ships aligned to bombard our home planet . <newline> <newline> That was the moment the humans arrived . They had prepared an ambush and the Kar'Sai were not prepared for a real confrontation . And even for a people as warlike as the Kar'Sai the humans were no match . They had armed their ships to the teeth with large preojectile weapons and very precise Laser weaponry . They tore some of the Kar'Sai ships to pieces others were almost melted by the large amount of plasma bombs that were dropped on them by the tiny , one man spacecraft . The humans even took some of the Kar'Sai ships in melee reclaiming them . They had used our technology to build personalized armored suits for their boarding squads . <newline> <newline> <newline> That day th humans had not only saved our home system but they had also made it a witness to the worst slaughter the galaxy had ever seen . The humans intented to kill every last Kar'Sai . Later they told us that this number did n't even compare to the wars on their home planet . We were chilled , the largest fight in our history had killed about 10,000 individuals . <newline> <newline> The humans however killed every Kar'Sai present in our system . Except one . Apparently this was part of their strategy , I believe it was part of their culture . He was supposed to tell the stories to his kin . <newline> <newline> The humans continued to fight this way . Eventhough the Kar'Sai were no longer so careless , they were slaughtered . And so the humans continued to liberate all of our colonies and anybody else subjugated by the Kar'Sai . We were delighted and terrified by their efffeciency . <newline> <newline> But suddenly everything changed , for the first time the Kar'Sai had managed to get in contact with the humans , and the fighting halted . They realized something . They were cloesely related . It was even possible to mate between the species . Something that the known universe had never observed . <newline> <newline> That day the fate of the galaxy was decided , and I am responsible . <newline>

0,"Delegate Zrook scuttled to the speaking desk . All the true legislative hurdles had been cleared and now the final vote to arm humanity with FTL technology and the best weapons the Dezl Republic had to offer was about to be taken . As was custom the losing side in the debate was given the floor to make one final plea for their side . <newline> <newline> “ My fellow citizens I ask of you so very much . I understand why my words have fallen on mostly deaf ears until now , but now in this late hour I beg all of you to hear me out just this once. ” He began . <newline> <newline> “ Yes my friends the swift and devastating attacks of the FayRoZk have been worse than we ever could have imagined , the carnage left in their wake is unspeakable , their crimes too legion to count . It is in times like these that a desperate people do desperate things without worry for the future. ” He paused and drank a purple liquid from a glass . <newline> <newline> “ But the path we are about to take is one filled with terrible consequences . For as barbaric and terrible as the FayRoZk are the Human race is ten times worse . On no other planet in the known galaxy has there ever been a more violent race of sentient beings . Skin color , gender , sexual orientation , believing the wrong religion , and even worse , believing the right religion but practicing it slightly differently are all reasons for people to kill on this planet . These are beasts who split the atom only with the intent of better murdering each other . We are about to ally ourselves with monsters from out worst nightmares. ” <newline> <newline> He glared at the other members of the legislature with his piercing all yellow eyes and defied any of them to make eye contact with him . None bothered to take him up on the challenge . <newline> <newline> “ For what ? Another hundred years ? Beasts like the Humans can not be constrained , they can not be kept in line . On their own planet they kill for whatever commodity it is they value . Once unleashed upon the stars they will kill to take anything and everything they want . What if it is our land , our riches they seek ? Are we really this craven , this cowardly to try to save our generation from the FayRoZk just to force future generations to fight back the war machine that is Humanity ? ” <newline> <newline> “ My brothers and sisters . Humanity is not the only option . Yes we have lost much in this war , but look at the resistance at Fizbill ! Look at the incredible damage we ’ ve inflicted at Retdear 4 ! Yes it is likely the FayRoZk may be able to begin orbital bombardment of our home world , but they don ’ t have the supply lines or troops needed for an invasion . It is an invasion that may never come , and if it did come we would drive it back ! ” He shouted , trying to embolden his people to weather the coming storm . <newline> <newline> “ And even if , even if we were to fall , even if the Dezl were to be conquered , should we not fight as warriors , as people who stood their ground and did honor to themselves and to their heritage . Can we not be the last ray of sunshine in the darkness , fighting through the clouds to show itself ? Are we so important that we must protect ourselves at all costs ? Are there not dozens of other empires beyond the reach of the FayRoZk who might become targets of Humanity should we take the easy way out ? What will the history of the galaxy say of us in a thousand years ? Will it speak of a people who fought with honor and dignity , or will it speak of the enablers of the great terror that scourges the cosmos ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I know you know what is right . I plead with you to do what is right . The easy path only looks easy , but is the path to ruin . The hard path offers us no promise of salvation , no promise that the Dezl will even continue to exist , or if we do , to be anything more than slaves , but it is that path that we must walk . You know this in your hearts , that the burden of fighting the FayRoZk is ours and ours alone . We will rise or fall by our merits , by our will . This is what we must do. ” <newline> <newline> His voice cracking , his body trembling he finally finished . “ We can not arm the Humans , we must not. ” He said and with that he walked away from the speaking desk . <newline> <newline> The resolution to grant the Humans FTL technology and arm them as best as the Dezl Republic could passed 214-82 . Afterwards three voters said Zrook ’ s speech made them change their minds and vote no . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

0,"I 'm way late to the party but I figured I 'd give this one a shot . I do n't know if anyone will read this but it 's actually my first post here on WritingPrompts so I hope that maybe someone will read it and possibly even like it . Here goes nothing : <newline> <newline> <newline> The dangers of our experiment were known . All of the civilizations in the Galactic Alliance had lost the taste for war . No species joined the GA with a desire to conquer . New members were far and few between . Though it hadn ’ t been proven the assumption was always that a species would have to advance past the self-destructive stages in evolution in order to uncover the secrets of interstellar travel . Unfortunately this process seemed to leave us all with a very similar mindset despite the vast physiological differences . There was still so much left to learn , so much more we wanted to know , and of course the problem of overpopulation . Despite our formidable technology we were still unable to leave the galaxy . The others are just too far away . <newline> <newline> <newline> The GA High Counsel would never have approved of our testing so a decision was made to carry it out in secret . The idea was simple . If the evolutionary process which leads to a space-faring species always results in analogous psychologies maybe additional knowledge could be gained by ushering in a less developed culture . Plans were drawn and methods were discussed at great length . We were willing to take risks but we weren ’ t suicidal . There were several options but ultimately the Hoilerfots were selected . Their evolution was nearly complete ; the prediction for their arrival at the Galactic Welcome Station only several centuries . They didn ’ t fight amongst themselves much . The risks were calculated to be minimal . We cloaked ourselves and made our way to Alirfest . Though they had terraformed and colonized a few planets in their system the central government was still maintained on their home world despite it being a Jovian moon . It took us half a century to educate them enough for our ruse to succeed . We supplied them with the technology , taught them how to use it and gave them just enough information to find the GAHQ . Our excitement bred hubris . We never expected the coup . <newline> <newline> <newline> The Hoilerfot rebels allowed their central government to make contact before assassinating their leaders . We couldn ’ t understand their motives . Their character was just too different . We offered them everything yet they chose to take all they could . Their greed was outweighed only by their cruelty . In just a century and a half they had driven the entirety of the GA back to their original systems . It seems we had found an answer to the problem of overpopulation . Our guilt drove us to despair . If we hadn ’ t acted on our own the stakes now wouldn ’ t be so dire . In our desperation we turned back to our pre-selection studies . It was clear that none of us could defeat the Hoilerfots . There was , however , a species whose ruthlessness exceeded that of the Hoilerfots . <newline> <newline> <newline> Humanity was deemed a lost cause . Members of the GA had attempted to interfere on several occasions . Each time the savior sent was murdered and wars were waged in their names . Their self-destruction was predicted to be a mere century away . What had we left to lose ? The level of threat was astronomical but what did the odds matter in the face of galactic extinction ? At this rate within the next millennium the galactic xenocides would be complete . The Hoilerfots would be the only interstellar civilization . The GAHC was contacted . There would be no secrecy this time . The vote was unanimous . A representative from each civilization would be sent to the Sol system . The humans had only colonized their Earth ’ s moon and their neighboring planet , Mars . Overpopulation was a problem for them , too . They still waged wars . Their tactics were barbaric . They fought us upon arrival . Despite our advantages they held us off for years . They gave up only when our technological superiority had been proven . After their surrender our occupation was swift . We explained to them our situation and offered them a covenant ; the key to the galaxy in exchange for their military expertise . As the humans would say , a deal with the devil had been struck . Humanity swore they would create a galactic “ pax romana ” but we had little faith . Still , better to submit to Humanity ’ s imperialism than face extinction at the hands of the Hoilerfots . With the humans in command the galactic civil war lasted less than a century . Despite our protests the Hoilerfots were exterminated completely . The humans had deemed them to great a threat . With the Human Hegemony firmly established and reconstruction under way just one question remained unanswered . Was this to be the beginning or the end ? <newline>

0,"`` Shit , we 're late ! '' Thatcher stammered as he rolled out of bed . His roommate Parston was jolted awake , hitting his head on the light above his bed . `` Dammit , you 're human side is rubbing off on me . '' <newline> <newline> `` You were boring before we met . '' Thatch retorted with a grin . `` I was a responsible Promethian '' Parsa replied . `` Haha , not something to be proud of . We 're not late yet , hustle up ! '' said Parsa as he threw on a dirty shirt and ran out the door . <newline> <newline> `` Good Afternoon class , hope you all had a lovely weekend , today we will be finishing up our unit of the Second Galactic War . '' said Professor Wassermann-Green as she took her place at the lectern . The class quieted down and Parsa and Thatch made it to their usual spots and through themselves down , still out of breath from their run across camps . <newline> <newline> `` Today we will discuss the surrender and liberation of the Atlatican stronghold world Mecone and the resulting peace negotiations ... ... picking up where we left off , the commander of the Atlaticans forces met aboard the Earth ship , the Orestes , where the Decree of Mecone was signed officially ending conflict in the sector . For our class , we will focus on the Articles of surrender which were largely based on the Articles of Alliance between the Humans and Prometheans '' <newline> <newline> `` Remember that our Articles of Alliance were based upon a mutually beneficial agreement that strengthened both Humans and Promethean , integrating both our forces and our societies , creating a vibrant and diverse culture and bringing out the best in both of us . '' <newline> <newline> `` The Atlanicans had less to atone for , despite being largely victorious in battle . They had an admirable fighting spirit but did not resort to the desperate and shameful tactics of the Promethean . Humans were able to serve as an objective arbiter in the surrender which allowed for the Promethians to apologize in victory and the Atlanticans to retain their dignity . It is considered a great moment for both civilizations ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Next week , we will be covering the Promethean atonement acts , from the enslavement of the lower cast Promethians in the problematic hierarchical , pre-human society to the apartheid tactics during the war . Remember to do the reading ! '' With that , Professor Wasserman-Green left the lectern and began conversing with her graduate students , almost all human . <newline> <newline> Parsa turned to Thatch , `` Why does she always leave out all the shit the Atlaticans did , the Massacres , the mutation virus , they even glassed an entire planet . It 's always our shit . War is hell , humans said that first . '' <newline> <newline> Thatch looked a bit uneasy , `` ya , but you guys we 're pretty fucked up before we got here ... ... you have to admit that '' <newline> <newline> `` I guess , but it 's not like humans are much better , look at the Prof. *ALL* of her grad students are humans , one one Promethian and he 's a lower cast ... ... . '' <newline> <newline> `` Shut up about the caste , that 's ignorant and backwards . Besides , we got drinking to do ! '' Thatch responded <newline> <newline> `` I do n't really want to man , I 'm not feeling that good . '' replied Parsa . <newline> <newline> `` Whatever , go home and pout . '' shouted Thatch as he ran off . <newline> <newline> Parsa made his way back to his dorm and logged on to infinitychan : the last bastion of free speech^TM . <newline> <newline> Hoping for something new , he was discouraged that it was just Promethians bitching about the Humans . An echo chamber of : `` We may have won , but life sucks . `` , `` Humans have all the good jobs , whats the point of getting rid of casts if its just humans taking the top spots . `` , `` Promethians went from warriors to fat slobs in one generation . `` , `` We ca n't even quote Lord Commander Vors without being arrested , wtf humans ? `` , `` Promethean support for the military and defense participation at all time low . '' Parsa let out a long apathetic sigh and went to join his friend at the bar . <newline> <newline> <newline> Meanwhile , at remote Atlatican transfer station between human and Atlatican space , a lone Atlatican in military garb sat in an lavish conference room that had no business in such a humble facility . A large door at the far end opened and a towering figure emerged into the light . With brilliant golden hair and finely crafted ornamental armour , the God-Emperor of the Humans , Donald Trump approached the loan figure . <newline> <newline> `` Commander Fark , our work is done , begin the assault . The Promethians are a mess , believe me . They wo n't put up a fight . '' <newline> <newline>

0,"Growing pains . That was what we called it . That was what we called it for centuries . Even when they expanded into space . Even when they transformed their bodies of water into ones made of synthetics . Even when they carved up their neighboring planets to turn into habitable colonies . Even as they closed off their small section of space behind curtains of metal and light , we insisted , growing pains . After all , their constant infighting was something all of the races had done at some point or another . The humans simply needed a little more time than others , they were a little special . They had been isolated all their lives off in some little known , strange part of space , not like the rest of us . Perhaps by the time they revealed themselves , they would be ready to join the rest of us in the Federation . <newline> <newline> That was what we were hoping for when we traveled to the edge of their space and asked for entry . Our small team of ambassadors were met by a human clad in gold and white that flowed from his body . He and his entourage received us with open arms and loud guttural roars . Some of us quaked in fear , even after learning it was a sign of joy . <newline> <newline> They held great celebrations in our name , cheered our - apparently difficult - names with frightening fervor , and pampered us with treatment that was beyond our wildest dreams . We were offered their finest foods , bountiful gifts , and the most beautiful - or so they claimed - companions they had to offer . They did n't even know why we had come ! Once we explained the terms of our trade , their allegiance for our technology , they acted exactly as we had come to expect , by throwing another celebration . This one was much grander than any other we had experienced , the scale was unprecedented . We quickly came to learn that entire planets and solar systems were celebrating . As the man in white and gold explained to me , it was a grand sendoff for their warriors as they marched off on a crusade . I tried to explain to them that the Quintal were terrifying opponents , that their capacity for mastering new technologies was beyond anything the rest of the universe could possibly comprehend and that all the Federation could n't even muster a defense . The man in white and gold smiled and petted me on the head before stepping out to address his subjects . <newline> <newline> They were like children ! I had thought that perhaps we had made a terrifying mistake . That perhaps the humans had forgotten what war was . I watched as their soldiers entered massive machines made in their own image . They were fit to be art ! Grandiose and hedonistic like everything else about their culture . The thought of colorful , giant metal humans flying through space was hilarious ! The humans mistook my laughter for cheering and laughed with me as a machine clad in white and blue marched by , waving at us . <newline> <newline> I was so foolish . <newline> <newline> When we had offered them our FTL technology we did n't understand . We did n't understand anything ! We did n't understand why they were so eager to join a battle that was n't their own . We did n't understand why they were willing to throw away their lives when they could have lived in their bubble for years to come . We did n't understand how the Quintal had advanced so quickly in such little time . We did n't understand why the Quintals kept such a long distance from the humans ' walls . We did n't understand that humans could be so devious . <newline> <newline> War was just child 's play to the humans . They played around and toyed with the Quintals . They would send out their man-shaped machines and smash and wreck and violate everything they could lay their hands on , and when they were done they would eradicate everything and everyone . It was easy when their most basic war machines could deliver payloads directly into cockpits , bridges , and engines . Our technology was a joke to them ; the trade was a mere excuse . <newline> <newline> At first , the man in white never failed to thank us and the Federation for the technology we gave them . The lip service , however , quickly changed to speeches about being `` delivered from evil '' and being `` saved '' . It was n't long before the human word , `` Savior '' , became the favorite word of every Federation citizen . Humans quickly became the hot topic and they could do no wrong . When the Quintals were nearly eradicated they deserved it ! When the Quintal survivors were interned the humans were being merciful and gracious . When someone was imprisoned for criticizing the humans they were criminals that needed to be removed from society . When the rebels declared war against the human-led Federation , it was time to celebrate .

0,"The tight-beam message did not arrive until minutes after the first rounds struck . We watched aghast as atmospheres burned and continental plates buckled across a dozen homeworlds , 1.3 trillion Illarian lives reduced to lumps of fused silicon in seconds . We reeled again as sensors around each planet relayed signatures of exotic radioactive materials , informing us that even if the surfaces of the planets remained solid they would be uninhabitable for thousands of Standard Cycles . As we traced the rays of radioactivity and warp signatures that terminated on our shattered , poisoned worlds , we found that they did not emanate from the direction of the Cfuuite battlefront , but from the vicinity of a dim yellow star in a sector that had been alpha-level quarantined since the Illarians were first granted access to the Galactic Database . With every available sensor trained on this unassuming sun , when the message arrived it was heard throughout the entirety of Illarian controlled space . <newline> <newline> The creature that appeared on the holo-screens appeared to be made up of a number of metallic or chitinous plates that overlapped to form a vertically oriented torso with what appeared to be *bilateral* symmetry . The head of the creature was a disproportionately small , squishy looking thing that protruded vulnerably from its otherwise rugged-looking shell , topped with a shock of short greyish-brown fur . As it moved its mandibles ( it *was* squishy ! ) a universal translator of Cfuuite design floated into view , and began to repeat the message in the synthesized , slightly-garbled Old Illarian typical of the Cfuuite negotiation proxies . <newline> <newline> `` I am Rear Admiral Aurelius Berthold , speaking on behalf of the United Planetary Federation of Sol . By the time you receive this message , every Illarian body with an atmosphere will be in flames . by the time I have finished relaying our ultimatum , gamma ray weapons will have shredded every strand of DNA in the region if space that you so recently `` captured '' from the Cfuuite Coalition . You have been stripped of your home worlds and your battle fleet . If you immediately cease hostilities with all Cfuuite Coalition species and agree to unconditional surrender of all Illarian controlled planetary bodies and the resources therein , there is still time to divert the hypervelocity missiles closing on your orbital habitats . You have ninety minutes ( '1.847 Standard Hours ' , the universal translator chimed helpfully ) to comply . '' <newline> <newline> As the screen went blank , a stunned silence filled the command center . I gazed around the room , realizing with three heavy hearts that the 4,500 Illarian commanders , officers , and aides living in the Drozrizi Orbital Defense Station now accounted for almost 5 % of our species . The war with the Cfuuite Coalition had been in its final days , but it was clear that our defeat was now as certain as theirs had been an hour before . <newline> <newline> Alarms began to sound as long-range telescopes detected the engine flares of twelve planet-killing weapons that had already arrived . The signature of Cfuuite Coalition warp drives was unmistakable . I looked down at the world I had hatched on , now marred with an angry red hole and a wall of fire that collided and rebounded off itself as it seared across the landscape for a second time . The mighty Illarian empire was gone , the species reduced to a handful of refugees in less time and with the same apparent ease as a Ch'Koriri hunt . The Galactic Council would surely sanction the Cfuuite Coalition for making contact with an alpha-level quarantined species , but I was no longer sure it mattered . These creatures of Sol had been given the technology to escape their enforced isolation , and announced their presence by annihilating a civilization over thirty thousand Standard Cycles old . I began to weep , not for my atomized brood mates below , nor even my shattered species . Our ambitions had pushed the Cfuuites to an act of desperation , and the galaxy would surely pay the price for our sins . <newline> <newline> Epilogue - <newline> <newline> 1.847 Standard hours later , a salvo of hypervelocity missiles streaked past the remaining Illarian orbital facilities and impacted redundantly on the devastated planets they circled . Seven solar years earlier , Rear Admiral Aurelius Berthold switched off his video feed and confirmed at a nearby terminal that the hypervelocity missiles and accompanying auto-ambassador launched six months earlier were functioning properly . Satisfied , he shrugged off his gleaming ceremonial power armor and sank heavily into the leather chair behind his desk . With the contented air that always followed a successful 'negotiation ' session , he poured himself two generous fingers of Martian scotch , took an appreciative sniff , and reached across his desk for a small dossier labelled `` Galactic Database - Summary of Listed Earthlike Planets '' . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- <newline> <newline> I 've never done one of these before , but the prompt captured my imagination . Let me know how I did ! I 'll keep my eye on the prompts coming in , and maybe I 'll be back .

0,"The towers were under siege . The walls were falling . The Philka were pouring through the outer gates . Their siege cannons pounded on the shields of the keep . <newline> <newline> `` Defend the Queen ! '' yelled the captain of the guard . Gathering what remained of the force rifles , the soldiers arranged themselves at the windows , firing down on the Philka ground troops . A few were knocked down , but their armor was far too strong . They were n't dying . <newline> <newline> In the throne room , Queen Tehana watched the skies . Soon the *Swiftfoot* would return . It would bring either help or nothing . Her counselors had warned her against contact with the blue planet , but she had been left with no choice . Now , she saw that it scarcely mattered . the Philka had found some material on their conquest that made their armor impenetrable . They had no need of shields , and their plasma throwing siege cannons cast glowing balls of death through the skies . The Phika themselves preferred to kill with their sharp blades . What help could anyone give , least of all a people with only one planet . <newline> <newline> She stepped out onto the balcony as the Philka arrayed themselves before the keep . Her troops were all that stood between the enemy and the innocent . The boom of a wormhole drew everyone 's attention to the sky . The *Swiftfoot* had returned . Everyone saw the result of its mission . It was alone . <newline> <newline> Her men steeled themselves for the final attack as the Philka began chanting their war song . They were preparing to charge . The Queen , however did n't take her eyes of the sky . She had seen something else . A shimmer of light . Something had entered the atmosphere . Something small . There were more shimmers . <newline> <newline> Something large and metal slammed into the ground , right in the middle of the Philka . The impact sent them flying away and brought the chant to a halt . The sound of more impacts sounded all around . <newline> <newline> In a flash , they were among the troops , with roaring weapons and swift movements . They were not using energy weapons , nor swords . They had something else . Then a whine of engines sounded as some kind of tiny ship flew into view , spinning , then hovering over the battlefield . The buzz of its weapons drowned out all else . <newline> <newline> The Philka were dying . Not one by one in battle , but en mass . They were not being pushed back , they were being slaughtered . <newline> <newline> The Queen 's troops were frozen in shock . They had never seen such death , even among the Philka . The new soldiers annihilated the enemy , then approached the keep . <newline> <newline> They were efficient , wasting no time as they cleared the towers and secured the Queen . One asked in perfect Kandarian , `` Where are the civilians located ? '' <newline> <newline> `` In the city , behind the heavy shields . '' said the Queen . <newline> <newline> The soldier nodded , then spoke into a communicator of some kind . <newline> <newline> It happened then . <newline> As if the sky had split open to reveal it , a monolith appeared in the sky . It was a massive ship , dwarfing the *Swiftfoot* as it slowly moved across the sky . It 's enormous siege cannons fired on the Philka ships , tearing them apart with ease . Then the guns turned to the land forces . <newline> <newline> `` Is this Earth 's warfare ? '' asked the Queen , a hint of disdain in her voice . <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' said the human , `` And soon , your war will be over . '' he pointed towards the shielded city . `` They only live because of that warfare . '' <newline> <newline> `` I wonder how long before we are overwhelmed by you humans . '' mused the queen , `` How long before I regret this decision . '' <newline> <newline> The human stopped and stared at her . `` Seriously ? '' he said , `` We just saved your life and you 're already pulling this ? You have nothing we need apart from FTL tech . You 're army was defeated by *iron armor* for god 's sake . How the hell you invented space travel with so few natural resources , we 'll never know . '' <newline> <newline> `` So few.. '' said the queen , `` You mean you have more ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry , your majesty . '' said the human as he walked away , `` It 's a big galaxy , you wo n't have to deal with us if you do n't want to . '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait . '' said the Queen as she followed him , `` What natural resources *do* you have ? '' <newline> <newline> EDIT : Story continued [ Here ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/Capntal/comments/2qjh3k/the_nomads_part_i/ )

0,"Mr. James Morrigan strode down the hall *with a purpose* , which is to say that he was very nearly running , his shoes clicking loudly on the tile floor . Staffers glared at him as he passed them and a couple shushed , but they had to be ignored . Sometimes , even a junior staffer has matters of life and death to attend to . <newline> <newline> He flung open the doors to the Cabinet Chamber grandly , ignoring even the Presidential Honor Guard , and announced quite loudly , <newline> <newline> `` Ms. President Paiement , the General Ambassador of the Fragmathians requests your attention on matters relating to the Gramarrian Police Action and is expecting an immediate conference . '' <newline> <newline> President Paiement glowered over her spectacles at me while the various Cabinet members gaped . <newline> <newline> `` Ca n't you see I 'm in the middle of a Cabinet meeting ? The Parliment and Houses of Lords of the Federated Worlds of La Galaxie en Lait is expecting a policy statement on the Granttain Colonies heroin epidemic this evening . We do n't have time for the Fragmathians and their war right now . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ms. President , I was not seeking to ask your permission on behalf of Their Grandness Sir Windiness Krashtheet , but informing you that he has arrived and will be here momentarily . '' <newline> <newline> As the President sighed heavily and rested her head in her hands , the unmistakable sounds of a number of heavily armed guards politely trying not to create an interstellar incident drifted in from the hall . After a couple more awkward moments , a small contingent of Fragmathian Civil Guard burst through the door with Their Grandness Krashtheet in their midst . He did n't waste any time with his business , either . Stabbing at the table with a sharp , fur fringed finger , he erupted at the President , his typically gentle drone a steely roar . <newline> <newline> `` We asked for your aid against the Gramarrians to save our people . While you sit and twitch your tails and groom yourselves , my kind are dying at their hands ! Where is the aid you promised ? Where is the war ? '' <newline> <newline> The President looked up at him , pulled off her glasses , and fixed him with a cool , steady gaze . She waited a beat and responded . <newline> <newline> `` Their Grandness Krashtheet . This is most irregular . Interrupting a Cabinet Meeting ? You know better . '' <newline> <newline> While Their Grandness fished for a response , the President stood up and languidly spread her arms , dismissing the Cabinet . <newline> <newline> `` Meeting adjourned . Meet back here in two hours . '' <newline> `` Ambassador Krashtheet . Come with me to my office and we will discuss this . '' <newline> <newline> The Ambassador did not like that a bit . <newline> <newline> `` No ! , '' he roared . `` No ! We can not waste a moment while my packmates and my worlds packmates die . We will meet NOW ! '' <newline> <newline> The remaining Cabinet members flinched and moved to scuttle from the room even faster . The President put her glasses back on . <newline> <newline> `` So be it . '' <newline> <newline> `` You promised military aid to defeat the Gramarrians . You promised to help us utterly destroy them . You have not done that . You are among the oldest of the species of the galaxy and certainly the most powerful . You could wipe them out of existence with a gesture . But you sit and scratch your privates while Fragmathian kits and their mothers are killed in their dens . You break your promises and lie like a *kwaeseae* , a packless cur . What good is your vaunted peace if your words are burrow filth ? '' <newline> <newline> The President took her glasses off again and put them in her pocket . She sighed and walked over to the Ambassador Their Greatness Krashtheet . Putting her arm around his shoulders , she said <newline> <newline> `` Come with me . I will explain to you who we are , for you have not truly seen us . Send away your guard . '' <newline> <newline> She led him through the door at the head of the table into the Oval Office and opened the drapery with a tired gesture , ignoring his indignant splutters . <newline> <newline> `` When you look at the Earth , what do you see , Ambassador ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I see a green world that has always astonished me for its verdance and life that looks as if a galactic power had never found it . I see thousands of trade ships moving in space around it , but I do not see where they go . A prosperous , bustling planet of *kwaeseae* that do not care if another Fragmathian city is destroyed by the Gramarrian hoard ! I see a lying government that loves its 'peace ' more than the lives of others . '' <newline> <newline> More to come but I 've got to work now ...

0,"Humans ... the very name of that race brings both fear and awe to the many races of the galaxy . For a millenium we watched them , studied them . For such a short lived species they were very accomplished , growing in technology and understanding faster than most other races we had observed . They advanced quickly ... but thankfully not fast enough to leave their planet . And so we watched them , seeing the potential their species could bring to our Galactic Federation . <newline> <newline> They were intelligent , there was no question about that . But they used their intelligence to fight . With each of their wars , no matter the reason for them , humans created more efficient ways to kill each other . We often wondered what humans could do if they had directed their intelligence towards peace rather than war . How far could they come ? <newline> <newline> We spent a great deal of time trying to groom them towards the greater good of the galaxy . Sending envoys disguised as humans to preach messages of peace and brotherhood . We soon discovered our mistake as these messages were taken for far more than enlightenment . They were used as tools to control , as excuses to commit horrific acts upon each other . We stopped , but it was already too late . <newline> <newline> The splitting of the atom caught us all by surprise . The level of technological sophistication required to split the building blocks of the universe should have taken them at least another thousand years . But it was apparent to those who observed that humanity was on track to reach the stars and perhaps beyond . <newline> <newline> We watched as their technology grew by leaps and bounds . Those of us who were sent to observe them up close reported that their minds were continually thinking star ward . There were many that hated the current state of the wars and the death . We quietly encouraged them , eventually pushing forward a dream of a unified humanity that had finally joined with the stars . Sadly the man we encouraged perished and upon his death others took up his reins . Slowly , they returned to themes that more readily identified with the masses rather than the dreamers . <newline> <newline> Eventually our observations were needed elsewhere . The sudden arrival of the Varlani caught us by surprise . For generations our Galactic Federation had coexisted peacefully with the other powers of the Galaxy . Our vigilance had suffered from the peace and we quickly found ourselves on the losing end of a horrific war . <newline> <newline> We fought and we died . Slowly our worlds fell to the Varlani . We had been at peace for too long . Our thirst for war had been quenched by the nectars of peace . <newline> <newline> It was then the last observer of humanity spoke up . A race such as theirs was capable of waging the war we could not . There was much debate in the Galactic Council for many days . And for each day that went by , hundreds of worlds fell . Eventually it was agreed that first contact would be made . We would seek the help of these humans and hope that the faith of the observers would be found to have merit . <newline> <newline> Our contact did not go exactly as we had imagined . For generations there were those among the population that guessed at our existence . We were met by a frenzy of questions and skepticism . Though in the end , we were able to finally meet their leaders . Our conditions were simple . In exchange for our technology , Earth would join the Galactic Federation . They would contribute to war effort we had fought for generations and once the war was over , they would be treated as an equal member of our Federation with all the rights associated with that title . <newline> <newline> We should have known that their eagerness to join would have consequences ... <newline> <newline> But we were desperate . <newline> <newline> Humans filled our ranks quickly , bringing their expertise and blood thirst for war to bolster our exhausted soldiers . The effect was immediate . With only a few months training , human crews began to overtake our experienced crews in their daring and creativity . The tide began to turn as humans pushed the Varlani back . Reports from the front told of human soldiers valiantly sacrificing themselves to save their comrades . Of human ferocity in the face of withering fire and of human ingenuity in the face of dire disadvantages . <newline> <newline> We had our warriors and we had won . <newline> <newline> The Varlani retreated from our galaxy , never to be seen again . Earth was officially welcomed into the Federation . To our surprise they took to the organization quite easily , with some humans speaking of an entertainment show they had seen as children that mirrored us . <newline> <newline> Perhaps allowing humans in was n't such a bad idea . But why do I have doubts ?

0,"4288 AD – When the Rykis attacked , we were unprepared . Our race believes in peace and cooperation , so our only weapons were mining lasers and meteor screens . We were unable to establish communication with these alien invaders , and lost a dozen of colonies by the first year . <newline> <newline> 4292 AD – The Rykis continues their destruction . Our scientists have deciphered their language and have attempted to communicate . The Rykis now acknowledge our intelligence , but as we are unable to give them any reason to stop their advance , continues to enslave our lands . We are desperately trying to research defensive weaponry to protect our people . I hope for the best . <newline> <newline> 4298 AD – Defensive weaponry has proved to be too little , too late . A quarter of our civilization has been wiped out . Will this be the end of our great civilization ? <newline> <newline> 4301 AD – The galaxy-wide vote concluded yesterday , and it proposition passed by less than one percent . A radical suggestion , born out of desperation . Our explorers have found a planet populated by a species of aliens that have fought with each other for thousands of years . They have rudimentary intra-stellar travel , but do not have FTL technology . We will contact their people and propose a trade : help us fend off the Rykis in exchange for technology . We will provide them with the necessary material and technology . I personally voted against such a proposal . What are we if we decide to abandon our roots ? <newline> <newline> 4302 AD – The ‘ humans ’ of ‘ Earth ’ have accepted our proposition . Less than half of our original worlds remain free . <newline> <newline> 4303 AD – The first human warships have launched from Earth . <newline> <newline> 4303 AD ( cont . ) – The Rykis raiders were taken by surprise and retreated ! The human ships are crude , yet effective . I hope for the best . <newline> <newline> 4304 AD – As I feared , the Rykis were not so easily defeated . Human fleets are fighting a losing war , but their researchers and engineers continue to improve on their designs . They have colonized two planets within their system , which will increase their production . <newline> <newline> 4306 AD – Our great civilization is left with less than a dozen worlds . But there has been a turning point . A great battle took place in the skies above our homeworld . Both sides were prepared , yet the humans prevailed ! Dare we hope for the best ? <newline> <newline> 4311 AD – The humans continue to recapture enslaved worlds from the Rykis . Reunited families cry with the survivors and weep for the dead . <newline> <newline> 4314 AD – The last enslaved world has been returned to us ! Every border world is now protected by a great human fleet : its fighters faster than the Rykis ’ , its missile cruisers with greater range than the Rykis ’ , its battleships sturdier than the Rykis ’ . <newline> <newline> 4316 AD – The humans continue on into Rykis territory . Our people are divided . Some cheer the humans on , lusting for revenge . Others , like me , who cling on to our traditional ways of peace and communication . The human no longer need our technology or materials to build their warships . Their knowledge of weaponry has long surpassed our own , and they accrue necessary material from their own colonies , and now , the Rykis ’ planets . <newline> <newline> 4322 AD – The Rykis homeworld has fallen . The human fleets continue to protect our space from “ other unknown enemies , ” according to their ambassador . <newline> <newline> 4336 AD – I fear we are losing our identity . Human “ advisors ” are in all aspects of our lives , urging us to “ work harder ” and “ donate to the cause. ” They are also suggesting we form a “ government , ” to easier handle the needs of our people . <newline> <newline> 4337 AD – Our people have adopted what the humans call “ politics ” and “ government. ” The humans have offered to provide advisors to help us with the transition . I hope for the best . <newline> <newline> 4338 AD – In order to reduce confusion between our races , our government has decided to adopt the human calendar . This diary will be retroactively updated with the correct times . <newline> <newline> 4343 AD – We are truly losing our identity . The younger generation copies the mannerism of the humans , believing that the culture of our savior is superior . It does not help that our education system has been reformed to include the feats of the humans , claiming that “ our people would not be alive today if not for the humans. ” <newline> <newline> 4347 AD – “ English ” has been mandated as the official language . I continue to hope for the best . <newline>

0,"The examination confirmed it , and took away the last vestige of doubt . <newline> <newline> We had assumed after the first few encounters that it was some property of their outer shell that made them immune to our weaponry , but no this was not the case . The outer shell is not part of the creature , it is not some extruded exoskeleton or dermal filter , it is a manufactured object . The reason that weapons do n't work against them is that they ca n't , their biology is wrong . <newline> <newline> It should have been obvious , it should have jumped out to those first pioneers that this was something different , this was something sprouted from a different root , cut to a different pattern . But they looked so much like the Anskarii it was just assumed they were a degenerate offshoot . Those eyes , the thick limbs , and hairless faces , the tiny feet . The way they hunted us with their sonic weapons every time we landed . <newline> <newline> Of course we just threw a cordon around the place , a warning to others and never went back . <newline> <newline> If we had , maybe things could have been different , maybe if we could have found a way to communicate we would have discovered ... but no , perhaps this was the best way , as a creature so toxic , so alien , must be a thing of last choice . <newline> It is said by the church that the records found in the Anskarii ship are a miracle , so an intervention by the god 's to stop us learning more about them is not too far fetched . Perhaps the miracle is that we did not understand them until we needed to understand them . <newline> <newline> You have all seen the Pioneer footage , the one called The Scream ? <newline> This is where the first mistakes were made . It was Pioneer Versal that was the issue not the orange chested predators , because the long bio-filaments hanging from him filtering the toxins ... well , when you are preserving your own life in an extremely toxic environment , it is not a good idea if your bio-filaments make you look like a local prey animal . <newline> <newline> But it was the data found on the Anskarii cruiser that finally sealed it . They had been visiting the planet for usual pre-invasion surveys , following the pattern that has seen them march across this arm of the galaxy in a grey-faced shiny-eyed wave , destroying all in their path . Those little grey bastards had been collecting these creatures using their usual fly-past method , you know , shoot down and scoop one up in some lonely out of the way area . Hit them with a biothermic beam and analyse the ashes . <newline> <newline> But the thing is , the biothermics were n't killing them , just ... just making them docile , confused . The data indicates that it was n't even a matter of frequency , or the amplitude , it just did n't kill them . They are chemically , physiologically ... fundamentally different . There is other data , footage , stuff that would blow your mind , the things they can do . <newline> When the Anskarii figured out that the Biothermics did n't work , they turned to sonics . There is this footage I have seen , rows of them sitting around the central rotunda of a C class research ship , the light glinting off those big weird eyes , and they have one of the creatures strapped to a table . Anyway , they wheel in a sonic cannon and hit it point-blank , not a pistol ... a cannon . <newline> <newline> The thing , it just ... it just goes crazy , rips through the strappings , jumps up and tears the head clean off the gunner . It is hard to see what happens after that , there are fluids on the lens of the recorder , but it cleared the entire ship in about an hour , just using it 's own limbs , just those tiny looking hands and feet , and we believe this was an immature female . <newline> <newline> Look ... this is the choice . Below us is a planet full of monsters , carbon based things that are so alien they can survive in an oxygen rich environment . Our technology has no effect on them , the most powerful weapons of our enemy send them into such an insane rage that they literally rip anyone in their path to pieces . Do we ignore them , do we try and hold back the Anskarii on our own , or do we contact them in their cities , in their nests and try to make a deal ? <newline> <newline> The thing is , I have no doubt that with their help we can defeat the old enemy , but what then , once these monsters , these humans are loose among the civilized peoples of the Galaxy , what then ?

0,"A bit late to this one , but hopefully y'all like it . <newline> <newline> Our worlds burned . The Coalition of Worlds was not enough . The Rahk'y were too numerous , their leaders too cunning . They were able to outmanuver our fleets , avoiding battle and preferring to jump behind our defensive lines , savaging the defenseless worlds . This tactic proved more that effective , and many of the sacked worlds withdrew from the Coalition , preferring the Rahk'y offer of `` peaceful servatude '' to the possibility of their world burning again . <newline> <newline> And it is in this time , when all seemed lost , our coalition faltering , our fleets deserting , our worlds burning , that we contacted the Humans . <newline> <newline> Before , we simply considered them as violent savages , more focused on death than life . They were also in a unique spot of a new race , having discovered basic atomics and on the verge of discovering higher atomics . Of course , we had no time to guide their advancement from afar , as was the custom for races such as the Humans , but we had a war to win , against an enemy almost a vicious as the Humans . <newline> <newline> So we took a risk . <newline> <newline> Diplomats were dispatched to Earth , offering FTL travel and the most modern weapons and armor on one condition : <newline> <newline> Humanity had to fight with us , against the Rahk'y . <newline> <newline> They accepted , with no hesitation . <newline> <newline> Their United Nations was able to get the support of their Security Council , and the Human race officially united , at least on paper . <newline> <newline> The Rahk'y were not out of the loop , though , and were more than happy to take another world . A fleet of 10 ships was sent to the Sol system , warping in just as our Delegation left . <newline> <newline> Earth burned . Like a thousand worlds before . The fleet was more than capable of taking on their outdated forces . The lights of Earth , once bright beacons of light , broadcasting humanity 's existence and progress , slowly dwindled , going out , one by one . <newline> <newline> Most races would simply surrender in these circumstances , accepting their place as a servant race , glad to simply survive . <newline> <newline> Humanity did n't . <newline> <newline> Even as their armies were defeated , one after another , they never thought of surrender . Even as their World Capitals burned , Humanity never stopped resisting . And as the Rahk'y began to feel secure in their new conquest , Humanity threw a curveball . <newline> <newline> Religion , long abandoned by many in the cosmos , was something that Humans had in spades . It provided something to look forward to , something to hope for , something worth fighting and dying for . The religious zeal of planet Earth proved it 's greatest strength , as a new Prophet emerged from the ether , preaching the gospel of freedom , resistance , and hope . Mixing his own beliefs with those already in existence , the Prophet , and he titled himself , saw his flock swell into the billions . It was under his leadership that Humanity modernized , won it 's first battles , and began to move out of her home system . <newline> <newline> They were able to turn the tied of the war . The fresh , zealous troops and battle-hardened generals pushed the Rahk'y back , one world at a time , until they had reach the Rahk'y homeworld . And the Prophet , the First Prophet , the Prophet of Rage , personally oversaw the attack on the world . <newline> <newline> What followed was one of the greatest war crimes ever committed . Humanity swept from the skies , destroying the tattered remains of the defense forces , and turned their weapons on the civilians of the world . The cities burned to ashes , and were followed by the smaller towns , and they were followed by any remaining settled area . <newline> <newline> In a single act , Humanity had ended a civilization . <newline> <newline> Some critics of the Coalition ask why we did n't stop them . But by the time of the Rahk'y atrocity , 65 % of Coalition forces were human , and the remaining non-human forces had been fighting for at least a decade . Our troops were not ready to fight an enemy in the beginning of their Golden Age . <newline> <newline> And with the end of the war , Humanity was the largest of Coalition races , holding thousands of Worlds and trillions of souls . And it is here , Humanity again shows their nature . While the worlds of the Coalition were recovering , Humanity sent to his weakened allies a gift . Aid . The race that had just completed a crusade with the eradication of a civilization had just shared some of her prosperity with the rest of the cosmos .

0,"We had n't announced anything , but we were losing . Badly . People could tell as more and more worlds were listed as `` temporarily unavailable due to background radiation '' at the wormhole stations . Technically not a lie . The Swarm 's drones were mildly radioactive , synthesizing more mundane resources into the unnatural `` foods '' that allowed them to survive the vacuum of space , travel faster than light to new systems , rend our defense ships with atom-thin clawblades , and self-destruct with a fission reaction powerful enough to destroy small planetoids . <newline> <newline> The evacuations had been successful beyond our wildest hopes—almost 50 % of sapients evacuated—but now we had another problem . The Swarm was in range of our core worlds . It was unthinkable , but the hub of galactic civilization itself , the World-City , was at risk . <newline> <newline> But life goes on , at least until it does n't , and we were hosting the Human delegation as a part of the interview process to join the galactic community . There 'd been a lot of hesitance . A lot of sapients joked that they were scarier than the Swarm . A hive mind they could understand , but an unconscious parasitic relationship with microorganisms was just weird . And of what we 'd learned of their culture , they had a lengthy history of not just war but glorification of it . That they entertained their offspring with stories of deadly combat before they were trusted with knowledge of reproduction . Their ability to survive extreme cold and hot without temperature support apparatus was unprecedented . And the way they consumed nutrients was disgusting and barbaric , not to mention the way their historian said they used to obtain them—stalking sentients to the point of exhaustion , then setting them on fire and ripping them apart with their nutrient consumption oriface . <newline> <newline> I disagreed , though . I 'd seen what the Swarm could do firsthand . <newline> <newline> We were giving them a tour of our technological capabilities , finishing up with a tour of our satellite ship manufacturing facility . It was a hail-mary . They were the fourth species we 'd interviewed , with the promise of upliftment to any species who had a strategy for defeating the Swarm . <newline> <newline> The VI in control of the shuttle announced we 'd be using a lightspeed accelerator to cut the time of our journey to just four seconds , and to make sure you were seated or holding onto something in case of inertial dampener lag . After the brief flash , the entire delegation looked shocked—and excited . They huddled around each other . Their leader offered a proposal on the spot . They asked for a spacedock within a light year of the current Swarm location , three of their most powerful lightspeed accelerators , accurate coordinates to the Swarm Queen , wormhole access back to Earth to bring other resources , and as much tungsten as we could spare . Odd , but none seemed out of the ordinary—even youth on the World-City were trusted with lightspeed runabouts . We accepted . <newline> <newline> Three days later , they contacted us to announce they were ready , and just waiting for the leadership council . I was shocked when we arrived—all they 'd done is cut the mass of tungsten in two and sit a lightspeed accelerator to each one . <newline> <newline> Their leader pressed a button . The tungsten mass shot off into space in the blink of an eye . And then ... fire . The part of space the Swarm were traveling through lit up white-hot , as though a supernova had occurred at lightspeed . <newline> <newline> The humans cheered . We cheered . The chair of the council told the Human leader they were proud to offer Humanity probationary access to the World-City , and if they stayed in good standing , after a few centuries , a seat on the junior council . It was a rote speech they 'd given to dozens of new species over their tenure . <newline> <newline> The Human leader paused , as though he were deep in thought , and then bared the sharp spines around his nutrient intake orifice . <newline> <newline> `` I 've got a counter-offer . Humans are given three seats on the senior council , including the Chairmanship . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's outrageous ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Ask me why we asked for three lightspeed accelerators . '' <newline> <newline> He looked confused . `` Why did you ask for three lightspeed accelerators ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Simple , '' he said , pacing across the room , until he was standing in front of the second mass of Tungsten . `` One for the Swarm queen . One to take home , study , reverse-engineer . And one to aim at the World-City in case you did n't like our counteroffer . '' <newline> <newline> The jokes were right . Humans were worse than the Swarm .

0,"We had no choice . <newline> <newline> We were an ancient race . We saw Galaxies form and be consumed , we saw species rise and fall under the weight of their own will to survive , we saw entire universes begin and end ... But we never saw them coming . <newline> <newline> Our species had reached enlightenment eons ago , from then on we traveled the multiverse helping species advance to what we knew to be the enlightenment we achieved . We spent millennial nurturing , protecting and teaching them . Some were accepting , trying to reach the high goals we set for them . Others were insidious , using our eternal knowledge only to further their own agenda . All , unfortunately , perished . Some failing the test of evolution and dying out while others had to be eradicated lest they pose a threat to other species . <newline> <newline> The Kariir were the best and brightest . They learnt , grew , practiced what we preached and we kept giving them more ; information , wealth , they never had enough . Yet somehow , they never attained enlightenment . We should have know . Maybe it was our desperation , finally having a species grow so fast and be so thirsty for knowledge . Perhaps we were too excited after the countless failures that we did n't see the signs . Perhaps they were too cunning even for us . <newline> <newline> As our cities fell by our own knowledge , as our vast system crumbled , we could only watch with horror as malformed versions of our own creations consumed us . It had not been knowledge they looked for , but power . They had not reached enlightenment not because they could n't , but because they did n't want to . As even our eons old strongholds fell and we were pushed back to the single planet of our origination , our council met in desperation . It was agreed . We had no choice . <newline> <newline> A single ship was sent to the quarantine zone . A small solar system surrounded by a field that blocked all communication and all detection , from inside and out , to all eyes except our own . Inside this zone was the most deadly disease we had ever come across . With just bare levels of consciousness , this parasite burrowed into a host planet , sucking it dry faster than any species in know existence . It called itself `` humans '' and upon first sighting had immediately been classified as the most dangerous plague ever to have been discovered over the know multiverse . In the time it took a regular species to develop it 's first language , this species grew into a full fledged civilization , attained near super-light travel and annihilated itself a hundred times over . They were quick to learn , violent and ruthless . Although a ( barely ) sentient species , they were classified as a plague due to the level of damage they could cause to planets should they escape the one they inhabited . With no regard for life , the only thing keeping them in check was the availability of only one planet they could devour . Should they spread , all necessity to keep their planet alive would be gone and entire universes could be lost . <newline> <newline> We had no choice . The ship docked at the planet . <newline> <newline> As with all plagues , less exposure was better . The crew of that ship knew what the signed up for . They were never seen again , doomed to spend the rest of their miserable lives being tested in all manner of horrific ways . From then on , we just nudged the humans in the right direction . We phased all remaining friendly systems with sentient life out of the humans observable reality for what was a mere heartbeat for our species and when we returned , the galaxy that was once full of life , even Kariir life , was gone . An entire universe was but a collection of husks of dead planets floating in a void . We survived . All was good for us . Or so we 'd like to believe . <newline> <newline> But we know , somewhere out there , life is being ended faster than it can begin . Somewhere out there , a species is building it 's first radio transmitter only to be descended upon by a plague . Enslaved , raped , tortured ; their world turned to ash . We had won the war , but lost so many species in the process . <newline> <newline> We tell ourselves we had no choice , but we chose us over them . All of them . We 'd doomed ourselves to a lonely existence , being the only race immune to the disease spreading across the cosmos . <newline> <newline> Humans . <newline> <newline> We had a choice , but we chose us .

Protocol Zestraol , named after a large jawed insect , native to the home planet of the Trepentari Republic , had been on the books for centuries , and hadn ’ t even been mentioned in a formal counsel meeting since its inception . Named for the Zestraol insect , which locked it ’ s oversized mandibles onto it ’ s prey , any time the Zestraol insect bit , it was as likely to decapitate itself as kill it ’ s prey . <newline> <newline> After a few moments , which dragged like hours , hushed murmurs spread like wildfire throughout the command center of the last Trepentari capital ship , more of a mobile bunker now , than a military vehicle . Held within were the genetic records of all creatures native to Trepentar , as well as highly encrypted co-ordinates to a planet similar to it on the edges of the Galactic rim . Each individual felt the weight of their desperate cargo , and each held it in a different way . <newline> <newline> Amongst the murmurs , the thin , spindly arm of the Ambassador to the Federation snaked it ’ s way through the silence , until it was held like a white flag above the heads the consulate , what was left of the Trepantari leadership . The Ambassador ’ s normally calm , confident , and soft spoken voice , carefully cultivated to reflect Trepantari cultural values , nearly broke under his own shock , fear and disgust . <newline> <newline> “ But , Sir , the Federation of Sapient species have classified any technological sharing with , with , the humans , ” the word fell out of his mouth like dead weight , “ as a interplanetary crime , we could face.. ” <newline> <newline> “ Extinction ? ” , hissed the Admiral , acting head of the Trepantari emergency government , from her position at the head of the table . “ We already stare extinction in the eye , The Veythat Conglomerate have deployed nuclear weapons on two of our planets . Another violation of intergalactic law ” . <newline> <newline> She waited for the point to sink in , the only other species known to have deployed Nuclear weapons within relevant intergalactic history had been the humans , the Admiral had chosen this atrocity well , a parallel hung in the air . <newline> <newline> “ We have nothing to fear from the Humans that has not already been offered to us as threat by the Veythat . The only consequence we face , is that a galaxy that has turned a blind eye to our suffering , may also feel the terror , the primordial fear of not just our own death , but the possible death of our species , in the same way that we now know . We stand to gain a possible ally , a rabid Kluaxar perhaps , but our own rabid Kluaxar. ” <newline> <newline> As her words filled the room , a voice tainted with anger , Trepantari dignitaries shifted in their seats . Her passion drew them in , and as she broke with the custom for quite considered political speech , the Admiral coaxed an anger and a passion to the forefront of her fellow counsellors . <newline> <newline> “ The Humans are a cruel , ignoble , and disgusting species . They make war on each other without any thought for peace , and they hoard what resources they have , building great empires on the backs of slaves of their own species . They rape , kill , and torture each other over wealth which they could easily share . At the height of their most progressive empires , stand great oligarchs , who buy and sell humans with no regard . We will unleash a great plague on the galaxy if we do this thing , and even the Veythat will know fear . An adult human is capable , barehanded , of killing at least three Veythat in combat , and they are known to bear litters of up to four children . Their adulthood cycle is one third of ours , and one half of the Veythat . They are known to arm their children as soldiers , and are willing to fight beside them as comrades . They are intelligent and adaptive , within years of the first experimental Sapient Counsel technology drop , they had reached their orbiting moon . They are capable , and they are violent , and the only thing they hate more than themselves , is something which does not resemble them . Even amongst their own species , they are known to kill each other over skin pigmentation . We are fortunate in being bipedal , they will focus on our enemies first. ” <newline> <newline> Heads began to nod , in grim anticipation of the decision that would be made here . The Admiral continued , cultivating the anger and irrationality that can be found when any sapient creature faces oblivion . <newline> <newline> “ If we supply them with technology , we can hold back , we can manipulate their encryption , we can build them an empire with our knowledge at its heart . We can build a symbiosis . They will hate us , but they will hate the others more , they will need us , and like a Klauxar , it is possible we can train them . I will broke no arguments , as emergency head of the emergency council , I exercise my right to call for an silent vote. ” <newline> <newline> As hands raised across the crowded bridge in favor , the Admiral ’ s heart sank at what she knew her duty to be . <newline> <newline> “ It is settled , I volunteer my daughter as ambassador to the humans , the mission will launch in two cycles . I have already made the preparations . ”

0,"A pale , lifeless light illuminated the room I sat in , a bunker of concrete and steel buried beneath their mountains . Their leaders had insisted I wait here , alone , while they deliberated amongst themselves . It was with great sorrow that our people had come here . <newline> <newline> The humans did not know , of course , that we could see their meeting . Far above earth 's atmosphere , our flagship was scrying upon the gathering below . Linked to the Collective , we all shared in the experience of watching . Some with hope ; some with fear . It was technology we had been driven to create after the Kalari attacked us . <newline> <newline> We had lived for millennia in peace , one collective consciousness . The ferocity of the Kalari had shocked us , driven us from world after world . Even now , they were gathering to assault our home world . We had scried upon their war ships , and fled into the dark reaches of space . Now , we had found a species capable of fighting back . And so we watched , as the leaders of humanity decided our fate . <newline> <newline> `` You can not do this , General , '' Ishugiri said , shaking his head . `` What they are asking ... we simply can not . '' <newline> <newline> General Patterson leaned forward , clenching his hands on the table . `` And just why the hell not ? Aliens , on our very doorstep , with faster-than-light travel ! And you want me to turn them down ? '' <newline> <newline> Ishugiri looked to his colleague , Yamoto . The world 's top scientists , they had been among the first called here . <newline> <newline> `` General ... you would be sending us to an endless war . You see , the FTL drive ... it 's all relative . For the soldiers you put on that ship , they will arrive at their destination instantly . But to us , thousands of years will have passed . If you sent a scout to a planet 3,000 light years away , and they came back and reported , it would be 6,000 years later here on Earth . There would be no way to get information back . We would be sending millions of troops to their deaths , year after year , without any way of knowing what has happened to them , '' Yamoto explained . <newline> <newline> `` Even if you were able to assault their homeworld , '' he continued , `` you 'll be sending them with technology that 's thousands of years old when they get there . You would be attacking them with what would amount to sticks and stones , and they would retaliate . This is a war that no one wins . '' <newline> <newline> General Patterson frowned . `` That is where you two are wrong . I 've already had my men run the numbers , and this war will be over in about 1,500 years . We 've seen the data on their reproductive cycles . Even if 100 of our boys die for every one of those cocksucking Kalari bastards , we will prevail . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 'll be sending billions of people to their deaths ! '' Ishugiri exclaimed , aghast . <newline> <newline> The blood drained from Yamoto and Ishugiri 's faces as General Patterson pushed away from the table and stood up . `` You scientist types always forget one thing . History is written by the victors . In a million years , nobody will remember how many people died in this war . Yet my name will be immortal , as the person who brought humanity to the stars and colonized the galaxy . And the only thing we have to do is send some poor wretches from the slums in Africa to go fight . They 'd be dead anyway if they stay here . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' General Patterson said , `` I think we must do this . I 'm taking the deal . We 're going to crush the bones of those Kalari bastards underneath our feet , and history will thank me for it . '' <newline> <newline> *Our race is doomed* , came the thought from the Collective . *We have chosen our executioners* , came another . The minutes stretched like eons as a consensus was reached . *We must proceed . The humans are a young species ; they may evolve past this hatred . We can not say the same of the Kalari . We will leave the humans our memory vaults . One day , they may understand . * <newline> <newline> The door opened , and General Patterson walked into the room where I was being held . <newline> <newline> `` Show me those FTL drives . ''

0,"Steel , Dust , and Plastic . The sight of it enlisted no feelings of urgency , the weight of it proposed no thoughts of danger . It was small , but heavy ; crude , but somehow precise . I was handed the metal device along with a small box of seeds and ushered into the moonlight . As I walked past my comrades and onto the parapets , I was met by the strange creature , no taller than a child . <newline> <newline> When the curtains began to fall onto our civilization , it was decided to call upon a small society of organic machines for assistance . I was neither a soldier nor a scientist . I lived much the same as my fathers , tending to a small space of land on an asteroid colonized millennia ago . But I did have a vague knowledge of the creatures . They were n't far from us and I had heard a few stories from passing traders of their existence . Hopelessly lost in the void and clinging to a small star , the Humans had none of necessary resources for light speed travel . Call it a poor hand of cards , but without reserves of Kellar on their handful of planets , they would never see another home . <newline> <newline> We were content to keep it that way , after all , the population of the galaxy was becoming denser every season . Every cycle I would sow and reap , sow and reap , content to continue the labour of my forefathers . When others joined the asteroid , looking for a new life , I welcomed them . When a handful asked to share my property , I shared . When they needed food , I gave . Soon the small asteroid was awash with races , each looking for their own home . <newline> <newline> As the population grew , so too did the differences between species magnify . Some would hoard their necessities , others would isolate themselves . Food became scarce , but I still gave . When I could no longer give , I sowed others fields . When that was not enough , when I could truly give no more , I believe that is when I began to think . It was likely , at first , I was blind to the tragedies unfolding around me . Indeed I was , until I first witnessed something so strange , it shook me to the core ... Violence . <newline> <newline> Some species began to take by force , merely pushing and threatening their way to safety , shelter , or food . Then , as others began to push back , death erupted . Claws were drawn and sabres were rattled . As sides began to form , I tried only to take no part , I gave to those in need , and so too did my brethren . This violence was never seen on my small space in the galaxy before , but this story was being replayed in every corner . It was not a single race , that would be presumptuous , but many . I only know that for so long , our race was able to draw no blood . We knew nothing of violence , or war , and as the planets began to drown in blood , we took our leave . <newline> <newline> Now we know of war . When the fat , taloned Kami arose from the ashes of our planets , we saw that peace was not coming . Forged from the deaths of all others , the Kami could not see reason . We knew nothing of violence , so we built our walls high , and prayed for salvation . Those prayers reached out to our last ally . They answered . <newline> <newline> After contact was established , stories flowed into our outpost . As we sat around our fires , I was told of their metal automatons , capable of crashing through houses , crawling over trees and leaving only splinters . We hoped they would crush our fat enemies . Their flying machines , loud and brave and screaming death from above . We delighted to think they would carry away our foes . Humans , it was said , were forged in the fire of war . Their isolation brought constant conflict among their worlds . I could never had understood that before , but conflict now seemed to be my only reality . We dreamed of them coming in their millions and restoring peace . Using their great contraptions to bring us back to our farms . We would no longer have to die . <newline> <newline> Disembarking from our ships , in their parchment clothing , the short creatures did not bring with them machines of war . Instead , they carried long boxes , hundreds of them . We were told these would be our salvation . We were spoken to by one of our leaders that once the humans had heard our pleas , they counciled among themselves about our fate . He explained that the councils of earth had determined that their machines would not be necessary , neither would their soldiers . That our fight was our own , and they would provide us with the tools to free ourselves . As the speech ended , disheartened and hopeless , we prepared for war . <newline> <newline> On the moonlit parapet I stood , one of the humans next to me as it gnashed its mouth and gestured with two limbs . I felt clumsy handling this tiny tool , raising it to my face and pulling a lever , and putting it down again . I saw that my comrades , fearful of the coming hordes , were becoming irritated with these useless gestures and pointless tools . That is , until the creature reached down and began to place the seeds into a smaller metal container . Once it was full , it placed it under my steel device and motioned for me to fire . The noise was astounding and the eruption from our outpost was terrifying . In an instant I understood , metal monsters were unnecessary . Indeed , if it were n't for their seeds , Humans would be unnecessary . <newline> <newline>

0,"Captain Hamil stood on the deck of the Wraith at the edge of the Adh'kadhir system , the final piece in our war against the Anorak . They resembled insects , mantises specifically , in appearance but had leathery skin like reptiles with an internal skeleton . They had to you can ’ t have an exoskeleton and be 2.8m tall . They walked on four legs , had two ‘ arms ’ with scythe like appendage and another smaller set of arms with two fingers and a thumb . Their mouths looked almost canine and they were obligate carnivores , surrender was not an option as they would just eat any prisoners they caught . These fuckers were terrifying at close range , Hamil ’ s facial scar and empty eye socket could attest to that . These guys were what nightmares were made of and they certainly haunt mine . We have been at war with them for the past two and a half centuries , brought into this conflict by our long time trading partners , the Clandeks . And now after so many generations of constant combat we were finally getting ready for the final assault on their homeworld , to wipe these motherfucking bastards of the face of the universe . <newline> <newline> “ Commander Rogers , are all of the batteries loaded ? ” Hamil asked his first officer . “ Full spread of antimater planet crackers is ready and waiting , the plasma cannons are online and double checked , point defense lasers are fully operational , and all repairs are complete from the last battle captain , ” replied Rogers . “ Excellent , I want every last one of these little shits erased from the galaxy . Those fucking ‘ ethicists ’ back home can bitch about xenocide all they want , but they have not experienced these asshole up close and personal and I am sure their opinion would change their mind when being hacked up alive for one of their stews. ” ” Aye Aye , ” The bridge crew responded in steely voices . <newline> <newline> Now all Indra Hamil had to do was to await the rest of the flotilla to get in position and Admiral Vanipessa ’ s order and she would finally get to rid herself of this hated enemy once and for all . And then she thought , maybe we would get those devious Clandeks for starting all this . Those fucking pussies kept the technology of FTL travel away from us and essentially stole our most valuable minerals from us while trading us scraps of old technologies . Motherfuckers , they will get what ’ s coming to them but later . They only decided to share what we so wanted after the Anoraks decimated most of their empire , and I can see why . The Clandeks are a ‘ peaceful ’ race that controls most of the hyperspace nodes and lanes in our sector that make FTL travel possible . We could bypass these lanes , but the energy required would drain our sun in a decade . So they exerted control over all of the surrounding species by being able to embargo anyone to oblivion if they don ’ t behave . The Anoraks just happened to discover a back lane on one of their planets that gave them the technology needed to be able to fight the Clandeks . The rest is history , they started wiping these smug shits off the face of the galaxy one planet at a time . The Clandeks are physically unimpressive and match the description of the Roswell aliens from over four centuries ago . They were no match for the Anorak war machine and when their home planet was besieged , they came to us . They finally gave us FTL technology in exchange for defeating the Anoraks . They also ‘ graciously opened the shipping lanes for us to travel through . <newline> <newline> The first battle with the Anoraks was a fucking slaughter , only two ships made it back . Their technology was too much for us , but we learned . The first century of combat was more guerilla tactics , the Anorak had FTL much longer than us and had several planets under their control , they were merely relegated to a small number of systems by the Clandeks . We at the time only had one , but after FTL there were many uncolonized worlds that were left open because almost every other race breeds slower than us . Whereas we have 20 year generations and a baby is possible about once every year or two the Anoraks have 60 year generational times and 4 year gestations , the Clandeks 100 year generations and 10 year gestations and the same for about every other race we have learned about . So our government encouraged a population explosion , in fifty years we had fully colonized ten different star systems . An my god what a boon it was to our technology in both research and stolen tech . So in the end we out fucked our enemy , our population grew so much that after a century , though our technology was still not as good we started winning battles by sheer numbers . And after each conquered planet our population kept growing . As far as we know , we are the most populous species in the galaxy and our tech matches everyone else . So now we have clawed our path to the Anaroks world by world in buckets of our blood and they will pay . And then hopefully those greedy Clandeks and anyone else who thinks they can challenge us . <newline> <newline> “ We just got the attack command , ” Rogers reported . “ Alright ladies and gentlemen , here we go , ” I replies . “ Lt Atwallah keep formation and prepare to make a pass at the planet , I intend there to be nothing left of them. ” “ Of course Ma ’ am , ” responded Jal Atawallah . <newline> <newline> And so the final nail in the Anorak coffin was being hammered . My ship , along with thirty five other antimatter missile frigates , covered by the third fleet will descend on the Anaorak homeworld . Only one of us needed to deliver our payload to remove their planet from existence , but we are not fucking around… <newline>

0,"“ Mr . President , we have recieved confirmation from the other countries . They are all on board. ” <newline> <newline> “ Very well , has the agreement been signed ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes Mr. President. ” <newline> <newline> “ Then let us address the American people in the morning and let them know the truth . May God help us all. ” -- -- -- -- <newline> The major networks were a buzz with excitement . A major announcement from the President of the United States given in the morning hours of the day . This was to coincide with a similar announcement to be given by all of the world 's leaders at the same time . What could possibly be so big that would require this ? <newline> <newline> Ben had only been working with the LA Times for a few months but was eager to get to the field . Having served in the military , he was excited to re-join an infantry unit as an embedded reporter . This would be a monumental step in his career and that of the news organization as well . <newline> <newline> “ Hey Carl ! ” Ben called out to his partner who would be on assignment with him embedded with the Marines . “ Any word on what this announcement is about ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Naw man , they haven ’ t told us anything . Apparently the press at the White House has been kept in the dark as well . Come on , let ’ s go to the media room. ” <newline> <newline> Ben and Carl had served together in the military . They lost contact briefly as they attended separate colleges and found themselves as new hires with the LA Times and were inseparable since . <newline> <newline> The media room was packed and thankfully there were plenty of screens for them to see . Speakers were hooked up to the television so everyone could hear the sound . <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s right Tom , we have unconfirmed reports that this may be a call to peace to the ongoing conflict but again , we have no actual confirmation as to… hold on… . It looks like the President is about to speak… ” <newline> <newline> The screen cut away to the Oval office where the President sat at his desk . He was illuminated perfectly by the lighting and his composure looked as calm as ever as he began . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Good Morning my fellow Americans . I have been informed of some developments that will alter the very course of this nation and all of humanity . As you may know , at this very moment , heads of states across the world are addressing their nations to inform them of this news which we , not as Americans or any other nationality , but as humans must all unite for . <newline> <newline> First , effective immediately , I am officially announcing the end of ALL military operations in Southeast Asia to include Vietnam . All forces will immediately withdraw from any operations and return to their respective bases . Together , with help of Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin , we are declaring a peaceful withdrawal of all forces to include North and South Vietnamese forces . This agreement was signed last night and does include the signatures of Ho Chi Minh and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu . <newline> <newline> We have put our differences aside to end this conflict and march together on the road to peace and unification . <newline> <newline> Secondly , the United Nations & NATO as we know it will no longer exist . Instead we will be forming a new alliance simply known as United Command . United Command will be a collaboration of all of the world ’ s major military powers and will be supported by smaller nation states as well . Simply put , this is a global organization composed of a human alliance working together for a common cause . <newline> <newline> A human alliance . At no other point in the history of mankind have we been challenged and forced to pull all of our resources together like this . My fellow man , it is with an open mind , kind heart , and willful spirit that I bring you this revelation . <newline> <newline> Over the last few weeks we have been in contact with an organization that desperately needs our help . In exchange for that help , they will grant us technologies that we can only dream of . <newline> <newline> Today , I am officially announcing the acknowledgment of life beyond this Earth . We have been contacted and been in communication with a race of extraterrestrial beings who have come to us for help . Yes , this is true and you heard that correctly . Mankind has been contacted by a race from beyond this planet and even this galaxy . They came to us in peace and have requested the assistance of our forces to help their planet in dire need . The details of this operation are still being worked out , but rest assured that our forces will be put to good use in defending the beings of the Andromeda Galaxy as well as us . <newline> <newline> I have directed my staff to call upon all local government officials , media outlets , and emergency response personnel to disseminate details to you as we unite in this new cause . <newline> <newline> Today , we make history . Today we are no longer divided by borders , race , or ideologies . Instead , we are united as humans . As a race of beings who create art , love one another , and show goodwill to all life . <newline> <newline> May God have mercy on man and bless all forms of intelligence. ” <newline> <newline> The media room was silent as the television faded away with the Presidential seal in the background . Not a single word was spoken as the only sound was the slow whirring of electronic devices and people breathing . <newline> <newline> The television cut back to the news reporters who looked just as stunned . Someone turned off the TV before they spoke again . <newline> <newline> The silence was broken by a ringing phone . Soon another and another started . The office became a cacophony of ringing telephones , people talking , and the normal chaos of a busy day at a newspaper . <newline> <newline> Ben & Carl walked out of the media room . <newline> <newline> “ What the fuck man ! What does that even mean ? ” Carl exclaimed to Ben as he pulled out a cigarette . “ Fucken aliens man ! ? Are you shitting me ? ” <newline> <newline> Ben didn ’ t say a word . His mind was just as confused and he didn ’ t fully comprehend what was happening . This morning he was eating cereal thinking about Vietnam and now there is talk about aliens ? <newline> <newline> A woman came up to them running . <newline> <newline> “ Ben… Carl ! ” She stopped to catch her breath . She was clearly shaken and trying to compose herself . “ The chief wants you in his office immediately ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Fucken great , you know what this means Ben…. ” Carl didn ’ t need a reply . They both walked straight to the chiefs office . <newline> <newline> The editor-in-chief was a salty mother fucker . A veteran himself , he knew Ben and Carl were the perfect ones to get embedded with the Marines headed to Hue City . Now their entire lives were going to change . He was hard and got shit done , but he had a heart that cared more about his staff than his own well being . <newline> <newline> The office was brightly lit as the the curtains were wide open letting the light in . <newline> <newline> Ben & Carl closed the door behind them as they stepped into the office . <newline> <newline> “ Gentleman ” The Chief had has back turned as he stood over his collection of scotches and whiskeys . He was pouring three glasses . <newline> <newline> “ I am sure you all heard the news this morning ? ” It was a rhetorical question as he already knew the answer . Still he wanted to confirm as he handed Ben and Carl a glass each . “ Please , have a seat. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yea man , what the fuck does this mean sir ? ” Carl asked as he took a sip of the scotch and sat back on the recliner . <newline> <newline> “ It means you two are not going to Vietnam anymore . You will still be embedded with the Marines though. ” <newline> <newline> “ Sir , Carl and I are just confused . If there is no more Vietnam , what is there ? ” Ben asked as he placed his untouched drink on the table . <newline> <newline> “ Gentleman , in all of my years I have never seen anything like this . In the Pacific we hopped from one God forsaken rock to the other not knowing what to expect . I ’ m guessing this is similar . Except the rocks will be much larger. ” Roger finished his drink in one gulp and began to pour himself another drink . <newline> <newline> “ I just got off the phone with the First Marine Division XO . What I am going to tell you , you must never repeat to anyone else . I was only told a small piece of the puzzle though. ” He drank the second glass in one drink as well . <newline> <newline> “ You will be embedded with an infantry unit that will be leaving this planet and headed out to the Andromeda Galaxy. ” <newline> <newline> Carl stared at Roger in disbelief as he sank further back in his chair . Ben picked up his glass from the table and finished the drink in one gulp as well . They both knew that Roger was not one to bullshit them and what he spoke , as incredible as it sounded , was true . All of it . <newline> <newline> “ Roger , you… . Are you saying that - ” <newline> <newline> “ I am telling you that you are going to become fucken space reporters . The first ever ! Congratulations ! Now the details of this are all highly classified of course . However , time tables have been moved up . You are to pack your gear and report to Camp Pendleton in 72 hours . From there you are to be embedded and report directly to the Commanding Officer . That is all the information I have. ” <newline> <newline> Ben and Carl looked at each other in disbelief . They both knew they couldn ’ t pass this up . Something like this may never come up again , ever . <newline> <newline> “ Gents , make no mistake . This is beyond the comprehension of any one of us . We don ’ t know what we are getting into and it is your responsibility to share this story with , not just Los Angeles or America , but the entire human race . Tomorrow we will sit down for dinner and go over any questions you may have . Right now , you will go home and prepare yourselves for the journey ahead. ” <newline> <newline> With that , Roger stood up and Carl and Ben did as well . <newline> <newline> “ Men , make man proud. ” <newline> <newline> <newline>

0,"The six humans stood in the lobby of the Parliament of the Leaf-Falls-When-Darkened People . Five of them feeling very out of place and dwarfed by the huge pillars surrounding them “ Their language is partially pheromone based ” the first contact ambassador lectured . “ The scents don ’ t translate flawlessly into spoken word. ” He passed the closest a blockish computer with a set of handles on either side . “ This should get the gist across , Ambassadors . If you ’ ll excuse me , the Parliament is waiting ” He nodded deeply , almost a bow , and waved the five towards a towering set of doors on the wall opposite . <newline> <newline> Ambassador Caitlyn Clarkson twisted the handles in her hands . “ Well , best be off , ” she said in crisp , British tones . Striding purposefully towards the board doors . Five sets of shoes rang loudly against stone , echoing in the vast quiet . <newline> <newline> The tallest of them looked over the building quickly as they walked , his eyes followed one of the pillars until it faded into shadows , the ceiling could be 5 feet further or a hundred , no way to know . He whistled appreciatively , “ I wonder how long this place too to make ? ” He wondered aloud , absently thumbing the pin on his lapel , a small metal version of the American flag . <newline> <newline> “ By the way I ‘ ave ‘ eard it , it was build for this very occasion not one week ago. ” The third said , a heavy french accent lilting his words . “ Did you not read the briefing Ant ’ ony ? ” The man with the pin shrugged , accepting the accusation easily . <newline> <newline> “ I was a bit busy , Laurent ” he said , waving vaguely to their surroundings “ This wasn ’ t a small pill to swallow. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes , Yes , very impressive ” the fourth man said with a rough Russian baritone . “ We have decided what we ’ ll bargain for ? ” He glanced at his peers . <newline> <newline> “ The People ’ s Republic would be very interested in the technology used to create such a building so quickly. ” the last said , a dark haired short man piped up . His english came in quick bursts through his accent . His own lapel bore a metal Chinese standard . <newline> <newline> “ With interstellar travel we could expand our borders exponentially , Chen ” Caitlyn said to the Chinese man , “ It is the logical choice. ” <newline> <newline> “ The President wants to acquire means of interstellar travel as well ” Anthony said , looking down from the pillars . <newline> <newline> “ Mine as well ” Chen said , his face calm and unreadable . “ However such technology should not be ignored. ” <newline> <newline> Laurent nodded . “ Then we are agreed ? ” He glanced between the ambassadors . “ Faster than light travel abilities premièrement , and merveilleux building second. ” he tick off the list on his fingers . “ Oui ? ” <newline> <newline> Four of the five nodded in agreement , The Russian simply grunted . Anthony clapped him on the back jovially . “ Come on Viktor ! This is the biggest deal in human history ! He can ’ t want more than that ! ” <newline> <newline> “ KGB does not train well for patience ” the Russian grumbled , his accent giving the impression he chewed gravel regularly . <newline> <newline> “ He will have to deal with it. ” Caitlyn said slowly as she stopped in front of the doors , huge slabs to stone stretched dozens of feet over them . <newline> <newline> She turned to the others , the blocky translator in her hands held in a white knuckle grip . “ Well gents. ” She set her shoulders and smiled her most convincing smile . That smile had stopped three civil wars and convinced at least one militarized dictator to double check he was **sure** he wanted to continue on his course of actions . “ Time to make history. ” <newline> <newline> The doors swung open at a touch , silently sweeping across the Parliamentary Coliseum into a flat oval of stone . Caitlyn was happy that she didn ’ t hear only her own breath catch as her eyes adjusted to the dimness . <newline> <newline> There were hundreds of them ! Huge looming figures clothed in vast robes , sat in seats that ringed the floor , they couldn ’ t be less than twenty feet tall . Caitlyn ’ s eyebrows jolted upwards . They looked surprisingly humanoid , as far as she could tell anyway ; she couldn ’ t see most of their bodies or their feet , but their faces looked almost human . Despite being blue and with a nose larger than her own head , the extra pair of arms was a dead giveaway though . <newline> <newline> One alien stood in the center of the Coliseum , his arms were thin , tiny compared to the rest of him , and all four were spread . Twenty-four fingers splayed in a gesture Caitlyn could only take as peaceful . He loomed over the five , looking both mighty and fragile at the same time <newline> <newline> The five humans continued into the Parliament , striding confidently but their eyes never stopped in one place for long . <newline> <newline> As they approached the alien on the floor bowed slowly , bending gracefully at what should be some kind of waist , its arms still spread out from it ’ s body . Uncertain , Caitlyn replicated the gesture . The other four jerkily followed her . <newline> <newline> The Alien straightened slowly , and it opened its mouth . Caitlyn ’ s heart thrummed as the sound vibrated through her chest ; the sound flexed through the air , growing and shrinking . It washed over the humans like a gentle tsunami , sweeping away everything but that single sonorous note . Caitlyn looked down at the translator ’ s screen uncertainly . <newline> <newline> *Hello . * <newline> <newline> “ Mon dieu ! ” Laurent breathed . “ What did he say ? ” He asked urgently . <newline> <newline> “ He said hello ” Caitlyn said faintly . <newline> <newline> “ Then I would ‘ ate to hear ‘ im argue ” Laurent ’ s grin was uneasy . <newline> <newline> “ lets get this going then , shall we ? ” Anthony tried to speak lightly , but even he seemed shaken by the greeting . <newline> <newline> The next hours were a cacophony of sound . The peal of a massive bell mixed with a drum the size of a house began the story , it was followed by legion of low brass that lamented their losses , and shrieking trumpets emphasized their need for help . A symphony in a mouth , as Caitlyn had began to think of it . She read from the tiny screen as they sounds pounded the air around her . <newline> <newline> *The Leaf-Falls-When-Darkened People are peaceful . Our world was such that violence was unnecessary . When we hungered we ate of the Strong-plant-sweet-plucks , when we thirsted we drank of the Gentle-water-at-length . For many hundreds of centuries we walked in peace under the Strong-plants-that-reach-high , then further still to the Lights-bright-in-the-sky . We accepted the gifts of the universe when we needed them and there was a great peace . The few souls we met did not desire harm on us , so we welcomed them to eat of the fruit and drink of the stream , then they left us . There was peace still . * <newline> <newline> *Then ***they** *came , we offered the fruit , we offered the stream , but these uprooted Strong-plants-that-reach-high the and diverted the Gentle-water-at-length . When we asked them why they steal these gifts , freely given , we were gifted with the first murder in the histories of the Leaf-falls-when-darkened ’ s people . * <newline> <newline> *When we confronted them they only responded with more murder , never before have we needed to defend ourselves in such a manner . We have been driven back step by step , our gifts stripped from our hands . The Leaf falls when it turns dark , when the ices come it does not resist , but soon our entire forest shall be stripped bare , with no new shoots to grow in the new season . A gift requested is no fit gift . But we would have you know of our plight . You , the children of suffering , whose home filled with teeth sharp and rage hot . You can keep our forest green to grow dark in its own time . We ask of this gift , freely given . * <newline> <newline> Caitlyn heart pounded and she raised a hand to massage her forehead , it came down slicked with sweat . The speech had no stops or pauses to get a word in , they could only stand a listen to the barrage and read from the little screen . <newline> <newline> “ боже ” Viktor mumbled , shaking his head . <newline> <newline> Chen agreed in his own language . massaging his temple gently . <newline> <newline> “ Lets leave God out of it , Vik ” Anthony said distractedly , staring wide-eyed between the Alien and the translator . <newline> <newline> Caitlyn shook herself out of her stupor . “ Keep collected boys , we have a job to do. ” she said quietly . She stepped forward , raising her voice and replicating the bow again . “ We thank you for the audience , If you allow , I will confer with my colleagues. ” <newline> <newline> She waited as every blue face dropped to their laps , hidden behind the many benches , presumably to look at translators of their own . A slience stretched , the aliens soundlessly staring down , then with a tiny *paff* a small pink cloud rose and as one the assembled Aliens drew a deep breath through their huge noses . A single great breath echoing over itself so many times over it sounded like a muted hurricane . <newline> <newline> Another moment of silence stretched , Anthony cleared his throat quietly and Caitlyn ’ s low heels clacked softly against the stone floor . <newline> <newline> slowly , like a particularly tired sloth , the assembly nodded . broad lips smiling to reveal teeth the size of chisels . Caitlyn bowed again and turned to the others . <newline> <newline> “ We ’ re not doing it for nothing. ” Viktor grumbled immediately . “ Not a “ gift freely given ” his jaw set stubbornly . <newline> <newline> “ Agreed ” Chen said . “ Not possible ” <newline> <newline> Anthony tapped his lip thoughtfully , “ There are faster ways to get fired , probably ” <newline> <newline> Laurent chuckled quietly . <newline> <newline> “ Agreed , ” Caitlyn nodded and stepped back to the assembly . <newline> <newline> The alien on the floor clasped two of his hands and watched her attentively . “ Now , ” she began , that smile sitting comfortably on her mouth . “ What 's it worth to you ? ” <newline> <newline> ( Ok , I tried , but I ca n't seem to get text to bold inside italics .

0,"Excerpts from : A Comparative History and Context of the Upliftment <newline> <newline> Fong Wuzhou , Ph.D Terran History and Foreign Exo-Policy at U.C . Berkeley , CA , 2299 CE <newline> <newline> While 22nd century humans were capable of many things , superluminal travel had always eluded even the greatest scientists . At this time , the greatest aerospace achievement was the mission Bright Horizons , the first attempt at colonizing an exoplanet a scant 25 light years away . It utilized near cryogenic technology to preserve 500 inhabitants for their 60 year journey to Gliese 581c ( Johnson , 05 ) . The irony of this is that , by the time the colony ship arrived , a separate set of humans had beat them there and prepared for their arrival . This was made possible due to the arrival of the Chaktans , an exospecies hailing from the Perseus arm in 2218 CE . This first encounter , though momentous , was not entirely benign . Imagine that you believe that you live alone , but self sufficiently , in a secluded cabin . In your entire life , you have not seen another person other than those who raised you . You believe you are alone . And while you are scavenging one day , you come across another human , immaculately dressed in silks . She speaks your language and informs you that not only are you not alone , but you are under her rule . This would be quite the shock and it was not lost on humans . <newline> <newline> <newline> At the time of the Upliftment , the Chaktans were ensconced in a brutal interstellar war with a now endangered species known as the Sri'Do , and on the brink of capitulation . This war has several names , to the Chaktans it is known as the Fading Sun War , so named after the weapon of mass destruction implemented against them which caused erratic behavior in stars , often rendering near by planets uninhabitable to most species . Sri'Do historian Ba'lel Makt refers to this war as the Subversion War ( Makt , 50 ) . In it 's controversial , but not unsubstantiated opinion , the Chaktan central goverment attempted to foment rebellion among the Sri'Do planet-states in an effort to acquire stellar territory and damage Sri'Do trade which had come to dominate the region . This trade gave the Sri'Do significant power over neighboring and galactic economies ( Makt , 50 ) . To Humans , it is simply known as the Upliftment War or , more colloquially , as The Price of Admission ( Buhle , 52 ) . <newline> <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> <newline> Chaktan ambassador and defacto leader The Patience came to earth seeking aid ( It is customary in Chaktan culture that great individuals are stripped of their birth and family names and given a Holuryan , a title-name that captures their greatest trait [ Suran , 215 ] ) . The Patience came with gifts of advanced technology , the training to use it , and what she considered the most valuable resource , sponsorship for entry into the Quoro Du Mopta [ Pan-Perseus Guild ] which opens up valuable trading and settling rights throughout the Perseus Arm . It was a grand gift , and one of desperation with very thick strings attached . In exchange for these things , he asked that humans ally with the Chaktan in their conflict ( United States of Terra Exopolicy Document 21 , 19 ) . <newline> The governments of Terra reacted in typical human fashion . Some sought to forge immediate alliances , others wholesale rejected the offer , and others sought to bargain in an effort to gain more . These disagreements quickly turned political , then hostile . Within six months , the first armed conflicts began . Three months later , Terra dissolved into global warfare as many saw the fate of humanity at stake ( Owen and Barkle , 30 ) . Long untapped alliances crafted more than one hundred years prior were called upon and in 2219 , the Unification Wars began and would take two years to resolve . <newline> <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> <newline> In the biography about The Patience , 'Listen , Watch , and Deliberate ' by awarded Chaktan biographer Essileiria Rey , she quotes The Patience on his explanation of his incredibly unpopular move to seek aid from the Humans of Terra , rather than another culture , in a private interview : <newline> <newline> <newline> > '' The [ Humans ] possess an interesting combination of traits that make them ideal allies . Physically they are remarkably indestructible and hardy . Mentally they are capable of extraordinary endurance and operate at a high capacity even while taxed in the extreme . Socially they have resisted all efforts , until recently , of total cultural assimilation . While this may have held them back technologically , the species has produced more art , entertainment and unique social concepts in its history than many other species that have existed for three times as long . I could go on extolling the virtues of [ Humanity ] but that is not the question you asked . I chose the humans because they 're still alive and prosperous . Many call them barbarians , [ psychopathic ] , megalomaniacal and war mongers fueled by fear . And they absolutely are . On a level I find them deeply disgusting and it pains me to forge this alliance with them . More than disgust though , I fear them . They are a predator ever seeking to be apex . The middle child of evolution trying desperately to prove itself . It is imprinted into their [ DNA ] . All other races refused First Contact because they feared their diplomats would be killed and dissected on site . In truth , when I first looked into the brown , circular eyes of a [ Human ] , I knew immediately where I stood in the food chain , and I did not like it . '' <newline> <newline> Author 's note : bracketed words are translated for ease of reading . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> Many humans consider the subsequent fifteen years of galactic warfare necessary , even to this day ( Pew Research , 90 ) ; although hostilities continued for another five years after the official closure of theater in 2245 with the Treaty of Orion . In total the Sri'Do were driven from 57 habitable planets , 248 habitable moons and 78 asteroid belts . Approximately 55 % were kept in conditions well enough to be occupied immediately by Humans or Chaktans , who require very similar atmospheres and temperatures to survive . Of the 45 % left , 15 % were repairable and are still in the process of re-terraforming the planets back from conditions more suitable to the Sri'do ( Galactic Ecological and Settlement Agency , Report 2j8k4d , 99 ) . <newline> <newline> It is common belief that the Sri'do are largely responsible for the destruction of the remaining worlds with their aggressive methane based terraforming and highly pH Basic ecology ( Pew Research , 90 ) . Memoirs , letters home , recovered film , and interviews paint a different picture though . The Sri'Do describe an `` Invincible enemy who 's only separation from the front lines is how long it takes to heal from the previous wound . '' ( Kak'dlak , 55 ) who are `` experts in [ the ability to detect fatal weakness ] and masters of exploitation '' ( Bekt , 56 ) . One Sri'Do commander , fleeing to friendly lines , talks about how the humans , rather than directly assault the line , engaged in a shelling campaign lasting [ two weeks ] , `` They kept dropping shell after shell of cheap explosives in completely random patterns . You could n't [ take a piss ] without splashing the latrine because the ground would shake . No one could sleep . Madness set in quickly . Sri'Do may not need a lot of sleep , but what they do need is vital . Unlike humans , who can stay up for more than three wake/sleep cycles , if a Sri'Do even manages to push past one , they start to lose it . '' ( Trene , 32 ) A nearby civilian describes the following battle , `` Human weapons are loud , even to humans . I think they 're meant to intimidate their enemies . But when they engaged our soldier 's line , there were no enemies , only children , grasping their knees and whispering for relief . The humans brought it , one bullet at a time . '' ( Sarkat'a , 23 ) <newline> <newline> I bring these up , not to slander humans or to tell the horrors of war . Those narratives can be found in many other books and essays across the Perseus and Orion arms . These stories , and more , help to tell as true a narrative as possible about the Upliftment War and Humanity 's subsequent entry into intergalactic politics . While it can be shown with some clarity that the Sri'Do are responsible for continuing the Fading Sun and Upliftment wars , undue guilt has been laid at the feet of the Sri'Do for the destruction of habitable worlds . Humans , with their habits of total war , are responsible for at least part of , if not the majority of , the worlds that are rendered damaged beyond repair . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> The near extinction of the Sri'Do and their diaspora from their home world of Sri'Fala occupies one of the many morally grey areas of warfare and the history of the galaxy . To humans , it is the equivalent of the first nuclear detonations during World War II , or the second nuclear detonations during the Carbon Wars . Chaktans may relate in regards to The Central Civil Wars and the use of asteroids as weapons during the Satellite Rebellions . The Sri'Do are not likely to recover from such an event . The estimated total population of Sri'Do is about one million , spread across over a hundred planets and many more moons . From this , Humans have made a powerful impression on the galactic community . One of caution . One of fear . As they continue to integrate into the politics , businesses and communities of the rest of the galaxy , they face discrimination and ostracization . Humans may be forced to rely solely on the support of other humans , pushing them further to the fringes of society . Xenophobia may set in , and before long , there wo n't be another Upliftment War , it will be a war of supremacy . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> The Patience : `` Some Humans have a story of a female tasked to guard a box that contains all the splendor and terror that life has to offer . However , this female is overcome by curiosity and hubris and opens the box , releasing all things wonderful , never to be captured again , and bringing all things painful to her people . The Humans were our box , they existed in our space . We knew of them , we watched them . And now , we have opened the box and it can not be closed again . I hope that these stories are not the same . '' ( Rey , 50 ) <newline> <newline> Edit : Forgot a citation

0,"I hope I 'm not too late ... This is the first thing I 've ever written . Critiques welcome . <newline> <newline> ======================= <newline> <newline> The High Chancellor of Elsten drew in sharp , ragged breaths as he hid under his desk . His magnificent robes of office were in shambles , he was cut , bruised , and thirsty . It had been four cycles since he 'd last had hydration sustenance . Had it been four ? Maybe it was only three . No , definitely four . It felt like six . <newline> <newline> *Focus . * <newline> <newline> He could n't allow the weakness to take over his mind . He had to be like them ; he had to be strong , use every ounce of strength , every advantage , every opportunity . His conscious begged him to stop , to see reason and try again for civility . <newline> <newline> *No . * <newline> <newline> The ship civility had left orbit long ago when the Outer Planets had fallen to the Haderian scout ships . Scout ships ! What an embarrassment . They did n't even entertain the idea of peace . They 'd murdered the emissaries without even making contact , his nephew among them . Even still , as the colonies fell one by one he 'd pushed for peace . He 'd pushed for reason , and decency , and some way to appease their aggressors . For all of his work ; he 'd met failure , again and again . They 'd forced his hand ... What other choice did he have ? There was no going back now . He 'd acted with parliamentary authority , he knew it was he right thing to do , their only hope ... But it still sent shivers through his bones . <newline> <newline> *Stop it . There 's no point in justifying your decisions to yourself . * <newline> <newline> The temptation must have been too great , he mused , to attack a race that had eliminated crime and war millennia ago . The first citizens to be attacked likely stood in confusion as they were cut to ribbons by phase fire . The Elsten had tried to develop defensive weaponry after the Outer Planets fell , but they simply did n't have the know-how , the experience , the logistics , and more importantly , the skills or will to use them . <newline> <newline> Had he led them down this road through his inaction ? Had he waited too ... <newline> <newline> *Footsteps . * <newline> <newline> Fear arced through him like a lance . He 'd been foolish to let his fatigued mind wander . Now he could hear two Haderian Breachers closing on him . They had incredibly acute hearing , perhaps they 'd heard his labored breathing . With any luck he could ... <newline> <newline> The footsteps passed . <newline> <newline> Chancellor Brax held his breath for another solid minute until he was sure the Breachers were gone . Haderians were humanoid in shape , with longer than average ears and sharp , bird like features . They were quick , intelligent , and ruthless . It was that ruthlessness that had given Brax the inspiration to reach out to the only species more brutal than the Haderians , Humans . <newline> <newline> If the Haderians were a bludgeon of ruthlessness , then the Humans were a wrecking ball . Even that analogy seemed inadequate . Wrecking ball was n't a strong enough term . They 'd first discovered the humans some two hundred years ago . An Elsten scout ship entered the atmosphere and was promptly shot down , confiscated , and the pilots experimented on until they died from the stress of `` medical examination . '' The Elsten Chancellor at the time had declared the Human solar system a restricted zone , and placed the species under observation . <newline> <newline> It was soon discovered that the Humans had scavenged the barebones scout ship that they 'd recovered , and reverse engineered the technology to serve their own purposes . A technological and medical revolution boomed into existence in only a few Human years , and they made primitive space craft within fifteen years . The Elsten Council was shocked further when humans used that technology to wage constant war on themselves for two hundred years . <newline> <newline> The Humans themselves proved to be as rugged and ruthless as their technology . They drank the most corrosive liquid on the planet , were capable of losing up to half of their blood and still fighting , they could lift up to two times their body weight , could run unfathomable distances without stopping , and most notably , they spent considerable time and effort learning what they deemed `` the Art of War . '' War as an Art ... That was what finally sold Brax on contacting the Humans for help . <newline> <newline> Brax had sent his own son to ask for their help . In return , they would offer the Humans the faster than light technology that had made galactic colonization a reality for the Elsten race . He was going to unleash the most brutal species known to exist upon the Galaxy just to save what was left of his race . Some days he felt justified , some days he felt like a monster . <newline> <newline> But it seemed he had waited too long . Not three hours ago a Haderian Cruiser dropped into orbit and began deploying the transport craft that would bring the Breachers to the ground . They 'd sweep through the capital city of Paaren Disen first , and then sweep across the lesser cities on the planet . Even now , they were sweeping through the Capitol building , The Citadel , searching for him . <newline> <newline> His son had been gone for two months , and it seemed painfully apparent that he had failed his mission . It would take a week to jump to the human planet , and it had been eight . Brax was n't sure what stung more , the likely loss of his son to brutal human torture or the loss of his entire race . <newline> <newline> `` Hiding will not save you , Chancellor , '' <newline> <newline> Brax ' heart nearly exploded with fear , as he jumped with surprise and nearly knocked himself unconscious from hitting his head on the desk . Still dazed , the Breacher pulled him out from under the desk by his hair . <newline> <newline> `` On your knees , Elsten . This wo n't take long . '' <newline> <newline> Brax looked up and saw that he had been drug into the main hall . Much to his dismay , the entire government had been placed on their knees in front of six other Haderian Breachers . Brax snorted . Six . That 's all they 'd sent . What an embarrassment . <newline> <newline> He felt himself being pushed to his knees in front of the other Elsten government workers . It seemed he would be first . He briefly wondered if it would hurt , but it seemed like nothing compared to the loss of his son . And his race . Should he think of it in that order ? <newline> <newline> Brax felt the binary sunlight across his face and he raised his chin to look up at it through he skylights . In the blinding Suns he saw a black shape growing larger . Was this death , coming for him after all these years ? More likely his eyes were developing sun spots from stupidly staring at a binary star . <newline> <newline> The shape grew larger still , and Brax focused on it . It was like nothing he 'd ever seen . It looked like an angry black hornet , and the muffled whipping sounds started to reach his ears . It was directly over him when the skylight burst apart , showering hostages and captors alike with shards of sharp glass . The Breachers looked up as ropes descended from the hornet and hovered in the air . <newline> <newline> No , not death . Worse . <newline> <newline> Six humans descended rapidly down the ropes and into the Citadel . Gods they were fast , almost faster than thought . Their boots had barely touched the marble floors before they were upon the Breachers . <newline> <newline> It was beautifully sickening . They seemed to dance among the Breachers as they whipped their thin bars of metal about , the humans themselves looked almost bored as they slashed and sliced their way through what little opposition the Breachers put up . The almost black Haderian blood ran thick as it sprayed and stained the marble floor . And just like that , it was over . In a handful of breaths the humans did what the Elstens had been unable to do since the beginning of the war : they 'd killed a group of Haderian Breachers . <newline> <newline> One of the humans wiped his metal off on one of the dead Breachers robes and surveyed the carnage with an almost disappointed look . <newline> <newline> `` You are Chancellor Brax ? '' The humans voice sounded like grinding rocks . <newline> <newline> Brax could barely speak through his surprise . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , I am Chancellor Brax . '' <newline> <newline> The human nodded and seemed to speak into his shoulder , then he addressed the other Humans . <newline> <newline> `` Sweep the building . Capture if you can , kill them if not . We have ... tests ... to perform . '' <newline> <newline> The men made a fist and pounded their chest , them moved like serpents through the building . The leader turned back towards Brax , and Brax shivered as the implications of his orders sank in , <newline> <newline> `` Your son sent us . We 're here to solve your Haderian problem . '' <newline> <newline> The human smiled a set of pointy teeth at Brax , and Brax managed a smile in return . <newline> <newline> But Chancellor Brax found that it was difficult to force a smile as he begged the Gods forgiveness for the evil he 'd unleashed on the Galaxy . <newline> <newline> Edit : Bad grammar .

0,"-Replay that last segment , if you will , Preceptor Xithis- <newline> <newline> <newline> A thought-command to the mitris-orb and the holographic images reset themselves . The bipedal alien - the 'human ' - sat motionless in front of a vid screen of the most primitive make . In front of it was a rectangular pad covered with buttons , almost all inscribed with strange symbols , no two exactly alike . To the right of this pad was a small oval device on a flat pad . Further to the right was a cylindrical canister covered with colorful pictures and symbols . On its head was a half-circular device covering part of its skull and the sides of its head . Its ears were not visible under that device . I looked inquiringly over at the Chancellor Au'Tereba , noting the signs of agitation around her eyes , the wildly flailing tendrils over her sagittal crest . <newline> <newline> <newline> -Show us again- <newline> <newline> <newline> Another thought-command and the scene replayed . It was one that had shocked me the first time I saw it , but repeated viewings have long since taken their toll on me . I watched in fascination as the scene unravelled . The human placed the middle three digits of its left appendage on a certain combination of symbols on the pad , then rested its smallest digit on another symbol , and its opposable digit on a long , rectangular button which was completely unmarked . Its other appendage grasped the oval device . <newline> <newline> <newline> There was an image on the vid screen in front of the human - a mass of colorful art , symbols and a curious spinning circle in the lower right . The human leaned forward in anticipation . The image shifted to a crude representation of the inside of a building of human make , complete with walls , pillars , corridors and the like . In the middle of the screen was the image of a primitive projectile thrower and a targeting reticle . To the sides of the weapon were images of other humans wearing clothing and clutching those same weapons in their hands . The vid screen exploded with movement as the human somehow caused its image to move within the vid screen . The other humans on the vid screen ran and hopped in every direction until they disappeared from view . <newline> <newline> <newline> -What ... .exactly is happening here , Preceptor ? - <newline> <newline> <newline> -This , Chancellor Au'Ganas , is a human . As far as we can tell , it is engaging in some sort of self-entertainment- <newline> <newline> <newline> -Entertainment ! ? - <newline> <newline> <newline> The human dashed around a corner in its virtual world and was immediately beset by two animals , small and lean with dagger-like feet and gnashing jaws . They crawled on the wall and ceiling and leapt on the human . The Chancellors gasped in anticipation despite the virtual nature of the combat , but what followed was the most astounding gyration of the on-screen image , followed by the furious clacking of keys and the erratic but precisely controlled movement of the oval device . The vid screen spun wildly as the human 's weapon fired burst after burst of projectiles , killing one of the animals , then the weapon switched out to another , smaller weapon and the human finished off his second opponent with several shots from it . <newline> <newline> <newline> A third animal - larger but curiously less threatening , fat and somewhat squat on four pudgy limbs - started running away from the human , but it chased it down some stairs and around a corner , putting shot after shot perfectly into it and also managing to kill it . The hologram continued to play , but my attention was now back on the Chancellors . <newline> <newline> <newline> -Chancellors Au'Tereba , Au'Ganas and Au'Yunis . What we have here is a killing machine of the highest order- <newline> <newline> <newline> I gestured at the hologram at the human , which was still intent on its 'game ' . <newline> <newline> <newline> -It has reflexes and split-second decision making which completely outperforms our battle constructs by orders of magnitude . It is n't even in the same scale , as a matter of fact . It possesses a natural cunning and has an instinct for war and strategy . It knows when to fight , when to retreat , and when to consolidate its position . There , just now . It passed up an obvious target , slipped behind enemy lines and has started to attack the enemy 's supply chain.- <newline> <newline> <newline> -That is inconceivable . How can anything do that ? - Chancellor Au'Ganas stared at the hologram at a new round of action on the human 's vid screen . <newline> <newline> <newline> -It appears to be computing its strategy based on input from its team mates , observing extra metadata in the form of an overlay image - the so-called 'map ' - and the current danger level of its environment . Observe , it appears to be talking into the wand in front of its mouth . My scientists have theorized that it is conveying battlefield information in that manner- <newline> <newline> <newline> The human paused to grasp the cylindrical canister and take a drink from it . <newline> <newline> <newline> -It appears to be self-medicating in order to boost its reflexes and stamina- <newline> <newline> <newline> -This is terrifying.- <newline> <newline> <newline> I looked over at Chancellor Au'Tereba and fixed her with the gaze from my fifth eye , averting the other four out of respect . <newline> <newline> <newline> -I understand how you must feel . I felt the same way too . But we no longer have a choice . Four fifths of our worlds have fallen to the forces of the Adversary . Our people stand on the brink of extinction unless we befriend and enlist the aid of these humans.- <newline> <newline> <newline> -But we have so little time ! Our cities burn , our people perish , and you pin the hope of our species on this- wailed Chancellor Au'Ganas . <newline> <newline> <newline> -ENOUGH ! - Chancellor Au'Tereba projected with such force that we were thrown back in our seats . -We have no further alternatives . Tell us your plan , Preceptor.- <newline> <newline> ============== <newline> <newline> Gabe Newell sat back in his chair , clutching his hair in disbelief , shaking his head side to side . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Holy shit . HOLY . SHIT . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> He picked up the phone , dialed a number . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` It 's me . Listen up . 3 . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> Gabe slammed the phone down and slumped back in his chair . <newline> <newline> ============== <newline> <newline> The mechanized armies of the Human-Antarii Alliance raged over the surface of the Adversary Core World . Its fortresses had long since been overrun , its war machines reduced to scrap and recycled into raw material for the humans to process into more droids . The docks which used to churn out terrifying starships were in ruins . They had been the first to fall in the final invasion of the Core World , the last phase in the battle plan laid out by the Human Emperor . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was all so simple . <newline> <newline> <newline> The technology had always been there . The replicator facilities were already in place . The war constructs of the Antarii were born out of desperation and naivety . They were massive , took too long to produce , and their programming could not account for every situation on the battlefield . A peaceful race for as long as they could remember , the Antarii concept of war had been forced upon them by the Adversary . <newline> <newline> <newline> Not so the humans . <newline> <newline> <newline> Although completely physically outmatched on the battlefield by Adversary war machines , troops and other weapon constructs , their incredible thirst for conflict could be channelled by a simple program into mechanical bodies , effectively fighting by proxy . And the humans even found it pleasurable and exciting . The Human Emperor had even found a way to keep the war , in his own words , 'fresh and interesting ' . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was all so horrifying . <newline> <newline> <newline> Preceptor Xithis stood on the command deck of his starship and gazed at the fiery wasteland far below him , projected up to him via hologram . 'Scorched earth ' , the humans called it , their peculiar tendency to raze the ground and burn every last thing into cinders in order to ensure victory . A squad of drone warriors charged across the battlefield , dodging everything thrown at them with precise , calculated yet erratic movements . They leapt onto the Adversary troops and started to slaughter them , and Xithis had to turn away even from this . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Preceptor Xithis . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> He looked down at his control panel . A hologram image had appeared of a large , rotund human male , with brown hair on his head and strange transparent goggles around his eyes . <newline> <newline> <newline> -Emperor . How may I assist in ending this war ? - <newline> <newline> <newline> `` It is time for the DLC phase . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> -Dee ... Ell ... See ?

0,"`` High General Kalo'son , '' the High Elder 's hirsute and armored attache greeted him with a bow , and a dipped arm , a sign of respect for the Harkorian Grand Commander , `` High Elder G'fanlon is awaiting you in the Citadel with the council . '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son nodded , he had doffed the battered battle armor , but his over-repaired under-armor and battle clothes were his only coverings . Times were tough for the Harkorian Empire , and with their war against Calbolnians who were denigrated with the comparison to kanabs , a hard-shelled crustacean that were bottom feeders in the oceans . <newline> The insult though was that these Kanabs had been disabusing the Harkorian 's for near two centuries now of their territories and the might of Harkorian 's military prowess . The Empire was crumbling , and solar systems had began to `` surrender '' to the Calbolnians . <newline> <newline> Kalo'son laid his satchel on the marred table that also served as a secretarial and security desk . Apparently a few cowards in Parliament had taken it upon themselves to end the war by assassinating the High Elder . <newline> <newline> But , like all wars , things changed . Kalo'son waited at the elevator that would take him down to the chambers of council . His thoughts drifted to when the war first started . <newline> <newline> Yes , we kind of did start this one . The elevator door slid open , and he stepped in with the Attache . And we did kind of allowed our conceit to push the Calbolnians into a corner ... seriously , we blatantly grabbed three systems they had founded , and were developing . Korafora , or in the Calbolnian 's harsh language , `` Bhaklak '' is ... um , was a beautiful ocean and island world . He would never go back there . Ever . <newline> <newline> He bowed his head as the memory of what he witnessed blasted back to his mind . It 's war , he told himself , and shit like this happens in war so do n't think about it . Just do n't think about it . For the love of the gods , just do n't think about it . <newline> <newline> Letting out a strong exhale which drew the attention of the Attache , Kalo'son nodded with a weak smile , and returned his attention to the door . <newline> <newline> The elevator stopped , and Attache took the lead and that is when he noticed that the Attache was packing one of the Terran 's Powered .50x75 pistols . He 'd seen what those things did to the Calbolnians , what it did to their armor , and to whatever was left after it penetrated . Swallowing hard , he flexed his shoulders , and followed . The memories were inching back again . <newline> <newline> The Attache opened a finely chiseled wood door of a pastoral woodland with Harkorian 's lounging around trees , and lakes . For some reason he stopped to take in that scene . It looked like a dream , one of which a person of faith would hope to see again even though they know they never would . Kalo'son knew inside there would never be a peace like that for him . He had seen to much . <newline> <newline> `` Ah , High General , I 'm so glad to see you ! '' The High Elder arose from his seat , as did the council members whom all seemed to be in much higher spirits than they did a few years ago . The High Elder came to him , and clapped him on his shoulder , enraging a sore spot from the last battle . <newline> <newline> `` High Elder . '' Kalo'son bowed as he greeted his brother , and friend . `` And of course , Council . '' Again he bowed . <newline> <newline> `` So , '' began G'falon , '' We have won the war ! This is great news for us ! '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son looked at his brother , then at the council , `` I think you 've over estimated our contribution to their victory , brother . '' Kalo'son ignored his brother 's frown , and moved to the wet bar where he helped himself to a Black Water Kep , straight , no ice . Tipping the crystal glass , the soft tink of the rim hitting his canines was the only other sound in the room . Even the drink ca n't wash away these damnable memories . <newline> <newline> `` Not at all , '' G'falon looked at the frowning faces of the council as he approached his brother . `` you should have been in on the council conference when that prima-donna King B'tikak beg me , he begged me to accept his surrender right then and there ... ah , brother , it is a good day ! '' <newline> <newline> `` The Terrans , brother ... '' But G'falon waved that off . <newline> <newline> `` We 'll have them back on their back water system in no time . '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son barked a sharp , disdainful laugh . `` you have no idea what we 've unleashed , do you ? '' <newline> <newline> Setting the glass down on the counter , Kalo'son stepped around his brother to look at the council . That Terran commander was right , we do look like their dogs ... what did he call those things , their pets , yes , pets . <newline> <newline> `` You sent me to the Terran 's to help us unfuck our fuck-up . '' His arm swinging wide now , his memories flooding back in . `` You told me to give them Faster than Light Travel so they could do our bidding , and fight the Calbolnians . A war we started . I want that to sink in . We started this war , not the Kanab 's , us , we here in this room . We pushed for war , and the fucking Kanab 's took us up on our offer , and beat us ... like 'dogs . ' '' Frowns from the council members and his brother told him that they were not familiar with that particular Terran word . <newline> <newline> `` But we won . '' His brother said with determination , with several of the Council members barking their agreement . <newline> <newline> Kalo'son shook his head , these dolts just do n't get it . `` No , no 'we ' did n't win a damn thing , the Terrans won . '' His eyes lost their focus as he watched the Terrans infantry , millions of them after their victory on Korafora , starving from the lack of supplies began eating those poor Kanabs dead and soon to be dead . What was that word they kept saying , `` batter ? '' No , `` butter ? '' Yes , butter , all they talked about was how much better the kanabs would be with butter . He could hear the shells being cracked open , the sounds of sucking and slurping as their innards were being devoured . By the gods , what have we done ? <newline> <newline> `` But we are Harkorians , this is our Empire ! '' The Council started nodding vigorously as G'falon slammed his palm on the counter , and then pointing at Kalo'son , he snarled , `` And you will thank the Terran 's for their service to our Empire , have them surrender any ships with our FTL engines , and then put them all back into their system . And if they have a problem with that , then we 'll put them down like we did the Pallagins . '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son levelly looked at his brother and then at the council , the rage he should be feeling did not explode as he thought it would , `` As you wish , Brother . I will deliver your message . '' He could n't tell his brother what he had seen at Korafora because then he would have to tell him what he saw at Falkomon , a decimated Harkorian city . There , the Terrans were also eating the dead , and dying but this time it was the Harkorians who filled their bellies , and in some cases , their own kind . It was a never-ending nightmare that would only find peace when he went was sent to his long sleep . <newline> <newline> He would deliver the message , turning to the Attache as they walked out of the chambers , `` You might want to leave the Citadel ... and soon . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why ? '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son thought for a moment , `` because I 'm going to go kick a giant , and if we 're lucky he 'll squash us like a bug . '' <newline> <newline> `` and if we 're unlucky ? '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son stepped into the elevator and pressed the up button to the ground level , as the door was closing he replied , `` he 'll slap us down , and eat us alive . ''

0,"( [ Here ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2qgc5v/wp_a_peaceful_alien_race_is_besieged_by_another/cn66kq3 ) is my story from a very similar prompt . This will be told from the antagonist 's perspective ) <newline> <newline> `` Matriarch , '' The Aresian lieutenant began , `` The remainder of the Libran fleet are in defensive formation within their closest moon 's orbit . There is also a single ship of unknown design , roughly the size of our dreadnaught , outside that moon 's orbit between us and the planet . '' <newline> <newline> The ship was very plain , a large cylinder with the ring of a warp drive around the middle . No markings or decoration of any kind on the hull . <newline> <newline> `` Ma'am , '' The lieutenant continued , `` We are being hailed . Audio only . '' <newline> <newline> `` Surely to announce their surrender . Put them on ! '' the matriarch ordered . <newline> <newline> A small hiss of static swept through the command deck before an artificial voice sounded , `` This is Axiom Alpha number 311312 of the Aresian Extermination Fleet . Surrender now and we guarantee the preservation of your mind state vectors . '' <newline> <newline> `` They must be joking , '' the matriarch exclaimed , `` put me through . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're on . '' the lieutenant said . <newline> <newline> `` Axiom Alpha , this is Matriarch Klaxxis of the Aresian Empire . Our glorious war against the Librans is nearing its end , and you have the gall to demand OUR surrender ! '' she shouted , more as a statement than a question . <newline> <newline> Axiom Alpha responded , `` Please reconsider . Our predictions indicate a 75 to 90 % death toll for your forces . Please allow us to take your mind states into custody , nobody has to die today . '' <newline> <newline> The matriarch 's fury exploded and screamed her order , even over the open comms , `` Lieutenant , destroy that ship ! '' <newline> <newline> The lieutenant relayed the order to the gunners , and the main gun on the Dreadnaught fired upon the plain cylinder . The shot collided with the other ship 's hull , passing through completely . The ship did not explode , but the damage seemed significant . <newline> <newline> The command deck burst into cheering at the demonstration of their might . <newline> <newline> `` Understood . May whatever gods you believe in have mercy on us all . '' Axiom Alpha responded over the open channel . <newline> <newline> `` Ma'am ! '' The lieutenant exclaimed , `` They 're launching missiles ! '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? ! '' The matriarch , skittered over to the lieutenant 's console , `` How many ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Umm , at least two thousand . '' <newline> <newline> One might have heard a pin drop . Two thousand missiles ... There were only a hundred ships in their victory fleet . `` Matriarch to fleet , defensive fire ! '' <newline> <newline> As the missiles approached , each ship in the fleet activated anti-missile defenses and attempted to shoot down the approaching horde . It was n't until the cloud of missiles neared the defensive fields of fire , that the Aresians noticed something wrong . The cloud of missiles turned , and avoided the obvious defensive fire . Single missiles would separate from the cloud and dart in , provoking multiple shots before darting back out of range . Occasionally , a group of five would make an attempt at approaching a single ship . Most of the time the defensive fire took them out , but at least twice , the missiles broke through , and collided with the ships . <newline> <newline> `` Destroy them ! '' The matriarch screamed . <newline> <newline> `` Our large guns are ineffective , they keep weaving between the fields of fire , and the main guns wo n't hit something that small . '' <newline> <newline> The matriarch looked back towards the screens , some realization dawning on her , `` They 're not missiles , they 're drones . The main ship is still controlling them . Destroy it ! '' <newline> <newline> No sooner was the order given than the main guns turned back towards the drone carrier and opened fire . Heavy impacts broke through the hull , tearing the ship into pieces . But the drones still swarmed , with no change to the swarm 's tactics . <newline> <newline> Frustrated , the matriarch continued ordering for countermeasures . ECM proved ineffective as the ships seemed to be using short range communication and relaying orders around . Grouping the ships closer to share defensive missile fire also proved ineffective . <newline> <newline> After a few minutes , several of the fleets ships went from drone impacts . `` What happened ? ! '' The matriarch shouted . <newline> <newline> `` I ... I do n't know ... They were firing their defensive spread , then groups of the drones darted in and hit home . '' <newline> <newline> `` What is going on ? ! '' The matriarch 's frustrations compounded on one another . <newline> <newline> `` Ma'am , '' The lieutenant began , `` Several ships are reporting the drones are darting in during gaps from reloading the defensive guns . '' <newline> <newline> A horrible thought occurred to the matriarch at this time , `` They 're learning ? ! '' There was no greater feat for a military commander to learn and understand their foe , especially during the heat of battle . These were mere machines though , no living thing could withstand the accelerations the drones were displaying . How could they learn ? <newline> <newline> Dozens more ships exploded across the fleet as the swarm became more and more effective at timing their attacks . Ships were starting to run out of defensive ammunition , and fell easily to the swarm . After fifty ships had been destroyed , the swarm had lost a mere two hundred drones . <newline> <newline> With a frustrated growl , the Matriarch ordered , `` All ships , withdraw ! '' <newline> <newline> The swarm reacted immediately as the fleet attempted to withdraw . Several more ships were destroyed by their darting attacks , where the rest of the swarm circled the fleet , spreading out but keeping several drones in the path of each ship . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't care how many of those drones you must crush beneath our hull , engage warp and get us out of here ! '' <newline> <newline> The dreadnaught lurched forward as the warp engaged . Impacts with the drones could be felt on the hull as the dreadnaught simply pushed through . Of the 100 ships in the victory fleet , only 38 remained . <newline> <newline> The problems for the fleet did not end at their crushing defeat however . System failures across the fleet started occuring hours after they engaged warp . Ships were found to have their hulls and superstructures dissolving into grey goo . Engines overloaded , destroying ship and crew alike . The crew of the dreadnaught found themselves cutting away massive sections of the superstructure to remove the contagion . <newline> <newline> Only six ships arrived at their retreat point two days later , only to find their forward base completely annihilated . The blue star of the system was gone , replaced by a stream of super-hot plasma streching several hundred million kilometers away from the orbital plane . Planet orbits were already disrupted , being flung into interstellar space . No military signals could be found . <newline> <newline> The fleet continued on , heading straight for the Aresian homeworld . It would be a long trek , twelve days at full speed , but they would arrive in time for the defense of the system . <newline> <newline> Over those twelve days , two more ships were lost due to engine failures . The matriarch could not help but remember what Axiom Alpha had said . 90 % death rate . <newline> <newline> What greeted the victory fleet on arrival at the Aresian homeworld filled the matriarch with despair . The planet had been bombarded , and huge swaths of the grey goo smeared across the continents and oceans of her world . Completely visible from space . In orbit around each planet in the system was a drone swarm , several thousand times larger than the one they fought on the Libran 's doorstep . <newline> <newline> Several hundred thousand left orbit to intercept the battered fleet . <newline> <newline> `` Ma'am , '' the lieutenant began , `` We 're being hailed . '' <newline> <newline> The matriarch , thoroughly defeated , told the lieutenant to put them through . <newline> <newline> `` This is Axiom Alpha number 214490 , requesting the immediate surrender of the Aresian Victory fleet . You have our word your mind states shall be preserved . '' <newline> <newline> A long silence pervaded the command deck until the matriarch responded , `` We Surrender . ''

0,"War ... war never changes ... until you invite the Terrans . <newline> <newline> At first , I was reticent . Even though I had used my position on the high directorate to 'guide ' the high command 's opinion . It did n't take much , a simple nudge here , a whispered word there ; soon enough , my subordinates had garnered the support of the majority of both the high directorate and high command 's staff . With a heavy heart , both the directorate and command agreed that we would attempt to wrangle the humans into assisting us in our war . <newline> <newline> It all began simple enough , we bumped into them nearly by accident - while both surveying the worlds surrounding H-9957-B6 , what the humans call Alpha Centauri A . The first contact went as awkwardly as one might expect . The captain of the Dau'Nithai'Ien being awakened by his first lieutenant and told that they were receiving a communique . <newline> <newline> By all reports , it took the ship 's AI over six hours to translate all five of the languages in which it was sent . All five languages seemed gutteral and harsh to us . The emphasis seemed to be place on the first transmission , however , a language known as English . Our engineers and geneticist immediately began working on instantaneous translation solutions . Of course , as usual , the engineers won out with something they called the 'babelfish ' . Apparently , the name had been stolen from a text made available on a crude repository computer made available by the Terran . At this point , with my personal babelfish fit into my neural receptacle , I was sent aboard the fastest ship in our fleet . By now , it was no small secret that I had suggested this plan . As such , I was eventually ordered by the head of the directorate to reach an understanding . Boy , if only he had understood exactly what that would entail ... <newline> <newline> Upon my arrival to Alpha Centauri A , the very nervous and perturbed captain of the Dau'Nithai'Ien practically cried with joy . After a little prodding , he began to explain that his entire crew were four weeks deep into a binge session on what the Terrans called 'TV ' . He continued explaining that , his crew had begun using vernacular picked up in TV . Pretend 'gun fights ' broke out during time meant to be reserved for quiet contemplation . Crewman and under officer alike were reciting lines from films such as 'Dirty Harry ' , 'The Good , The Bad and The Ugly ' , 'The Godfather ' and by the captains words , an `` utterly deplorable '' film called 'Clueless ' . According to his lieutenant , the Captain was `` like , totally over this whole humanity thing '' . <newline> <newline> I remember remarking to myself , `` Just what have we found ? '' . <newline> <newline> Boarding the small escape craft , I recall telling my son , who had accompanied me , `` If I do n't come back , let your mother know I love her '' . The flight over to their craft was the longest 10 minutes of my 763 year long life . Through my semicent as a child , to my bicent - two hundred human years served in the military , to my 513 years as high ambassador to the trade coalition , I have never been more terrified in my entire life . The fate of our race , nay , the galaxy lie in the yet unknown goodwill of a race we had met little more than five weeks ago . <newline> <newline> As we pulled to the ship , the pilot began playing clips from American TV shows to communicate . It started with , `` why howdy partner '' , followed by , `` we come in peace '' . Finally , after receiving what I now know is a human laugh , their ship 's captain replied , `` welcome aboard '' . Just then , the cargo doors to their ship swung open and our ship was pulled in via a crude system of 'lead lines ' - attached to our ship via magnets . <newline> <newline> After testing to confirm their air was hospitable , the captain popped the hatch and wished me luck . With a hopeful heart and a dreadful sigh , I stepped out into the dimly lit flight deck . With sweet smelling air , and a bitter chill , the humans seemed very similar to our race . It took me a moment to reach the floor and then it hit me - the Terran were giants ! With hindsight , our average height would measure to be roughly 3 human feet . Their average was nearly double ! <newline> <newline> Summoning my courage , I called out , `` Greetings , I am Ambassador Xallar of the Dau . I have come to speak with Captain Smith '' . That is when the shortest among them , with weak features and a thin frame stepped forward , `` Greetings , Xallar of the Dau . I am Veronica Smith of the planet Earth . On behalf of humanity , I salute you '' . She snapped a firm salute and relaxed , a small smile spreading across her face . `` Wo n't you accompany me to the conference room , Ambassador Xallar ? `` , she asked politely . <newline> <newline> After more pleasantries and small talk , we arrived at the crux of the discussion . With a resigned sigh , I broached the subject . <newline> <newline> `` Captain Smith , with all sincerity and respect I have a monumental request of you . Our people are currently besieged and flagging against a mighty foe , the Valgar . They would most be likened to what I understand you know as an ant . However , they are roughly so tall - '' , raising my hand to about four human feet , I continued , `` We are of course in dire need . Thus , I have been authorized to offer you access to one of the most coveted technologies of any space faring race '' . She leaned forward intently , jaw working as if speaking . I took a long swallow of what the humans called 'tea ' , savoring the flavor ... `` We are prepared to offer you specifications and completed models of our faster than light travel mechanism - FTL '' . <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir , I understand . One moment , please '' . She swiped at the air in a circular motion and swung her arm toward the wall . A projection of a much older , stately male with a darker complexion than Captain Smith appeared . `` Let me get this straight , Ambassador . You are offering us the holy grail of space travel for our assistance in an inter-galactic war ? `` , the man blew out a large cloud of smoke and extinguished his cigar . <newline> <newline> Motioning for an aide , two small counters appeared at the bottom of the screen . The word 'yay ' written in green next to one , and the word 'nay ' in red , next to the other . As humans would say , it felt like watching paint dry . Apparently , somewhere on earth , a debate was being had between the UEC - or , United Earth Congress . The man who I had just spoken to was its reigning president , Arnold Bellamy . All of this in itself was a small mircale , given the fact that , the last democratic planet was wiped out nearly one full millennium ago due to indecisiveness about this very same subject : war . But , these humans were different - they practiced something called `` Republican Democracy '' ; they elected representatives instead of voting on issues directly . <newline> <newline> After three hours , during which time I was fed and given a 'datapad ' to browse Earth media , The President reappeared on the screen . Suddenly , the counters flickered to life and the votes were there on the screen : 1,396 yay - 204 nay . My breathing quickened as I glanced up at the President . He glanced down at me , the edges of his mouth drawn up in a small smile . `` Ambassador Xallar , on behalf of Earth , we accept your call and it is our hope that not only will we be victorious ... but , that this will be the first step toward a long and sustained friendship '' . <newline> <newline> ( ( -- End Part One -- ) ) <newline> <newline> I have to think of where I want to go with this , if there 's enough interest I will write more . Thanks for reading . <newline> <newline>

0,"The atmosphere in the makeshift auditorium could only be described as disheartened , women and children could be heard wailing and crying for lost loved ones in the hallway . <newline> <newline> We had managed to escape the death squads just moments ago , men and women of our race being forced to fight in suicidal charges or lest their families be executed , but as we had come to learn , their families have already been long since dead . <newline> <newline> The Xeyrk showed no mercy when they betrayed our armistice , we had been at relative peace for 10 years , many suspected the Xeyrk were using this time to find way 's to negotiate a way around our hyper lanes , to attack our homeland at the center of all it 's glory , scoffed and shouted down by the opposition , the arrogant declared it impossible ... until today . <newline> <newline> The Xeyrk a confederacy of warmongering races that had built a federation roughly 1,000 years ago in response to the intergalactic communities sanctions against said races , united they have driven this galaxy into chaos , initially the galactic community tried to isolate the new federation , but without the military capabilities to enforce such a blockade against the Xeyrk Confederacies superior military might , it has been a war for survival , many have lost hope of ever winning this war . <newline> <newline> Our hope was reignited 11 years ago , when a young admiral named Tu'Val Banrizan valiantly fought and destroyed our systems last hyperlane generator , but even than , it did n't take long for dread to permittee through our society , this was n't an end , just a death sentence extended . <newline> <newline> As many had feared the Xeyrk had been building a new FTL generator , one that did not rely on standard hyperlane mechanics and could be used to jump to any system within 300 light years . <newline> <newline> It was a normal morning on Promonian , our homeworld , green skies for as far as the eye could see , I was on my way to the 843rd committee meeting to discuss the possibilities of a new innovative technology that could interdict any subspace travel and possibly fling our enemies courses out into the emptiness of space . <newline> <newline> A promising invention that could very well save my people from assured destruction and genocide , unlike the Xeyrk , my people long since forgotten the barbarity and deprived uselessness of war and violence , we sold our swords for quills and paper , instead reaching for the stars and expanding our knowledge and horizons of a better universe , we were a galactic superpower , a federation builder , we ended wars with our words , fought for noble reasons , killed for noble reasons , overtime evolution changed our biology , we no longer had the muscle or even physiological desire to inflict pain and suffering on another , even a non-specie from another race . <newline> <newline> When we first encountered the Xyrek , we sent a diplomatic envoy to open communications , what we found was a humanoid race of Arthropoid 's who had thousands of nation states on their planet , fighting and committing genocide , but unlike my species , these Xyrek developed backwards , they emerged from the ground as collective entities with a hivemind , every action they took was an action all took . They had no individuality and therefore never fought or killed , however , after a cataclysmic event now known as 'Starburst ' roughly 170,000 years ago , the large communities of Xyrek were separated , evolution took hold and the hivemind was broken . Thousands of independent Queens and colonies now fighting for control over the Arid wasteland of what they call `` Tandi '' . <newline> <newline> Over the centuries our diplomatic envoys were met with violence and terror , our ambassadors gutted and tortured for FTL technology , the Xyrek wanted to spread , like a cancer , immediately the newly founded Stellarlonian Federation led by my race the Gonfuryans instituted a sector wide quarantine over the planet Tandi , not a ship or species was to interact with the Xyrek , they were to be completely cut off from the void , unfortunately Tandi is a mineral rich planet and over time the Xyrek found their way into prominence after successfully buying their way into the hyperlane web 's . <newline> <newline> `` Excuse me sir ? '' my young assistant startled me from my recollection , quickly I replied <newline> <newline> `` Yes Tulian ? What is it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The committe 's emergency meeting is now underway , you 've been requested to quickly attend . '' she said <newline> <newline> `` Me ? I 'm just an ordinary merchant , I 'm not a politician . '' <newline> <newline> `` Many of the politicians died in this mornings battle for the Civil Arts auditorium . They 're requesting all prominent figures in our society to attend , quickly it 's about to begin . '' <newline> <newline> Just as my mind began to race to what solution the committee might find , three committee guards forced their way through the crowd and secured my assistant and I and escorted us to the center of the auditorium where there was a stage , and chairs were beginning to be placed , all around I saw beaten and bloody politicians , their dress ripped and torn , many with bruises and broken limbs . It was a sad sight , this is what 's left of our civilizations leaders . <newline> <newline> As if by noticing my worried glances , my assistant gave my hand a small squeeze and sent me a reassuring smile . It did little to stop the swirling I felt in my stomach . <newline> <newline> What felt like an eternity came to an end with an abrupt scream from the hallway , I saw committee guards rushing into the hallways , there was shouting and gunfire , women and children trying to fight past the guards to get into the auditorium , a rush of people , far too many to support in such a small room charged in , many bleeding from what looked like freash wounds . <newline> <newline> My worst fears came to light , the Xyrek have broken through our defense and were overrunning the hallways , the end was drawing near . <newline> <newline> As if awoken from this the committee speaker was rushed on stage quickly . I noticed technicians fidgeting with her mic and setting up the video projection . <newline> <newline> `` People of Promonian , shelter and protected from the Xyrek onslaught for 10 years has left us arrogant and weak ! As we speak 500,000 bloodthirsty warriors are pillaging our homeland , murdering our families and enslaving many into suicide squads and forcing our brave men and women to fight and kill their brothers and sisters ! <newline> <newline> As of now I am declaring total unrestricted war against this menace , no option is left off the table ! I 3rd Committee speaker for this cycle suggest we implore the help of case study # 50047-A effective immediately ! Our very lives are at stake ! '' <newline> <newline> Shouts and screams are released ! Many polticos stand up and protest screaming bloody murder ! <newline> <newline> `` WE CAN NOT ! For thousands of years humanity has been left uninterrupted since the prime directive of # 433 ! Releasing the beasts is a bigger cancer than Xyrek ! They will not stop once the confederacies worlds are destroyed ! They will take EVERYTHING ! '' <newline> <newline> The roar grows louder and louder ! The blasts of energy and explosions in the hallway begin to dim , hopefully indicative of a victory or possibly a bad omen . <newline> <newline> With a loud bam the committee speaker slams her fist into the podium , as fast as the roar raged it quickly extinguished , all were patiently waiting . <newline> <newline> `` Our very existence is at stake ! Let the galaxy burn ! Our worlds will be safe , our fathers and mothers , our brothers and sisters will be safe ! Let us cross that bridge when it comes ! But today ! We must fight for our very right to exist ! '' <newline> <newline> The descending opinions and yells were shouted down by the majority , the committee speaker has swayed the politicos . <newline> <newline> Let the fires spread ! <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> EDIT : This was my first submission to writingprompt and I 've never wrote anything this long , so I 'm very much so an amateur , any criticism is welcome and I hope someone can help me perfect my writing !

0,"“ Greetings , Archchancellor Verdriss . My name is Elizabeth Drake . I am the negotiator assigned to the Korlis Collective . On behalf of the Human race , I thank you for contacting us today. ” <newline> <newline> “ You speak our language ! ” the Archchancellor exclaimed in surprise . <newline> <newline> The woman on the screen smiled politely . “ Each negotiator is assigned to a particular species . I am assigned to yours . To perform my role I am expected to do more than learn your language : I must also study your history , art , literature , and current events. ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ ve been watching us ? ” he asked , frowning slightly . <newline> <newline> “ We may not possess the technology to *travel* faster than light , ” the negotiator reminded him , “ but we have been receiving your broadcasts for some time . It is our hope that by studying potential allies , we might be in a better position to deal with them should they choose to contact us . It is , after all , very difficult to negotiate with someone whom you don ’ t understand. ” <newline> <newline> A nearby explosion shook the building , causing the Archchancellor to flinch . “ If what you say is true , ” he said hurriedly , “ then you already know why I ’ ve called. ” <newline> <newline> The Human negotiator nodded . “ The Korlis Collective is currently engaged in a conflict with the Ber-Sha . A conflict which you have been losing. ” She turned her head briefly , consulting a display that Verdiss couldn ’ t see . “ According to our latest reports , you have lost control of all outer planets in your system . A contingent of Ber-Sha warships now surrounds your homeworld of Isstek , where your capital city is being bombarded. ” She looked back to the Archchancellor . “ Is that an accurate summary of your current situation ? ” <newline> <newline> Verdiss winced , looking down at the table for a moment . “ Yes , ” he admitted , unwilling to meet her gaze . Then , raising his eyes reluctantly : “ Can you help us ? ” <newline> <newline> The negotiator smiled . “ Of course , ” she said . Again , her focus moved off-screen . Verdiss saw her hands typing busily as she read aloud , “ As we speak , three hundred Human warships are stationed at the coordinates I am sending you now . They have spent the last six months practicing maneuvers based on our analysis of the Ber-Sha ’ s military strategies . We are confident that we can defeat them . All you have to do is open a warp gate , and we should arrive at Isstek within minutes. ” <newline> <newline> The Archchancellor saw his console light up as the coordinates were received . He breathed a sigh of relief . “ My people would be eternally in your debt , Miss Drake. ” Then , drawing himself up , he asked the question he had been dreading . “ What price would you ask for your assistance ? ” <newline> <newline> She turned back to the screen , looking him directly in the eyes . “ We want a warp key. ” <newline> <newline> Verdiss shook his head . “ No , I can ’ t . Please… anything else and we will gladly pay it. ” <newline> <newline> The negotiator was silent for a time , eyeing him coolly . She licked her lips . “ On Earth , ” she said eventually , “ we tell stories about a fictional creature known as a genie . The genie is described as immensely powerful—able to grant you any wish you might desire . But it is trapped inside a simple lamp , unable to free itself. ” She spread her hands palm-up , as if proffering all of humanity for his inspection . “ We are a planet full of genies , Archchancellor . But without faster-than-light travel , we are prisoners in the vastness of space . Help us . Open the warp gate. ” <newline> <newline> “ I *can ’ t* , ” he protested . “ There are rules . Your species has been declared too dangerous for now . If we give you a warp key , the council will— “ <newline> <newline> The negotiator ’ s voice turned cold . “ We are aware of the sanctions against us , ” she said . “ You called *us* , Archchancellor . You knew what our price would be. ” <newline> <newline> It was the Archchancellor ’ s turn for silence . Another explosion struck nearby , causing the screen to flicker with static . <newline> <newline> “ You don ’ t have much time , Archchancellor , ” said the negotiator . “ Your fleet is in ruins . Your people are dying . The longer you wait , the less of your planet you will be able to salvage . You can worry about the council when the Ber-Sha are defeated . For now… Open . The gate. ” <newline> <newline> Verdiss looked out his window at the city he loved . Pillars of smoke rose from once-beautiful buildings , now turned to flaming ruin . Over the low rumble of the Ber-Sha ’ s bombardment , he could hear the sirens of the emergency crews . <newline> <newline> To hell with the council , he thought . <newline> <newline> “ Fine , ” he whispered . He typed a short command into his console , specifying the coordinates he ’ d been given . After a few seconds , a red light appeared on the panel . “ The gate is open . Save my people , Miss Drake . You will have your warp key. ” <newline> <newline> “ Excellent ! ” declared the Human woman . “ Our ships are entering the warp gate now . We expect complete victory within three of your solar days , with only fifty-percent losses. ” <newline> <newline> Verdiss gasped . “ Fifty percent ? ! ” he asked in shock . “ I ... I had no idea ! I thought with the size of your fleet , perhaps… ” he trailed off , imagining the loss of life that he had just agreed to . “ You would give so much , just to save Isstek ? ” <newline> <newline> The negotiator smiled again . There was no warmth in it . “ You misunderstand , Archchancellor . Our agreement was the warp technology in exchange for your safety , and the safety of your planet . To accomplish this , we will be destroying the whole Ber-Sha fleet . We will eliminate the ships that are currently bombarding your planet , and then we will use the warp key to hunt down and destroy the rest . All of them . Everywhere. ” <newline> <newline> The Archchancellor blanched . “ That isn ’ t what we asked for , ” he protested . “ The majority of the Ber-Sha ’ s forces are stationed around their homeworld . Once the contingent attacking Isstek is defeated , they ’ ll open negotiations and we can— ” <newline> <newline> She cut him off . “ They are the enemy , Archcancellor , ” she said , as calmly as if she were reminding him that water is wet . “ Trust us on this . In exchange for FTL technology , we have agreed to attack a powerful species . It is in our best interest—and yours—to ensure that anyone watching this interaction appreciates just how seriously we take our agreements . I guarantee you , it will be some time before anyone works up the courage to threaten your homeworld again. ” <newline> <newline> Verdriss slumped back in his chair . On his console , green lights had already begun to appear . They blinked into existence by the dozens , quickly filling his display . The sounds of bombardment ceased abruptly as the Ber-Sha desperately swung about , attempting to target the incoming Human fleet . <newline> <newline> He looked up from the display , swallowing a sudden lump in his throat . “ Miss Drake , ” he said hoarsely , “ in those stories you mentioned… do they ever explain why the genies were imprisoned in the first place ? ” <newline> <newline> The negotiator 's lips quirked with the smallest hint of a smirk . “ It was a pleasure doing business with you , Archchancellor , '' she said . `` Our people will be there to collect the warp key shortly. ” <newline> <newline> In the skies above , three hundred warships opened fire . <newline>

0,"Foreward : Been playing Stellaris a lot lately , so this was a fun write . Used a couple races I made in that as inspiration . It 's been a busy day , so I 've had to write sporadically . Hopefully I was still able to make something readable . <newline> <newline> # Wolves # <newline> <newline> Admiral Jenner scratched at the arm of his command chair compulsively , studying the movements of the people below him . The bridge of the U.T.S . *Salamis* reminded him of what the NASA control center had looked like five years ago , in form if not feature . The rows of monitors and equipment were the same , spread with efficient uniformity before him in the softly lit forum . But all of it had been advanced by a century at the least , courtesy of mankinds ' new patrons , the Echysian Polity . Holographic projections , data feeds , and tactical assessment kept operators in a constant state of motion and information analysis . In place of a wall monitor , a view screen took up the entire north wall , floor to ceiling , giving the admiral and his crew a clear and vivid picture of a foreign star system . Otalp , the Echysian representative assigned to the *Salamis* , stood at Jenner 's side , staring quite literally into space . This seemed to be an odd mannerism of the Echysians ; they often stared straight ahead , expressionless , as if they were in a constant state of consideration . Even so , Jenner got the sense that his compatriots mind was absent . <newline> <newline> `` Something wrong ? '' <newline> <newline> Otalp glanced down at the admiral from his revery . `` What 's the longest you 've been away from home , commander ? '' He asked , his voice tinted with a strange cooing intonation . <newline> <newline> Jenner shrugged . `` Well , I did a tour in the Second Korean War . I was gone ... I guess , five years altogether . I went on leave though , went back for visits . This assignment is probably the longest consecutive time I 've been away . '' In fact , he 'd been commanding the Salamis for nearly two years now , spending most of that time on board in space . He noticed then the fresh rivets he was scratching into the pristine sheen of his arm chair , and tucked his hand by his side . <newline> <newline> Otalp stared off into the view screen again , his eyes running over the barren , blue surface of a minor planetoid . `` I boarded the *J'Val* over a decade ago as part of the Seventh Defense Fleet , right before the Blockade . My last view of home was out of a port view screen as we warped out of the system , away from the Appaq . It looked ... so beautiful ... I still remember the atmosphere 's shade of blue , the reflection from the suns . That was eleven years ago . I 'm not even sure I have a home there anymore . '' <newline> <newline> Jenner studied the strange being , his stoic features tinged with sympathy . He turned back to the view screen and answered softly `` Somethings are universal . Greed , aggression , war . I think ... I think we always hoped it would be different , out here . '' <newline> <newline> `` 'Fundamentally , all life remains as it was . Its aspects simply become greater , or smaller . ' Setarcos the Seeker . '' <newline> <newline> `` What 's the first thing you 're going to do when you get home , Otalp ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Find my family . '' He responded immediately . <newline> <newline> Jenner nodded . `` Of course . '' <newline> <newline> `` What about you ? '' <newline> <newline> The admiral was silent for a moment . <newline> <newline> `` I really miss the smell of lilacs . '' <newline> <newline> `` Lilacs ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's a kind of flower , lovely aromatic . I had a garden of them right next to my porch . On a cool summer evening , the smell would waft right up and tickle your nose . '' He gave a small smile . `` I can almost taste the sweet tea now . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sweet tea ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Hmph . '' Jenner replied , readjusting his focus as a metallic spire came into view around the horizon of the blue planetoid . <newline> <newline> `` Hiris V shipyard coming on view screen , admiral . '' An ensign reported redundantly . Scaffolding extended out into space along a complex structure of metal extensions built around the kilometers tall spire . Hundreds of hulls and exposed skeletal structures could be seen hanging among the scaffolding , like metal insects caught in a spiders ' web . The Hiris V shipyards were a challenging target for the fleet . A forward base of operations , its destruction would cripple enemy supply lines in this sector . Jenner was more than a little hesitant at attacking a target like this , especially with the fleet operating on experimental tactics . But he was more confidant that they needed a challenge ; the validity of these experimental tactics had to be proved in a true crucible . Around the edges of the shipyard in a ring formation came the Fifty-Sixth Appaq Lance . The sharply angled vessels looked devilish in the light of the K-class star . Jenner began firing off commands , leaning forward in his command chair . <newline> <newline> `` Comms , signal the fleet , battle order 104 , engage on my signal . Helm , takes us in towards the capital ship , comms make sure the corvettes keep the fighters off our backs , we 're gon na have a hard enough time as it is . Brace for contact in t-minus 17 seconds . '' <newline> <newline> The opposing fleets began to ungulate like a swarm of agitated bees . Fighters little bigger than terrestrial jets orbited the massive cruisers , as the two alien trained their guns on one another . While the enemy feet was still several hundred meters away , Jenner called out `` Fire at will , battle protocol 104 ! '' . The human/Echysian ships lit up like a bank of fire works , pre-firing into the hostile mass . Few of the shots hit , but it allowed them to quickly adjust their shot into the enemy inertia . Energy beams followed soon coming from the Appaq ships . The energy weapons were built to carve up allied armor , but the humans modified kinetic weapons easily penetrated Appaq shielding , which energy weapons would have been ineffective against in any case . Still , the dichotomy meant that the human ships had to strike a crippling blow within the first few minutes , or be forced to fall back ; and if an Appaq ship was able to strike the first blow , more likely than not it was the human ship that went down . <newline> <newline> The view screen of the *Salamis* could see little of the battle raging around them . It 's electric eye was focused firmly on the Appaq capital ship , a massive vessel with a crew compliment of over a thousand . Compared to the graceful , aerodynamic design of the smaller ships that surrounded it , it was a bulky behemoth , designed to take a beating as it carried the highest ranking officers in a fleet . <newline> <newline> Jenner stared the ship down from his seat , rocking as an energy blast glanced off the *Salamis* 's hull . <newline> <newline> `` Engaging the capital ship sir . '' An ensign reported , swiping furiously though holographic displays . <newline> <newline> `` Target the shield array , we need a clear shot for the missile pay load . '' <newline> <newline> Energy discharges slammed into the hull , ripping open holes into open space . The bridge shook violently with each hit , the room vibrating with the report of recoil guns returning fire . A bridge console overloaded , exploding in a shower of white hot sparks . Fire containment crews rushed in while console officers pulled away their dead and wounded . <newline> <newline> `` Scans report generator down , sir ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Missile bay , activate Greek Fire , target the thinnest layer of armor , on my mark ... fire ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

0,"`` From what we are able to understand , '' the Chief Scientist began , `` their many differences from ourselves , and , indeed , nearly all intelligent life in this galaxy , stem from the fact that they are alone . As a species , they have no means of telepathic communication . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hold on . '' interjected one of the Senators . `` You mean to tell me they ca n't even communicate ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , no . They communicate just fine . They use spoken words , like we do , and they write , just like us . They just ca n't Commune . '' <newline> <newline> The Senate Committee on Extra-Terrestrial Affairs was silent for a moment , as the gravity of this revelation sank in . After what seemed like ages , one Senator managed to inquire , `` So how do they ... how do they *handle* that ... ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Poorly , '' the Chief scientist lamented . `` Though , I suppose as well as could be expected of something like that . It makes them aggressive , to be sure . Always concerned with what is `` yours '' or `` mine , '' and so rarely with what is `` ours . '' '' <newline> <newline> `` The thought of it , just the sheer isolation of ... '' a Senator trailed off , as a hush once again fell across the room . <newline> <newline> It was the Chief Scientist who finally spoke . <newline> <newline> `` This , of course , is what interests us . It is why we need them . Their capacity for war is unmatched . Even our current Enemy will cower before such rage . This isolation , the loneliness , the greed , has bred what may be the most destructive force we may ever see . From what we 've been able to piece together , they have been practicing war more than ninety percent of the time . '' <newline> <newline> `` But what do you mean ? Ninety percent ? And practicing ? On whom ? '' <newline> <newline> `` From the earliest of their written records , to the current time , a span of roughly 3400 years can be studied , with varying degrees of accuracy . They have not been at war for only 238 of those years . '' <newline> <newline> `` But they are Uncontacted , so who do they make their war upon ? '' <newline> <newline> `` On themselves . Their own species . It is true they have not made contact with any other worlds . They ca n't . They ca n't Commune at all , let alone across the reaches of space . They ravage their own world , and kill their own kind . And all with a ferocity we can barely comprehend . Even the Enemy does not do this , knowing that their survival is most easily assured mutually . These beings are merciless , and hateful , and think only of blood and torment . It pervades every facet of their culture . Their entertainment is violent . Their reproduction is violent . Their work is violent . They revel in blood and pain in nearly every moment of every day . The Enemy will find no safe haven from such a thing . '' <newline> <newline> `` But neither would we ! '' several Senators replied at once . <newline> <newline> `` On the contrary , they can be bought . The only thing that seems to assuage their wrath , is their greed . They value gold much more than life , and will kill who we pay them to . Among themselves , they mostly make war for books , or for hydrocarbons , but gold will suffice . '' <newline> <newline> `` War for books ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh yes , there are many of those . There seem to be three books at the moment . The oldest book , the middle book , and the newest book . The three factions have been making war in one form or another for as long as they have been able to write the books . '' <newline> <newline> `` And for hydrocarbons ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Ah , yes , it powers most of their current war machines , you see . Each tribe of these people vies for the few remaining deposits of natural hydrocarbons left on their planet . Without the hydrocarbons , they could not make war , and without the war , they would lose control of the hydrocarbons . '' <newline> <newline> `` Their war is powered by hydrocarbon technology ? '' balked a Senator . `` They are no threat to the Enemy ! '' <newline> <newline> `` While most of their warfare is powered by simple chemical reactions , they have learned to split the atom , and have weaponized the result . '' <newline> <newline> `` Weaponized ! ? They weaponized the Fabric of Creation ? Surely such a thing must be condemned ! '' demanded the Senate Leader . <newline> <newline> `` Perhaps . But the enemy has no recourse for such destruction . I was told to find a species that could stop them . I have . I found one both willing , and able , should we grant them FTL . '' <newline> <newline> `` How ... '' began one Senator weakly , `` How have they weaponized the atom , exactly ? What does this mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` They have constructed portable devices which split a small quantity of atoms within an implosion , and use the resulting explosion in their warfare . They have even begun fusing the smallest atoms , and have weaponized this reaction , as well . '' <newline> <newline> `` For warfare ? How is such a thing used in war ? We have known how to split atoms and fuse atoms for many millenia , but never for war , never for destruction . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , that is correct . But these creatures , in their wrath , have used these devices to split atoms on their own world many times . In their own atmosphere . They kill and maim and corrupt their own kind , by rending the Fabric of Reality , in service of their wrath . Our most reliable count is over 2,000 devices that have been either used in war , or simply tested on their own planet , with another 17,000 still unused . '' <newline> <newline> `` Madness ! Madness ! I 'll not stand for it ! This Senate was founded for the Protection and Prosperity of the Galaxy , not such destruction as this ! To use these devices , and on themselves , is incomprehensible to me ! '' the Senate Leader shrieked . <newline> <newline> `` But what say you to the people of Ventaq ? '' the Chief Scientist staunchly replied . <newline> <newline> The Senate again fell silent . Each member persent paused to reflect on the phrase . Ventaq was the first world to fall to the Enemy . Overrun in mere days , the people died screaming , their suffering echoing through the Communion across the galaxy . All to feed the Enemy . `` What say you to the people of Ventaq '' became the rallying cry against all those who would stand against war , against retribution . `` Never another '' was the call to arms . <newline> <newline> The Chief Scientist began quietly , `` We can see the end of the Enemy . We can see the survival not only of our children , but all children of the Galaxy . This we can guarantee . All we must do , is welcome the Humans among us , and pay them to fight . And fight they will . '' <newline> <newline> `` In Communion , cast your votes . '' the Senate Leader declared . After a brief moment , he continued , `` Then let it be done . We call to the Humans for aid , to destroy the Enemy . ''

0,"Planet 736 <newline> <newline> The hall was hushed as the General drummed lightly on his chair , set high above the two scientists who knelt before him . The vastness of space set out behind him , on a giant screen that allowed them to see outside as clear as glass . He looked down upon the two and spoke , his voice echoing with his age and his rough reputation . <newline> <newline> “ Alright . Present the pros and cons -- this decision may change the course of the universe as we know it , and it can not be made lightly. ” <newline> <newline> They both nodded and the first one stepped forward , papers in hand . <newline> <newline> “ Sir , we propose that in light of the recent Grantuodo attacks , which have left many of the outer rim planets devastated , and shown us that we are , in fact , vastly outgunned and outnumbered , to enlist the aid of one of our old Allies , the species of planet 736. ” <newline> <newline> The General raised his eyebrow . He knew the proposition ; he had already reviewed the papers , but still , to hear the suggestion out loud was startling . <newline> <newline> “ We believe that the denizens of planet 736 have the viable resources , understanding of war , and the sheer dedicated force of numbers to resoundingly crush this threat , as well as send a strong message to the other empires that the republic is not to be trifled with . Without them , we stand to face a costly war that our analysts say will leave this nation of worlds vulnerable to attack , costs millions of lives , decimate our infrastructure , and that is only if we win . The Empire of Grantuodo is well armed and well trained , and while the republic is unified under peaceful arrangements and trade routes , we simply don ’ t have the fire power to fight back . We must call on the aid of planet 736 , and release <newline> the shield which keeps them trapped in their galaxy. ” <newline> <newline> The general nodded softly , and the first scientist stepped back , while the second one stepped forward . <newline> <newline> “ General , my comrade speaks the truth . We are in dire straits , and these are uncertain times . However , we can not allow fear to trick us into making the worst mistake in thousands of years . To release planet 736 would be a greater mistake then treaty of Aquas and Ignas . The people of planet 736 are violent , unstable , disturbed creatures whose lust for war and destruction knows no bounds . Certainly , they have performed great acts of courage , art , and are probably the fastest growing sentient species in the known universe , but the founders of the republic saw fit to lock them away in their home galaxy for a reason . They ’ re dangerous , and calling for their aid could mean the destruction of not just our enemies , but of our allies and ourselves as well . We ’ re better off losing the ground we have gained in fighting the empire than to lose everything by calling on the help of 736 . I beseech you sir , to reconsider the options . We mustn ’ t allow fear to blind us to the simple truth . 736 is dangerous and they will turn on us after our foes our defeated. ” <newline> <newline> The first scientist spoke again . <newline> <newline> “ 736 is violent yes , but that ’ s what makes the perfect for the job . My comrade may call them unstable , but their children grow up engaged in play combat , they engage in near constant psychic and mental warfare with themselves from a young age that give them an immunity to most conventional kinds of psychological warfare . Any specific sub-race deemed too weak is summarily destroyed or absorbed into the greater whole . They even come in a variety of colors , sizes , and mentalities to allow for faster adaptation , and even camouflage . Yet , despite all of this self-conflict , they engage in some of the most tender acts of kindness towards their own kind and others as often as they display brutality. ” <newline> <newline> The second scientist interrupted , his voice harsh and cold . <newline> <newline> “ You say they show kindness , yet our research has yet to even prove if they have the capacity for altruism . In fact , many of our top researchers suggest that they only act in ways that will bring about the best result for them as an individual or a whole , and that means sometimes showing kindness. ” <newline> <newline> “ This is true sir , but whether they are a kind race or not is not up for debate . What is important is their use in this war . Planet 736 , despite having fallen under multiple attacks from various races , had fought off every single one . They are undefeated when given a purpose to fight behind . They reproduce too quickly , adapt to fast , and invent weapons with such a startling speed that no other race has been able to handle their constant change and flux . Even their morals , mannerisms and techniques change with an unrivaled speed , making them suited for any situation. ” <newline> <newline> “ And that ’ s exactly the problem sir . They change , and fast . They are like a virus that changes its encoding to attack , we may set it upon our enemies but there is no guarantee that they will keep their focus on them once they are destroyed . They could very easily turn on us… they have no memory for the past , only for current debts . They owe us now , but once their debt to us is paid what will stop them from turning us ? In a few generations they will surpass anyone who attempts to resist them , it ’ s their very survival mechanism. ” <newline> <newline> For a moment he paused and shuddered in revulsion . <newline> <newline> “ For pity ’ s sake , they slaughter other species on their own planet in the millions for their food ! Some of them even find it pleasurable to mutilate the skin of other species and then wear it for as part of tribal decoration ! There is even a small sub-sect of pain worshippers who inflect horrible pain upon themselves for reproductive gratification . And even further , they have some that their own race fear and tremble before , that even disgust them . Generally , instead of rehabilitation as is standard per galactic code , or banishment , they are… Executed ! They are far too brutal to be trusted. ” <newline> <newline> “ General , you must also take into account that at the time , their race was rather primitive , they have since created synthetic fabrics that most prefer to wear as decoration . Though… they still consider slaughtering non-sentients as an essential part of their food source , but they can not be blamed for evolutionary patterns of ancestors. ” <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s beside the point ! General , Look at their religion ! The primary religion of their planet is based off of the idea that when their god came to earth preaching about peace , they killed him . Even in the name of this supposed peace religion they kill and maim each other . They irradiated their own atmosphere ! They are loose cannons , a bomb with a randomized timer , completely , irrevocably insane ! ” <newline> <newline> The general looked at the two who had fallen into bickering , all sentiments of a civilized debate gone . He looked closely at them , and he did what he was most known for , most valued for . He read the situation . <newline>

0,"“ WOOOHOO ! OFF WE GO ! ” The ring of quantum-networked assault pods shifted as Jeykob pulled his command ship into a dizzying spiral . <newline> <newline> “ Hive Leader Jeykob , must you show such signs of bloodlust over the command network ? While I can appreciate your enthusiasm , it disconcerts us herbivores. ” <newline> <newline> “ Sorry Two , but this is what we 've worked for for more than a century ! It 's hard not to be excited . Especially with the sheer power we 're carrying . It 's a rush ! ” <newline> <newline> Hive Leader Two-Eight-Seven-Three ( its name unpronounceable by the human diaphragm ) made its equivalent of a sigh . It was true , their species had cooperated in scientific and tactical research for more than a century , leading to the development of dark matter generators powerful enough to allow frequent wormhole generation . Humans , the hardier species of the two , had jumped at the opportunity to study even civilian wormhole generators , and had within a decade improved the basic models beyond even Two 's race 's prototypes . Within two decades , humans had begun developing tactics incorporating wormhole technology . Within three , the perpetually-capable dark matter generators only humanity had been insane enough to develop had been compacted into small boxes . The speed of technological development humans were capable of stunned the rest of the galaxy , and reminded them of why humanity had been quarantined in the first place . <newline> <newline> A century later , and the combined Imperial Earth-N'kzriizi fleet had made its maiden wormhole jump between galaxies , ready to test itself against the most coldly terrifying military force in the known universe . Humanity 's old Von Neumann probes . <newline> <newline> More than a millennium of war had taught the Von Neumann Cloud the strategies employed by the entire galactic community , and it consolidated its entire mass in a system-sized fleet of calculated destruction . Most of the races the Cloud encountered had been obliterated and converted to fuel and scrap material for the Cloud 's matter furnaces . <newline> <newline> Co-Admiral One of First Formation stretched its wings as it prepared to address the massed forces of Earth and N'kzrii . “ < cough > I expect you are more than capable of knowing our enemy . They were not programmed with self-improvement algorithms , though the original control signals are corrupted beyond recognition by even our human analysts . Be ready for anything , and do n't expect the wormholes to provide a significant advantage . We jump in three minutes , Earth Standard . Good hunting. ” <newline> <newline> The holorecorder turned off , and One let out a shudder . The very concept of hunting was terrifying to his species , which , like the rest of herbivorous civilization ( another oddity of humanity : the first space-faring race of non-herbivores ) , preferred to think of battle as a competition rather than a hunt . It had startled the humans , who had believed no civilization capable of interplanetary , let alone intergalactic travel would still think in the outmoded ways of *fairness* or *honor* . <newline> <newline> “ 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... LET 'S GO ! ” Jeykob allowed himself to shout once more over the command network , switching half of his assault pods into attack mode , the rest to independent wormhole maneuvering in order to better protect his command ship . The pods , shaped like shields with large gun barrels ( really directed dark energy emitters , capable of rupturing most metamaterials and reducing all known alloys into their component sub-atomic particles ) , cycled their secondary dark matter generators in near-anticipation of the battle . <newline> <newline> The fleet erupted into the center of the Von Neumann Cloud , guns blazing with beams of pure darkness tearing through the ancient probes . It was a slaughter , or would be if any organic life forms had been injured . Another human invention , infinitely ablative and absorptive metamaterials , had rendered both command pods and shields invulnerable . The Von Neumann Cloud adapted quickly , trying to jam communications with both visually stunning laser noise blasts and incredible EM radiation , but the quantum networks never used the electromagnetic spectrum , and were unaffected . Command ships , 4500 in all , seemed to teleport constantly , confusing the Cloud 's targeting sensors into searching for a permanent source indicative of a counter-intelligence ship . <newline> <newline> The Cloud had found its single permanent signal : the lone N'kzriizi ship present , a new-generation flagship and carrier which projected a skin of tightly controlled antimatter as protection against both energy and mass . When chemical lasers on a planetary scale failed to destroy the single unblinking signal on the Cloud 's sensor web , the laser broke down and shifted into an accelerator cannon . When a projectile fired at 1.7 c ( humanity had broken the speed of light millennia ago , a necessity of colonizing the Milky Way ) ceased to exist inches short of impact , the Cloud shut down . It had finally accomplished its goal . Humanity had arrived to colonize the universe , despite the strange devices meant to prevent extra-galactic colonization . Only humanity would be capable of this level of ingenuity , according to the Cloud 's observational engines . <newline> <newline> Co-Admiral Jonsin turned and gave One a very purposefully toothy grin . “ It appears we have succeeded , Co-Admiral . Humanity has broken its cage , proved its worth to the intergalactic community , and gained just a little bit of technological know-how in the process. ” One 's coloration shifted uncontrollably to the human equivalent of nausea . “ Cage , Co-Admiral Jonsin ? ” “ Well sure , you do n't mean to say you had forgotten about the destructive field around the Milky Way that the intergalactic community powered down around a century ago , do you ? The one that allowed contact between the most fearsome species native to your galaxy and the only species of ours ? ” “ You ... knew ? I had been under the impression that it was not only classified information , but that you had also not been born at the time. ” One was visibly trying to keep its fear gland , and instinct to flee in check . “ Of course we knew , One , we simply did n't feel threatened . If the N'kzriizi feared us enough to quarantine our galaxy during our era of generation ship travel , we knew we had nothing to fear , and likely not very much to gain . We were wrong , of course , but there 's no harm done in waiting on our Von Neumann machines to be our ticket out , peacefully to all observers. ” “ What do you intend to do now ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , since everything has gone just as planned , I imagine our terrarium ships will arrive any second now . We 'll join the intergalactic community , selling our wares and living our lives . And researching . Because the only thing better at keeping the peace than a really big stick is something better than a stick. ” <newline> <newline> `` Why tell us ? '' `` Because we 're already out of containment , and you ca n't possibly re-quarantine the most advanced race in the universe . What can you do ? '' <newline>

0,"There is no nitrogen in space . There is nothing else either , except for the occasional hydrogen atom : no light , no pressure , only a void so cold and dark and vacant that the Sirian body can not last three seconds before death . But for all its cruelty , space is only an environment ; its deadliness can be circumvented with the life-support systems that we have been using for millenia to send our ships into its cold embrace . Space will not try to kill you , and you are never made the target of its lethality . <newline> <newline> The Procyans were different . Malicious , brutal , and cunning , they had slaughtered hundreds of millions , intent on the extermination of our people . Their star was dying , mere centuries away from boiling their oceans as it expanded into a red giant . We offered them a colony on one of the gaseous planets , but they had slaughtered its inhabitants and taken the base before we even received their one-word answer of `` No . '' Since then , they had conquered three Inner Ring settlements of our star , Sirius , and at last turned their attention to Lilith . <newline> <newline> We heard only two things as the antimatter struck the *Defender . * With the impact came the signature *snap* of the air as part of its hull was annihilated by the antilithium projectile their cannons fired across the blackness of space , its darkness never more apparent nor its unforgiving nature more evident than it was now . With it came the blinding flash of light that we saw through the video feed , a lethal mixture of nearly every wavelength on the spectrum . Then came the screams of the crew as the air flowed out the cabin , fading away to nothing as the crystals of frozen nitrogen blossomed from the point of impact . <newline> <newline> The gamma-ray blast from the lasers of the Procyan warship followed the antimatter by only seconds , the mirrored hull that was so effective a defense against them now useless . It sliced through to the fusion core as if the tungsten decks were nothing and instantly destroyed the gravity manipulators that compressed the ball of oxygen to combine the nuclei . The hundred-million-degree conflagration engulfed the *Defender* in pure light , the artificial star illuminating the planet below and making the view from the Senate 's window appear -- if only for a second -- like it were day . My gaze turned from the destroyed warship , most of it only energy now , to the screen in front of me , vainly hoping in a corner of my mind that the *Defender* was still transmitting . But there was only blackness on the video feed , the cameras scattered atoms in the void . <newline> <newline> The human spoke , an acidic and sharp noise that stung my ears . `` I 'm sorry , '' he said , his respirator hissing . As if it were not enough that they breathed *oxygen , * one of the most reactive elements known , they gulped the gas greedily through these organs in their thorax that carried enough pathogens to wage biological war . <newline> <newline> The Commanding Officer did not respond to him , his eyes still fixed on the window overlooking Lilith 's surface . His office should have never existed , the necessity of a single Sirian making unilateral decisions being so distasteful to myself and every other Senator , the CO included . But we were at war and needed immediate decisions . <newline> <newline> `` We can continue discussing the treaty when you 're ready , '' the human continued , trying to make such a harsh voice seem gentle . He folded his hands on the table -- hard , bony implements that could crush you in an instant -- and waited for the CO to look back at him through the sharp ridges on his skull . <newline> <newline> The CO looked more defeated than I had ever seen him . `` What is there to discuss ? '' he asked . `` You get everything . The keys to the universe . Faster-than-light travel . It is all yours if you can defeat the Procyans . '' <newline> <newline> The human exposed the bones that jutted from his jaw , turning his mouth upward in what was to him a look of pleasure . `` Of course , Mr. Lutyen , '' he said . `` And at what point would you like us to stop ? '' <newline> <newline> It was despicable , making a deal with the devil such as this . The humans were more dangerous than the Procyans ever could be , surpassing them by leagues in their cunning and ruthlessness but lacking only their desperation . Their minds were always turned to war , more brilliant tacticians and fighters than we could have ever asked for . The fact that their leader was asking us at what point he should *cease* the slaughter of the *Procyans* ... <newline> <newline> CO Lutyen 's pulse dropped visibly in remorse . `` Do n't , '' he replied , looking back at the sky , the aurora from the radiation blazing . `` It must be done . Shatter their government , decimate their population , stop only before xenocide , '' he said , on the verge of tears . I looked around the room , and though the rest of the Senators ' eyes were downcast , none raised an objection that would call for a vote . <newline> <newline> The human nodded his head in agreement . `` On behalf of the United Nations of Earth , I accept your terms , '' he said , motioning for one of his aides . She approached his side with impossible speed , handing him a rectangular black device . `` Excuse me a moment , '' he said , holding it to his oddly-shaped ear . <newline> <newline> `` General , '' he said casually , thinking nothing of the massacre that he would unleash . `` Launch the fleet . '' <newline> <newline> Three revolutions . Only three revolutions was what it took them . They came in their massive warships , painted the blue of their oceans , lighting up our skies with the flashes of Procyan warships consumed by their reactors , driving them back from our star system to their own . Then they landed on their homeworld with their terrifying ground troops , the skies never darkened for the firing of Terran energy weapons . The government surrendered as the first of our colonies was retaken , but the humans held true to the arrangement , horrifying and brutal as the terms were . <newline> <newline> And for what were so many lives sold ? For faster-than-light travel , the only technological edge we ever had over them . The humans reduced the Procyan population to five hundred million , not even a tenth of our smallest colony . An entire race , now only half a billion strong . And , with their star further scorching the planet that was now little more than ash , what were we to do but accept them ? We are n't monsters . <newline> <newline> We only created them .

0,"The way of the *Khoseen* failed me . I spent countless moons learning and mastering it . All for naught . My anger pulsated through the room . All of those present felt my rage . And all but one of those present cowered in fear . They knew the stories of ages long since past . They knew our sins . <newline> <newline> `` Are you so uncivilized ? ARE YOU SO UNDEVELOPED A RACE ? '' I could n't stop it from coming . I broke and my elders ' disapproving image found itself in the back of my mind as I continued the shameful tirade . `` You have broken the laws of the Council . You have ended the great peace that has governed the Two Galaxies for millennia . You have spilled the blood of countless innocents . And for what ? MINTHRAH ? One merely need AGREE to the terms and they would have had it ! '' <newline> <newline> The Pronox representative , unmoved by my burst , merely looked back . Disdain gripped her face . The rest of the representatives of the great races of the Two Galaxies looked on uncomfortably . It was the first time they felt the emotions of my kind . <newline> <newline> “ Yes . For Minthrah. ” She calmly leaned forward and rested her three arms on the Great Table . The shock of the others escaped her . “ Agree ? You watch as our worlds dry up , as our cities die , and as our kind struggle to survive . You know our need . And in your great benevolence , in your great kindness , you offer us terms that would enslave us. ” <newline> <newline> “ We offer terms no worse than what we offer the others. ” <newline> <newline> “ Exactly . Look around this Great Table . Look at your serfs . We are no serfs . We are Pronox . We will take what is ours as you did . We remember how you built your empire. ” <newline> <newline> I trembled in rage , failing my kind . I began to walk out , but turned to add my final piece , “ You are no better than those filthy apes under our watch. ” <newline> <newline> The memory slowly faded and another soon replaced it . <newline> <newline> “ Are you sure ? ” He looked deeply troubled . <newline> <newline> “ Yes ” , I responded . “ It is the only way. ” <newline> <newline> “ We keep them tucked away for good measure . The Council agreed that there would be no contact , that they would be quarantined indefinitely . They can not communicate in our ways . They do not feel the way the rest of us feel . They are a plague . Where they go , they bring only death and destruction. ” <newline> <newline> “ The Council that joined the Pronox and waged war on us ? We are losing this war . If we lose , we will be reduced to nothing – a mere shadow of our greatness . The terms of surrender would ruin us . There is nowhere else to turn. ” <newline> <newline> “ I do not doubt that we can win with them at our side . I doubt a future with them released from their bonds. ” <newline> <newline> “ Were we so different ? And yet we built the Great Table . We oversaw the Great Peace. ” <newline> <newline> “ And we saw to the ruin of those things. ” <newline> <newline> My mind traveled back to the present as the events unfolded around us . Their forces had arrived using the technology we gave them in our desperation . Our mighty fleet failed . Their ships methodically eliminated our planet ’ s defenses . Their warriors disembarked their ships and quickly entered the sacred Temple . The ruthlessness of their war machine astounded me . I had not seen the brutality of it until now . I shut my eyes for a moment of peace and the past drifted into my mind again . <newline> <newline> “ With all due respect , Sir , this is bull shit . Your predecessor signed the terms. ” <newline> <newline> It was difficult for my translator to follow their euphemisms . It was hard enough to capture all of their formal tongues , let alone all the variations of their commoners . <newline> <newline> “ You mean to tell us that we are fighting this fucking war on your behalf and you ’ re going to cap deliveries of the one resource that ’ s necessary to win ? Are you fucking kidding me ? ” <newline> <newline> I looked back at him . “ What is your word ? Ah , yes , 'pillaging ' . You should be able to find enough Minthrah to build your ships on the worlds of our enemies you ’ ve already defeated. ” It was hard not to be condescending . They are so inferior . Yet , there he was , demanding what we would not give them . We could not give it to them . Our hegemony to follow the war was critical . <newline> <newline> Their commander shifted his weight and surveyed me . The way of the *Khoseen* failed me again as it had done when this began . He could somehow feel me . “ I ’ m not letting my men die so you and your little council can keep whatever power you ’ re holding onto . I expect deliveries to continue pursuant to the terms of our deal . If you do not hold your end of the bargain , expect repercussions. ” He turned and left . <newline> <newline> My eyes opened again . Sadness and regret emanated from me like a beacon . 'Falling on deaf ears ' as the apes said . That euphemism made sense at least . I could hear movement outside . <newline> <newline> Our only choice was to stop them . We had to try to destroy their battered war machine before they attained more Minthrah and eventually turned their cold gaze upon us . An explosion and a burst of light filled the chamber . The burst faded and flashes from their weapons filled the room instead . A coldness I have never felt before gripped me . <newline> <newline> “ Fucking pathetic , dude . These shits die without so much as a peep . Kind of boring. ” <newline> <newline> “ Mike , did you not read the god damn briefing about these guys ? Or did you even bother Googling that shit ? Of course not , you ’ re a fucking idiot . They don ’ t communicate verbally . Mental telephathy type stuff. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh , right . Whatever , Vladimir. ” <newline> <newline> “ Shit . Isn ’ t this their leader ? He ’ s still alive. ” <newline> <newline> “ Who cares ? Our orders were ‘ kill on sight ’ . Put one in his ugly fucking mug. ” <newline> <newline> A gun shot rang in the hallowed chamber . <newline> <newline> “ What chow we gon na get tonight you think ? ” <newline> <newline>

0,"I posted this to a similar WP a little while ago . I made a few modification to fit the prompt better . Hope you like it . <newline> <newline> Recently appointed Subantian President : “ ... What have these “ earthlings ” done to warrant exclusion from galactic society ? <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ Mr . President ... These ‘ earthlings ’ must be an exception ! Have you seen the recorder playback of their behavior ? Their ‘ World War 1 ’ , ‘ World War 2 ’ , various ‘ genocides ’ . ‘ Genocide ’ , a term that we had never even conceived of ! The complete eradication of a species or race - *complete eradication ! These earthlings , repeatedly attempt , or actually implement ! <newline> <newline> Millions , if not billions of their OWN species dead , often in the most horrible ways never imagined ! ! We cant ! We cant make them aware of us , let alone invite them to fight for us ! Regardless of the losses we have suffered to the invading Triblabians , we can ’ t bring them into the galactic society , we CAN NOT , it will be our end , better to surrender to the Triblabians , now. ” <newline> <newline> President : “ Secretary of War , just make it so , Now ! ” <newline> <newline> 6 Earth months later ... <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ Mr . President , we gave the Earthlings antiquated weapons technology , we gave them sub-light , and interstellar jump travel , and a few cargo ships , along with access to one of our out-dated manufacturing planets. ” <newline> <newline> Secretary of War , continuing : <newline> <newline> “ The Good News : The back of the Triblabians fleet is broken , most of the worlds they captured have been returned , or recaptured . The Triblabians have sued for peace , and are offering unconditional surrender . The Bad news : the Earthlings sir ... They refuse to return to us the planets they took from the Triblabians . They call it ‘ the Spoils of War ’ . ” <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ Sir , if I may say so , it is absolutely frightening what they have done with our technology in such a short time . The cargo ships ... they have become Super dreadnaughts . There is not a single empty space on them that does not have a weapon or guidance system attached . Just one of these ships wiped out over 300 Triblabian battle cruisers . The Earthlings now appear to be designing their own war ships ... <newline> <newline> President : “ Do we have a watch on what they are doing ? ” <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ Yes sir ! However , they have been using something they call ‘ encryption ’ to hide the contents of their designs , and communications . We have a copy of all of their designs , and most of their communications , but we can not make any sense of it. ” <newline> <newline> President : “ Keep a watch on them , and keep trying to get those designs . Anything else Mr. Secretary ? ” <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ Yes sir , their weapons ... They mostly ignored our laser weapons , and developed their own weaponry . They took our sub-light engines , and turned them into massive fusion weapons ! These ‘ fusion cannon ’ as the Earthlings call them hurl magnetically confined fusing tritium at a target , upon impact the target effectively evaporates . <newline> <newline> They took our shielding technology , and made a projection device , they project a shield as a thin beam the thickness of a few molecules , and mounted it on a swivel . They call it a ‘ Vorpal Blade ’ . It can slice through just about anything , they used it on 3ED47 prime , and nearly sliced the planet in half . <newline> <newline> The Earthlings took our tractor technology , combined it with magnetic confinement tech of their own , and made an automated ‘ Space mine ’ . It is an autonomous device placed in an asteroid field . If a ship comes near and doesn ’ t bear the needed id signature , the ‘ mine ’ using the tractor beam grabs near by rocks and using the magnetic confinement fields accelerate them at the enemy ship. ” <newline> <newline> President : “ Have we tried to capture one of these ‘ mines ’ ? ” <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ Yes we did , the results were less than optimal . 3 ships lost , and a 4th badly damaged , half her crew dead. ” <newline> <newline> President , gets up and starts pacing the room ... <newline> <newline> President : “ Anything else to report ? <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ By far the worst weapon is the ‘ Nova Bomb ’ . They used our anti-matter power plant , and turned it into a missile . They place a shield around a power plant , and a remote turn off for the shield , added a small sub-light engine and aim it at a star . When the device reaches the core of the star , they turn off the shield . This causes an annihilation event in the core of the star , resulting in the star going nova ; killing EVERYTHING in the system . It was the use of a ‘ Nova bomb ’ that convinced the Triblabian to sue for peace . Recently , we understand they have been tinkering with our hyperspace jump technology , but as of yet we have no idea what they are doing with it. ” <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ Just a moment Mr. President ... ” < listening to subdural microphone > <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ ummm ... Mr. President , there seems to be 2 problems ... . First , we can ’ t find the manufacturing planet. ” <newline> <newline> President < stopping mid-stride > : “ What do you mean we can ’ t find the manufacturing planet ? ! ? ! ? It is a planet after all . It is not one to go wandering out a jolly jaunt around the nebula , or nip out for a bit of stellar dust. ” <newline> <newline> Secretary : “ ... well actually we can ’ t find the entire system . It seems it is just… gone ... the star , and all of it ’ s planets.. poof ! gone ! ” <newline> <newline> President : ? ! ? ! ? <newline> <newline> Secretary of War : “ The other matter , Mr. President , there is an Earthling here to see you ... She says she is from the ... let me get this straight.. ‘ New Galactic Earth Empire ’ , she is an emissary of her ‘ Imperial Majesty , and Ruler of all the Stars ’ ; and she wants to discuss the terms of our surrender ... ” <newline> <newline>

0,"`` Are the terms acceptable ? '' The Libran representative asked . The term , Libran , was a human one only born because one of thier stars lied in the human constellation of Libra . That , and the librans had a much different concept of language , born from a biologically produced electromagnetic field which linked each one together . In terran research circles , it was assumed to be a product of ancient genetic engineering . For a civilization to have lasted millions of years , some mucking about with evolution was expected , the terrans supposed . Extremely sensitive radio antenna , a faraday shielded room , and sophisticated software was the only manner in which the librans and the terrans could speak . <newline> <newline> John considered the proposal . Elimination of their enemies ( subsequently called the Aresians after some absurd ancient astrological dogma ) and in exchange the Librans would provide the secret to exotic matter ; the fuel source for all faster than light travel . What a devil 's bargain this seemed ; war for trinkets is what it felt like , however the Librans did not impress him so much like when they first arrived in the 21st century . <newline> <newline> The librans were abhorred at the terrans back then . Terrans , despite being the most peaceful they had been in ages , still practiced war . Horrific acts still happened in the corners of the world . The librans left , disgusted at these barbaric cannabalistic savages . Still , the terrans grew and became powerful in their own way . They now had colonies in Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani . Billions of souls were now spread across their few meager homes , much different than most of their 21st century ancestors would expect . <newline> <newline> Exotic matter , and thus FTL , would give the Terrans the galaxy . They would spread and transform every world , every star , to suit their own needs . If nothing else , Terrans could not stand dead matter . The librans must know that , John thought . They must be desperate to come to them . <newline> <newline> `` Potentially . Any agreement will require a popular vote amongst all our colonies . We require 40 hours for the vote . It would assist us to have any and all data about the Aresians so the populace can make the most informed decision . '' <newline> <newline> The information was transmitted to both colonies via quantum entanglement devices ; the one loophole in light speed the Terrans did know how to exploit . Zettabytes of information from the Librans came across and was thoroughly analyzed by the collective computational capacity of the Terrans , and while the atrocities of the Aresians were displayed throughout their domains . The Terrans realized something about the Aresians : they were unafraid . <newline> <newline> Forty hours later , the results of the vote arrived . 67 % In favor of war . The terrans were prepared to make the faustian bargain for the rest of the galaxy . John told the Libran ambassador the news . `` We accept the proposal . Provide us with the details of creating exotic matter , and we will finish your war . '' <newline> <newline> The librans provided the secrets of exotic matter . Terran nano-factories across Epsilon Eridani , Tau Ceti , and Sol began producing engines within an hour . Within twelve hours , 7000 were ready for use . The weapons selected were terraforming class smart-matter replicators , capable of turning any rocky body within 5 earth masses into gigantic turing machines . They were weapons of slow destruction on such large bodies , but worked quickly on smaller masses , such as enemy starships . Within one earth day , the fleet was ready , staffed copies of volunteers from all the colonies , willing to take responsibility for the killing blows . <newline> <newline> The librans watched with growing horror as the fleet departed ; the size and scope of the attack was impossible . They expected the humans to distract the Aresians while the Librans could come up with a defensive strategy . Instead the Terrans took the fight to the Aresians with devastating effectiveness . Smart-matter terraforming slowly destroyed the rear worlds of the Aresians and pulled their fleets into disarray . The terran ships which never contained anything but the uploaded mind of a human performed maneuvers impossible for a biological entity . <newline> <newline> Terran ingenuity continued through the twelve days of war . A method of using the FTL drive to tear a star apart was discovered , and used against the heavy military targets of the Aresians . Super-liminal detonations became the norm as the FTL engines were overproduced for the war , something unthinkable for the Aresians and Librans who could n't even make one a week . Terran information warfare wreaked havoc on Aresian communication networks as simple encryption schemes were cracked in no time at all . <newline> <newline> After the twelfth day of conflict the Aresian government signaled for unconditional surrender . The casualties were heavy , trillions dead of both civilians and soldiers . Several stars were smeared across space and their planets lost to interstellar space . As part of the surrender , the terrans chose to forcibly upload the remainder of the Aresian race to exist in a simulated existence for the remainder of time . This process would take many years , but resistance to this would be manageable . <newline> <newline> John met with the Libran ambassador when the surrender was accepted . `` The war is complete , '' John said . `` The Aresians will not threaten you ever again . '' <newline> <newline> The libran ambassador expressed his anguish , `` Was such brutality really necessary ? Did you need to kill so many ? Do you really need to exterminate them all ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We are n't exterminating them . We are putting them somewhere they can not harm anyone ever again . We are fulfilling our end of the contract as we see it . Safety from your enemies ; how much safer can you be ? '' <newline> <newline> `` At what cost ? ! '' <newline> <newline> The libran ambassador seemed almost hysterical . John looked at the being incredulously . `` Did you not think this through at all ? Exotic matter is special , but that 's not what you paid with . Even now ships are traveling to every corner of the galaxy . Every star system with no life is being claimed and terraformed . Soon ships will begin traveling across the intergalactic gulfs to the Magellanic Clouds , Andromeda , and beyond . We shall meet the other civilizations out there , some will make peace , some will make war , but in the end we will be everywhere . For your enemy dead at your feet , you gave us the universe . And for that , we gladly pay . ''

0,"Bringing a primitive species to fight our wars was n't a new idea , in fact , it was the standard procedure for us , the Tchort Empire : We contacted alien races with a known history of violence , and recruited them as cannon fooders , in exchange for any of the plentiful resources the Empire posseses : Sometimes it was fuel , other times whole worlds , and the most primitive ones were happy with technologies outdated eons ago by our scientists . Our sociologists studied beforehand the swapping species in order to offer them what they strived the most for and , most important , did n't make them too powerful , and generally they accepted happily the deal . <newline> <newline> This strategy was proven useless against the Chemosh , who defeated effortlessly , and one after another , all enemy armies we bribed against them . The Nihasa Confederacy fleets were wiped out even before they were able to reach the Angira sector we promised to them as spoils of war , a Pwcca Expeditionary Force that attempted a global-scale landing at Vaghesh 9 planet , simply disappeared , soon after setting foot on its surface and their automated drop ships are still orbiting the planet , like if the Chemosh did n't even care about them . After defeating the T'an-mo , the C 's learnt their price was a gerontological treatment that increased their life span twice , and suspended briefly their war on us to nuke the defenseless T'an-mo planets first , and then hunting down any survivor or fugitive across the sector , until the whole species were effectively extinct . <newline> <newline> We were running out of possible allies , the best ones were already defeated and the remaining factions in the sector were too scared to even listen our offers . Without ranks to defend them , our planets started to fall one after another and we were too few and unexperienced to muster an effective resistance . Instead of it , we dispatched desperate diplomatic ships with instructions to offer anything to anyone eager to help us : full citizenship , our latest technologies , the whole empire 's treasure , whatever they want to fight our enemies . <newline> <newline> One of the latest unsuccessful ships , the Naamah , reached her destiny only to learn the Chemosh already blockaded it . It 's hard to say if it was panic or the feeling that everything was already lost , but the captain decided to flee by performing a blind jump before C 's heavy fire destroys the ship . <newline> <newline> The Naamah jumped out near the edge of the galaxy and far from either Chemosh or Tchort space but in the void , they picked strange radio signals : They were primitive but definitively non-natural : Decoding them and discovering their search was over was the same thing for Naamah 's crew but despite the violent acts the transmissions depicted , Laaron 1 , the onboard sociologist , was n't conviced at all : <newline> <newline> _ The broadcast images seem to be staged , we do n't know if they were actual acts of warfare or it 's some sort of entertainment <newline> _ An species who chooses such entertainment ca n't be peaceful , their offspring would be psychopaths if they were exposed to such material , argued the captain . <newline> _ That 's a common myth but there is n't conclusive evidence about a link between entertainment and mental formation , many scientist do n't see it , heck , there are people who thinks it 's the violent people who produces violent entertainment ... <newline> _ Stop the conference , Laaron -Milcom 33 , ship 's navigator argued- I traced the signals and all of them come from the same planet , see ? It 's a pre-FTL civilization . <newline> _ Sure ? <newline> _ There are n't broadcasts from other nearby planets or any kind of exchange between them . Only same-planet communications . <newline> <newline> The captain , that now wanted to take credit for a discovery that may save their civilization , and his career after making a blind jump , insisted : <newline> <newline> _ If they 're as fearsome as the transmissions we picked , it may be worth to give them ships to attack the Chemosh <newline> _ No way -Milcom protested- we may unleash a greater evil over the galaxy <newline> _ Or planet 's different clans may secede from the central goverment until secesion reach disintegration levels , with groups too small to survive leaving the planet and weakening the main civilization . What kind of ally would it be ? -added Laaron . <newline> _ Besides , Milcom continued , we 're talking about a single planet , even if we managed to recruit all its inhabitants , what could they do against the power of hundreds of worlds ? <newline> _ Come on ! They 're the only civilization we managed to contact , I say we could at least take a peek . <newline> <newline> Of course the captain was right , and Humans were at least as violent and ruthless as the Chemosh were , but what really made them different from all other sentient species and caused fear and repulsion in all other creatures was a lust for resources that could never be satisfied . Even the C 's realized the dangers of excesive growing , and managed to develope a sustainable civilization . That was , in fact , the key to space travel . As each planet reached its limit , its sons were forced to look for food and fuel outside , but humans were already in the verge of a disaster when the Naamah visited Earth , squishing their homeworld to sustain a 12 billion population , more than all Tchort worlds together and as half as Chemosh population . <newline> <newline> At first , the T 's wanted to provide their own ships but there were n't enough vessels to movilize all human armies or factories to build them . Humans , on the other hand , had the industrial capacity and were only more lustful for tech than for resources . Soon , all sizable rocks in the Sol System had at least a mining station and each city , even the ones in space , had a recruitment center . When humans and chemosh finally meet , the first clashes were unresolved , with big loses at each side , but once humans reached other stars , they started mining them and soon , humanity outproduced the Chemosh . <newline> <newline> The war was finally over , but as Laaron predicted , the FTL disbanded humanity that spread across the galaxy , always looking for stars to consume .

0,"It has been an accepted fact for nearly a century that nothing in the known universe can travel at greater speed than light . Due to the great distances of space , light observed from a any given viewpoint may be centuries , millennia , or even eons old . Humanity has scoured the observable universe with telescopes in search of alien life with this knowledge in mind . Even after decades of searching , not one speck of evidence could be found . It is easy to conclude from this that if there is an alien civilization somewhere in the universe , it is beyond our sight 's reach . <newline> <newline> The message first came through at 2:56 AM , June 9 , 2030 at Parkes Observatory in Australia . The central computer recorded the event and notified Dr. Wilse , the head astronomer at the observatory , when he came in 6 hours later . The message was passed off as random radio wave interference coming from somewhere on Earth 's surface . <newline> <newline> It was not until the message came through a second and third time on the same night the Dr. Wilse began to investigate . The computer analyzed the radio waveform and confirmed that all three intercepted signals were exactly the same after ruling out any calculable interference . Dr. Wilse immediately contacted NASA . He knew they were the only group on Earth that could possibly make sense of the message . <newline> <newline> Within two months time , the intercepted message was big news . Every other day , there would be an article in the papers or a segment on national news covering the extensive process of decoding the message . <newline> <newline> The specialists at NASA were at first afraid that if the message truly was from an intelligent alien civilization that it would be nearly impossible to decode . Within the first week of decoding , the computers at NASA picked up on patterns in the encrypted message that could shed light on what was being said . Algorithms were applied to dig deeper into the structure of the alien language . <newline> <newline> After a year of work , NASA had reached a conclusion on the nature of the message . They first confirmed that the message came from a civilization of beings capable of coherent language . They then concluded that the message was a distress signal asking for aid from anyone who receives it . The message also contained coordinates of the alien system . <newline> <newline> In order to double check their work , NASA sent their findings to other scientific groups across the globe to ensure that the message was truly one from an alien species . The findings were confirmed by every group as valid . <newline> <newline> The impact of such a discovery was enormous . People were in wonder while others were in fear . The Earth buzzed in excitement of its new discovery . <newline> <newline> Within a year , a mission to send an unmanned vessel containing food , water , various gases , and technology to the alien civilization was in development . The technology for increased space-travel speed had been developed nearly a decade prior . Such technology allowed for the vessel to reach the planet within 50 years instead of 1000 . Some argued that 50 years would still be too long a time and that any alien civilization would be dead by the time the vessel reached the system , but it was the best humanity could do . <newline> <newline> The vessel launched out of Earth 's orbit towards the alien system as the Earth settled in to wait for 75 years , giving 15 years time for the vessel 's radio signals to reach Earth . <newline> <newline> Approximately 75 years later , Earth was buzzing once again . <newline> <newline> Finally , humanity would be able to see an alien civilization through the cameras mounted on the vessel . A countdown to the cameras ' power-up was broadcast on international television . Every eye was watching . <newline> <newline> The clock reached zero as the screen across the globe flickered to an image of the alien system . What was seen sent a feeling of horrible dread through all of humanity . <newline> <newline> In the center of the shot was two halves of a planet with a large gash of empty space between them . Bits of rock and ice floated between the halves in the gash . The surface of the planet appeared to have no atmosphere , and there appeared to be molten lava boiling on the surface . The system 's sun , which glowed with an ancient red hue , was fatally close to the planet . Any hope for life in the system had been cleared away with this image of a dead planet and a dying sun . <newline> <newline> Across the two months , information came through as robotic pods built to deliver the materials investigated the planet 's surface . <newline> <newline> Various materials were gathered from the dead planet for carbon dating . The computers did not indicate any sign of life . <newline> <newline> The materials an information sent in was processed by NASA slowly to ensure that no details of the planet 's demise were overlooked . <newline> <newline> The conclusion was simple : <newline> An alien civilization was present at one point in time on the planet . <newline> The civilization had reached a considerable peak in its development . <newline> The alien civilization did not die out due to circumstances it had caused on its own . Something killed the civilization . Something from someplace else beyond the human view of the universe brutally murdered the alien civilization with a swift blow . <newline> <newline> The final piece of information is what shocked humanity the most : <newline> Carbon dating indicated that the destruction of the alien civilization had occurred over 50 million years before humanity had even received the distress signal . <newline> <newline> Just as light can take eons to reach Earth , so can radio waves . For 50 million years , the distress signal bounced helplessly through space , and every cosmic body it reached further slowed its arrival to a planet with beings capable of aid . <newline> <newline> The dreadful discovery led to two questions : Who or what deliberately destroyed the alien civilization , and could it still be out there , even after 50 million years , searching for more life to prey upon ? <newline> <newline> Edit : Sorry if this is not great . I 'm tired and this is a pretty rough sketch of my general ideas .

0,"`` I do n't understand general , how can you expect to beat them with so few ! ? '' <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ambassador ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We gave you their numbers ahead of time . They have over 200,000 units in the city ! Why did you only bring 300 of your own ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Ambassador , you also gave us their equipment specs , a full layout of the city , and videos of their tactics . 300 is really all we needed for this operation . Honestly we probably could do it with half this , but reinforcements never hurt . '' <newline> <newline> `` I ... I do n't understand . How can you expect to win such a fight . You sound so sure of it . '' <newline> <newline> General Adams chuckled for a while at the Ambassadors worry . The videos of the enemy were painful to watch on first view . You may as well have given 18th century farmers high powered rifles . <newline> <newline> `` Ambassador , there 's more to winning than having the biggest guns . Well , assuming you want to conquer . From what we understand this is the first galaxy spanning conflict in over 200 centuries . The enemy clearly lacks the evolutionary honing to be a threat . '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand . They have weapons that can obliterate half of your 300 men with a single shot . What else is there other than such weapons ? '' <newline> <newline> General Adams sighed , the ambassador was too far removed from conflict . He did n't see what every soldier in the war room saw when watching the videos . <newline> <newline> `` Ambassador what the enemy lacks , is a thing called tactics . Humans have been honing this skill for generations . It 's not about finding a weapon that can kill a guy , it 's about finding the best possible way to kill the guy with the weapon . Here , please pull up zone sigma block 43c . We 're about to start our operations there . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sigma 43c ! ? But , but that 's the enemies headquarters ! Over half their troops are stationed there in a massive building ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Exactly . Who in the world would be dumb enough to do that ? But I suppose we are n't on my world anymore . '' <newline> <newline> `` I ... I do not see . Are you committing all of your units to that one location ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , just Alpha Squad . Commander Reeves , this is General Adams . What is Alpha Squad 's status ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Reeves here general . Little bored over here , but ready to go . Is it really gon na be this easy ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Have n't seen anything to say otherwise . Commence operation 'Hello from Earth ' boys . '' <newline> <newline> 300 voices blasted into the room over the communications line simultaneously . <newline> <newline> `` Sir , yes sir ! '' <newline> <newline> The Ambassador had been warned when he suggested the idea . This species , so small on a planet tucked away in an otherwise lifeless galaxy under a tiny sun , was dangerous . The politicians had watched them play with their dirt and mortar . building `` cities '' and poor excuses for a civilization . Even their weapons , causing only small area damage and being woefully ineffective in the long run were laughable . No one could ever figure out why the anthropologists were so afraid of them . Every species had a calculable danger level . Even their current enemies had been assigned roughly a 6 on a scale out of 10 . The few times a 9 or higher had appeared , it was clear why . Warlike civilizations budding throughout the universe . They were quickly dealt with as their armies first left their planet . But not humans . Most anthropologists came back with the strangest answer , `` they do n't fit the scale '' . <newline> <newline> Today the ambassador understood . They had given them nothing more than information a few months ago . No new weapons , no technology , just some maps , documents , and videos . As the 5 humans in Alpha Squadron stood and simultaneously launched a single RPG each at Sigma 43c 's primary structural supports , the ambassador looked on amazed and horrified . The building collapsed in seconds . In no more than one of the humans minutes , half the enemy force was gone . The select few that made it out the door were quickly shredded with turret machine gun fire . <newline> <newline> `` Hah ! Ca n't believe that went so smoothly . No scouts , no barricades , no structural reinforcement , and all packaged so nicely in one spot . Delta Squad , how did it go with you boys ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Delta reporting in general , similar story here , the EMP took it all down before they knew what was going on , and the satchels took care of anything alive . We 're gon na double check that all hostiles are down before we pull out . '' <newline> <newline> `` Poor bastards , Delta was working on their communications hub . I bet they spend the rest of the day wondering what the hell happened down here . '' <newline> <newline> The ambassador finally managed to stammer out his question <newline> <newline> `` H ... h.. how many did you just kill ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Hm ? Well there will always be a straggler or two I suppose , but with their comm networks down and the snipers we placed , they wo n't last long . They do n't know how to retreat or hide . So I suppose by the end of the day , all of them . '' <newline> <newline> The ambassador was sitting before he realized it . It had happened so quickly , so efficiently . The only comparison he could bring to mind was a master artist . Everything done so perfectly , so flawlessly , but this species painted death . He had wanted to get rid of a beast plaguing his people , but he had unleashed a monster to do it . <newline> <newline> Edit : words

0,"`` They called us monsters , did you know that ? I mean , they way they pronounced it , it sounded like a cat choking on a bagpipe - but it meant 'monsters ' . Maybe 'demons ' . Does n't really matter . Point is - they were never our friends . <newline> <newline> `` See those little purple bastards were the ones that had that - whaddya call it ? - Galactic Congress thing quarantine Earth . A few other races thought they should come visit , but not our 'benefactors ' . Not ever . We had all kinds of people back home asking 'Where are they ? ' . We 'd look up at the big black sky and millions of stars every night and wonder if we were alone . Turns out , not so much . But those purple bastards sure made us think we were . <newline> <newline> `` But that changed . You changed it , did n't you ? Could n't be satisfied with the worlds that Congress let you have so you decided to go off the reservation . You planned this for a long time too . I can tell . I suppose I ca n't really blame you - I 'd be pretty pissed at being told 'you can only have this much ' too . '' <newline> <newline> `` -- -hrrrkk '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , just hush for now . This 'll be over before you know it . Anyway , you lead a charge across half the damn galaxy , conquering worlds left and right . We had a name for it back home : 'War across the heavens ' . Down right poetical , ai n't it ? Just about the time your boys were knocking on the front door of those purple bastards , they had a ship landing on the lawn of the White House . That 's a big important government building back home , by the way . <newline> <newline> `` There was a lot of talking , a lot of arguing , and in the end , we decided to help . Countries from all over the world were going to send to troops . But do you know who was going to carry the heaviest load ? That 's right - Uncle Sam 's Misguided Children . I 'm whatcha call a bird colonel in the Corps . I love it . Been a fighting man all my adult life . I 've studied warfare and killing and battles and victories and losses for forty years . My people have been fighting each other in wars for thousands and thousands of years . Each war is a little bit more horrific than the last . <newline> <newline> `` That 's why you guys lost so badly . You 're amateurs . Oh sure , you planned out your attacks for a good five or six years , but you just did n't know what the hell you were doing . It 's like watching a little child make a drawing . '' <newline> <newline> `` k ! ggrhh ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I still do n't know what you 're saying . Hell , I 'm not even sure you know what I 'm saying . But they tell me you guys are great with languages . Anyway , the purple bastards gave us those screaming fast ships and we started kicking ass . General Li is a tactical genius - but his talents were wasted on this war . Oh sure , you got us a couple of times there in the beginning when we were adapting our fleet tactics to three dimensions and you caught us with our pants down on a couple of planets . I lost more than a few friends on ... some mudball or another . <newline> <newline> `` But the General decided to allow me to lead Task Force Tango Prime . My mission was to find the leader of the hostile forces - that 's you , by the way - and either kill or capture . Now , I had no intention of capturing you . Sure , some critics will say this turns you into a martyr , but they 're not going to find your body . You 'll just go missing in all this chaos . Your civilians were absolutely unprepared for the shitstorm they just received . Nobody is even going to think about you for a couple of weeks . By that time , we 'll have installed a new government who 's a little easier to work with . My country - sort of like a tribe , you understand - has a history of that . We 've got practice . Fun fact - my country is the only one to fire a nuclear weapon in anger . You know those giant nukes you asked us to stop using against your ships and cities ? Yeah , we used that on our own people . <newline> <newline> `` You look surprised . I told you , we 've been fighting each other for a very long time and we are very good at what we do . We 've tortured people for no more reason than they were wearing the wrong uniform . We 've burned entire cities to the ground to get at a handful of enemies . We 've wiped entire countries and cultures from history . That 's who you 've been fighting . <newline> <newline> `` Well , my boys are probably wondering where I wandered off to about now . To be honest , I 'm surprised you 've made it this long with that big ass knife right through the middle of you . You are a tough old bastard are n't you ? Anyway , I figured before I put this last bullet through your ... head ? whatever ... I figured you deserved to hear that . To know the people that beat you . Any survivors that surrender after this will be allowed to go on . We 'll oversee their government , of course , but they will still have country and culture of their own . We 're not going to wipe out your people . They will be de-militarized though - with force if necessary . You 're just not going to be around to see it . <newline> <newline> Bang .

'' <newline> <newline> *YES* <newline> <newline> `` Begin the demonstration Captain . '' <newline> <newline> The admiral observed the creature carefully as the test commenced . On the moon 's surface below , a man wearing the new Type II Suit trotted out to the center of the testing arena and saluted . Various weapons platforms roared to life around him acquiring their target . <newline> <newline> *ADMIRAL WHAT ARE YOU DOING* <newline> <newline> `` Just observe Ambassador . '' <newline> <newline> The warning sirens blared and the first volley fired . Even in the moon 's thin artificial atmosphere the weapons made a colossal racket . The air itself exploded in fire and death . In an instant it was over . In the center of it all , the man stood unfazed and unscathed , still saluting . A telltale shimmer surrounded him . <newline> <newline> *MOBILE ISOLATION SHIELDS ? CLEVER , BUT WHY ? * <newline> <newline> `` Well you 're right in some regards . Isolation shields take a great deal of time to deploy fully , preventing the soldier from using projectile weapons of their own .

'' <newline> <newline> *CLOSE ... COMBAT ? * <newline> <newline> `` Yes ; captain ? Phase Two if you will . '' <newline> <newline> The target dummies rose like a small forest .

'' <newline> <newline> > Earth Day 11 : Combat <newline> <newline> The Baal admiral paced the deck , waiting impatiently for the analysis of the incoming vessels . <newline> <newline> `` WELL ? '' roared the admiral <newline> <newline> `` Sir I 'm afraid there is no record . '' the tactician replied timidly <newline> <newline> `` Impossible . All ships , this is the admiral , prepare for combat with an unknown foe . Odds are this is the `` human '' race the Oracles supposedly recruited . Expect slightly modified Oracle ships . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sir , this is n't Oracle tech , our instruments would be able to ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Enough , we will see . '' <newline> <newline> As the admiral turned back to the monitors the enemy fleet folded in . Damn the luck , the technician was right . These ships looked nothing like the Oracle design . Like vast eggs with jagged protrusions , they were a bizarre sight . The intel must have been bad , the humans had clearly been involved for quite some time . It did n't matter , they were still new to the theater of war . After all , any ship coming out of a long-range fold can not be combat ready . The humans were far too eager . <newline> <newline> `` Admiral , we are detecting at least twenty Capital-Class ships . Their attention seems to be focused on us , however a ground force has already departed for our strongholds on the planet 's surface . '' <newline> <newline> Too eager . Space-Superiority is far more important . <newline> <newline> `` Have our Orbital Defense grid focus on this battle , we can deal with the ground forces after . All ships , this is the admiral , deploy electro-magnetic weaponry according to Stratagem E. '' <newline> <newline> Within moments the fleet opened fire . Energy beams filled the planet 's exosphere . Metal plating became plasma before the assault ; massive fireballs erupted from inside the hulls . In mere moments ten of the human capital ships were destroyed , peeling apart like ripe fruit <newline> <newline> `` All ships , this is the admiral , seize fire . There is no honor in such destruction . Hail The human craft . '' <newline> <newline> The monitor morphed into the head of a `` human '' . <newline> <newline> `` This is Admiral Tyreal of the Heaven 's Sword . You must be the Baal . '' <newline> <newline> The creature was amazingly calm considering the situation . <newline> <newline> `` Ahh Admiral , '' the Baal practically purred , `` are you ready to surrender yet ? I would hate to reduce any more of your species to dust . '' <newline> <newline> `` Dust is a ... relative term . '' <newline> <newline> The sensors tactician cut in . <newline> <newline> `` Admiral ! We are detecting massive coordinated movement from the destroyed capital ships ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Impossible . Cut the connection and bring up visual . '' <newline> <newline> The monitor morphed again . The destroyed capital ships were just clouds of debris and dust ... <newline> <newline> `` Tactician Tyer , give me a detail view . '' <newline> <newline> As another monitor came to life , it became clear . Not dust , small craft . How devious of the humans . They certainly had no honor . <newline> <newline> `` All ships , this is the admiral , the capital-class ships are a diversion for smaller , close-range craft . Prioritize kinetic countermeasures . Deploy shell-cannons according to Stratagem K-C. '' <newline> <newline> In moments the space around the Baal fleet bloomed with millions of explosions . Shell after shell added to the chaos . <newline> <newline> `` Division B , acquire and destroy the remaining human capital ships . Prioritize any that move to support the smaller craft . Dreadnaught captains , move forward and exert control . '' <newline> <newline> As the massive armor-plated Dreadnaughts moved forward to shield the fleet , the cloud of human craft reached the explosive curtain . Without hesitation , they entered . <newline> <newline> `` What an insane and suicidal species , have the Oracles recruited [ mindless bugs ] to throw at us ? Where is their honor ? '' <newline> <newline> Just then the cloud emerged from the explosive curtain , apparently unscathed . <newline> <newline> `` Impossible ! Deploy our fighters ! '' <newline> <newline> But it was too late , the swarm slammed into the dreadnoughts . The admiral watched in horror as the massive ships practically disintegrated . <newline> <newline> `` What ... what are they DOING ! ? ! '' the admiral screamed in fear . <newline> <newline> The swarm jumped from ship to ship more slowly now , seeming to enter the various baal craft . <newline> <newline> Countless monitors came to life , the captains on them wild with fear . <newline> <newline> `` Admiral we 've been boarded ! The enemy are *KRTCHHH* <newline> `` Admiral the forward line is lost ! '' <newline> `` Admiral we need aid ! '' <newline> <newline> Pulling himself from the nightmare the admiral barked orders with cold determination . <newline> <newline> `` Sound the retreat ! We will rendezvous with the main fleet in the Katilla System ! We may have underestimated them today , but their tricks can not win the war ! '' <newline> <newline> Just then a hideous screeching erupted from the bridge blast doors as they were ripped to shreds . The gaurds ' bodies lay in deformed heaps . A tall suit of armor stepped through . <newline> <newline> `` Ahh Admiral so good to meet you in person . Our previous conversation was cut a bit short . '' <newline> <newline> `` T-T-Tyreal ... How DARE you . '' the Baal stuttered <newline> <newline> `` Enough of your childish blubbering . Surrender now and I shall spare what 's left of your armada . '' <newline> <newline> The Baals face twisted in anger , then in fear as the human raised its weapon . <newline> <newline> `` All ships ... this is the admiral . Cease hostilities and surrender yourselves . The humans have won this day . ''

0,"For centuries we had watched them . They ate , breathed , slept and fucked in a constant state of turmoil . Their species killed each other will a religious fervor that was borderline catastrophic . Petty disputes over land or ideology were settled by oceans of blood . My species could never understand what drove them to such brutal and animalistic behavior . <newline> <newline> We may have been wrong to look down upon them and deem them inferior for here were are now crawling to them on hands an knees for their help . We offered technology , resources , medical advances , star charts , mathematical formulas . Everything we had of any use was brought before them as an offering in hopes that they would stand against the coming tide . <newline> Our first contact had been borderline disastrous . As soon as our scout ship breached the surface multiple fuel power projectiles had honed in on the craft . Only by quick maneuvering and a short blast from the plasma burners had saved the peace mission from utter disaster . When the scout ship touched down our ambassadors were met at gun point . Our ambassadors let themselves be taken . In a tense moment we believed they would simply kill our people and dissect them our projections estimated that there was a 30 % chance of such action . It took seven days of rotation before we were contacted . Our peace mission had been successful . Our ambassadors were alive and had been met with overwhelming success . <newline> <newline> Not only did the humans appear willing to embroil themselves in our conflict they seemed eager for it . Already their forces were assembling . Across the blue spheres continents nation after nation brought their people to arms . How quickly their ranks swelled was astonishing . Almost every able body man and woman had been enlisted and armed in less than twenty rotations or their planet . As we watched them we felt a chill run down our spines . For as long as we had watched them we would have never imagined they would unite in such a fashion . For centuries tribe had killed tribe , even as their technologies had advanced their culture remained the same . They were killers . <newline> <newline> To kill had once been the most horrific thing that could happen to one of my species . That was until the day we had met the destroyers . My people called them the `` Sharook '' , a monster from a story we had once used to scare our younglings . Now the nightmare had come out of the story and seized our home world . For centuries we had prospered and flourished on our home world and beyond . Solar system after solar system we had colonized and formed . <newline> <newline> Then from the dark the Sharooks had come . Their armada swept across our galaxy like a solar wind . In fifty solar revolutions of our home planet our colonies had been decimated . We were not prepared for the brutality and bloodlust they displayed . No prisoners were ever taken . All were slaughtered . The young , the old , the infirm , all had been bled dry by the Sharooks . <newline> <newline> It took them another 50 solar rotations to finally sweep across our homeworld , but they were to late . Our leaders had foretold our fall . Every available transport had been loaded with our people and sent forth to the ARC-492 Galaxy . It took our people four solar revolutions to reach the Humans ' home planet and then we begged . <newline> <newline> 5 Solar revolutions later <newline> <newline> Lt. Zeke Truman stood upon the deck of his Sparrow scout ship as it broke Earth 's gravity . What had once been only for the smartest and bravest of people was now common place for him and his soldiers . The scout ship skimmed seamlessly through the vacuum of space . Five years ago the people of earth had finally met the people from the stars . For the most part they looked like us . Though a bit taller and their looked triangular instead of round . It still kind of made his skin crawl to look into their purple and orange eyes ... <newline> <newline> `` Lt. Truman , sir '' his sergeant said drawing the Lieutenant 's attention away from the window . <newline> <newline> `` Yes sergeant '' <newline> <newline> `` We are almost there , sir , the carrier looks like it is about ready to launch '' the sergeant said shifting from foot to foot . <newline> <newline> The man was nervous , as he well should be . Today they would be tested . Today was the day the war began . They were being deployed to the aliens ' home world today to face a foe we had never seen .

0,"What can I say . Sometimes you do n't get to be the big damn heroes . It was n't for lack of trying , certainly . Sometimes when the right idea comes , the time for it has passed . Those space hippies thought that we were tough enough , rough enough to go toe to toe with the dreaded Tret'knos ! Ya see the sphips thought that we were kroor enough to face the Tretky 's and turn around their losses . They thought we were some kind of monsters ; brutal backwater apes from the blue planet ! Bevakoophon . <newline> <newline> To be fair though , we did n't have the best record . They 'd been observin ' us for a while apparently and the Great Euro Conflict scared'em off for a couple centuries . And I admit , we 're good at killing when we have to be . We certainly were back then . And we were smart . Are smart . <newline> <newline> But the thing is , tumblin ' in space is a lot different to tumblin ' on the floor . We got a grip of flashin ' and fleet orbits pretty quickly and we had trained naavikon ready in less than a 3 spins of a our beloved prthvee . We did our best at applyin ' and developing the tacts and strats we knew to space warfare , but it was too much to grapple in too short a time . The sphips were n't much help , otherwise they would n't have been asking for us in the first place . And what hope had we against an empire that was geared for this kind of thing and had been for centuries ? The old Tretk 's were fearsome for sure , and that deserves to be known and respected.By the time the sphippies pulled us into the sky they 'd lost too much and left it too late . <newline> <newline> We tried to engage them dirt-side after we realised that they had the advantage in the dark . We 'd harrass in orbit and squash any ground forces that would land . We thought that if we could stall the expansion we 'd be able to lock down their fleets and fight them on our terms , which meant raidin ' and destroyin ' supply routes . Not a bad plan , but they 'd encountered that before . They just glassed us from orbit . The materials they needed could be extracted well enough without peeps on the ground . <newline> <newline> We lost , plain and simple . We took a gamble to get us out into the big world and we lost . <newline> Bholee bachchon . <newline> <newline> The sphipps became subs to the tretky 's , and we , for our actions had dear old dharatee maata mined into an asteroid belt . Now we were just brutal backwater apes . Not really though . <newline> <newline> Ya see the Sphipps thought our identity was tied up in all that violence they observed us doing . We used our sharp intelligence as a tool for destruction often and well for sure . But we used it for other things too . What does a guy looking through a telescope at ants cutting up a leaf know what they do other than cut ? <newline> <newline> We may have lost the war , but it was n't entirely grimdark and gloomy . The tretky 's fell to squabblin ' in time , no empire can ever last . And the desperation of the sphippies gave us the tech to finally get out of that system that we 'd been stuck in for so long . Ever since we 'd looked up at those stars we 've wanted to walk amongst them ; to stride through the flickering lights , swim amongst the dust clouds , dance across the nebulas . We do that now , in a less poetic but by no means less wonderful way . <newline> <newline> Now , we 're the vagrants of the stars ; fleets of nomads herding our comets and dust . We trade , we party , we fight . But most of all , we live . We 're not just apes tumblin ' in the dirt ; we 're apes that make music , tell stories , build and destroy , love and hate and do all the mundane things inbetween . We 're colourful creatures . That 's why all the peeps at a sabha wait for us to turn up- because the party do n't start 'til we come in . <newline> <newline> But that is enough for now my little bachcha , it is time for bed . I hear that the orbit sunrise here is particularly sundar .

0,"Upon reflection , the decision to save the galaxy might have been a mistake . The Eholim evolved on a gas planet whose composition allowed for liquid water to rain into the depths . Gossamer wings and antennae and organs of helium sacks allowed their bodies to survive forever in flight . Their home-world was so large that their population was staggering in comparison to species who evolved on Terrestrial worlds . <newline> <newline> The Banadii , a race whose individuals looked like a large wishbone and evolved on a planet not quite unlike Earth , uplifted the Eholim into The Galactic Society with the presentation of dirigibles that housed education computers and manufacturing facilities suited for the gas giant , but would naturally never have been able to be made from scratch on the planet . The Banadii claimed it was the poetry and music of the Eholim that gave them the right to be uplifted . <newline> <newline> However , it turns out the only reason why the Eholim was so peaceful and poetic was because they really did n't have the means for physical conflict in the form that they evolved into , and what the Banadii perceived as beautiful compositions of sound and light , were actually poisonous vitriol of one Eholim insulting another about one thing or another . For example , the Cantabile of the Gates of Heavens , so named by the Banadii , was composed by an Eholim about his neighbor always blocking the sun , getting in the way during feeding , and generally being unacceptably unhygienic . The first mistake was not realizing that the Eholim was a race of mean spirit , selfish intention , and possessed a disregard for everything but their immediate interest . <newline> <newline> The population pressures of the Eholim 's homeworld was so intense that once they had the ability to leave their planet , they instantly started colonizing other worlds , and terraforming gas giants throughout the Galaxy to meet their needs . They drastically changed the mass and compositions of those planets and by doing so , disrupted the orbits of the terrestrial planets of most of the home-worlds Galactic Society was based on . Something had to be done . But what ? No other race had nearly the numbers the Eholim had , well , accept one . Humanity . <newline> <newline> Up until now , the only contact The Galactic Society had with Humanity was to occasionally pick up one that deviated from major population centers , abduct them for study and deposit them back into whatever cornfield or forest they were found in . But with the whole galaxy in disarray because the Eholim , the decision was made to uplift Humanity as well , and turn their energy towards defeating the Eholim in a war of extermination . It was not a repeat of the previous error as such , but an attempt to set the two uplifted races against each other so the rest of The Galactic Society can get back to their parties , and return to the usual business of proper socialization . Humanty was given FTL technology along with the information that the Eholim had colonized Jupiter . This was enough to get the ball rolling . <newline> <newline> The second mistake was not realizing that Humanity actually liked war . They like it a great deal . More than anything . Humanity breeds and fights . The Eholim breeds and fights . The two have been at it for centuries now . Galactic Society is but a pale reflection of what it once was . There can be no parties where there is orbital bombardment . There can not be proper socialization when fleets of barbarians are in your Heliosphere . The Galaxy will never be the same .

0,"Our sin was hubris . We of the Ardas Protectorate races assumed that we were the most advanced group of minds that our immediate galactic sector had to offer . Individually , we were not particularly numerous . Perhaps each race held four worlds to begin with , including their respective Genesis Worlds . Together , however , we made glorious strides in the fields of medicine and exploration . We held our Capitol to be Qur in the Ardas system , and we prospered . <newline> It was with great surprise that we awoke one morning to find that another people from outside the Protectorate , the Therkin , had advanced their people quite as far as we had , and they were not so philanthropic . They bothered little with weapons . Their soldiers were genetically engineered with the most brutal adaptations available on any planet . Many of them could survive hard vacuum for hours . They did n't care for their dead , but simply left billions of reeking corpses specifically to breed diseases that our people had no ability to counter . They unleashed upon our civilians the most destructive fauna from their Genesis World , and all other worlds they conquered . The entire Ardas System was taken in an afternoon , swarmed by mutated half-crazed beasts . In our foolish dream of peace , we had forgotten how to wage war . <newline> Luckily for us , the people of the Sol system were well practiced . We tried to ignore them , as they were much too simple for our liking . The Solars had n't even left their Genesis World . They had existed for millennia without discovering basic principles of physics . The advent of electricity was a power that seemed entirely lost on them , and they used it for entertainment . Then we watched as they tore the fabric of reality to slay those among them who displeased them . Say what you might about the Solars , they were creative . It was decided that they would be considered a dark sector until such a time as they were deemed `` culturally acceptable '' . <newline> Now we needed them . We landed on a planet choked with the carbon residue of their burning home . We called on them and offered our vast resources to be at their disposal . We told them that we were handing over strategic command to their generals . We begged the damn monkeys . They were more than happy to oblige . <newline> In the first cycle , the Solars glassed the Therkin Genesis world to the core . Their warriors were augmented with technology that they had dreamed of using for generations . We had known they were dangerous , but we did not know the extent of their violence . Some of our newest technology already had a place in their culture . They did n't just make warfare , they predicted it ; they fantasized about it . <newline> They handed us the ashes of our system , and with hardly a parting word they carried on their slaughter . The Therkin came to us begging for mercy , but we no longer had control . Every Therkin world lived in fear of the crushing force of the new predators . The Homo Sapiens Sapiens , as they called themselves in the dead tongue of a long deceased empire , had made use of a technique they called Lightning War , followed by the acquisition of the broken planet 's raw resources . As we gazed over the shattered remains of the Therkin , we pondered what hell we had unleashed upon our demons , and whether we now could survive its wake .

0,"The response below is the prequel to a story I wrote for another prompt found here : http : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2j42eh/wp_humanity_is_the_only_race_in_the_galaxy_with/cl8i9yy <newline> <newline> Enjoy ! And as always , please criticize as much as you can - I need it ! <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> Meditating in this room , with its crystalline throne and specialized hydrogen atmosphere , had always put me at peace before . I had ordered the burning of entire planets , demanded that entire fleets of ships be sacrificed to stall an enemy advance , and asked for whole cities to commit ritual sacrifice from this room . All of that paled in comparison to what I was about to do now , and I doubt I will have any peace in the years to come . <newline> <newline> Humanity had always been an oddball race in the galaxy . With the invention of their Kines-Alcubierre Drive , their presence in the galaxy grew like a menacing cancer . Full of war and hate and astonishingly quick technological progress , they quickly butted heads with their alien neighbors . While I 'm glad that my people , the T'vana , were n't the first to discover human violence firsthand , I ca n't help but feel that it might have helped us to learn their ways . Their fundamental differences - borne out by a rare evolutionary path in which they evolved sentience as *individuals* instead of a collection of hiveminds - could have saved us if we had only bothered to learn from them . But the other species in this galaxy , the ten civilizations that feared humanity 's abilities , stifled them instead . With warships and sanctions , we stifled them until they were fenced into a third of the galaxy we all share . <newline> <newline> But now there are only 4 of the original 10 species left . The others are all gone , scattered in refugee fleets or cowering in hidden asteroid bases . All hoping that the Enemy , the REAL nemesis that we should have seen coming , overlooks them . For all the condescension that we showed towards the humans because of their warlike ways , we need them . None of us know how to wage cold , dirty war on a grand scale . The Shuri never moved past dueling as a suitable method of settling disputes , while the Heela refused to even touch weapons . Both species are now seen as museum pieces ; things to be treasured for the short time they have left . The Kaavari aliens from beyond the galactic border do not see chivalry as something to be admired . <newline> <newline> So now I , possibly the last Emperor of the T'vana , am giving humanity the one thing they 've never been able to develop . Their Kines-Alcubierre machines can travel a hundred times the speed of light , but ours ... our ship drives shift *instantly* . If the Terran Empire could fight their way through and colonize a third of the galaxy with such a limited drive , I truly shudder to think of what they will do with this . <newline> <newline> I am sorry , my people . May we go together into the dark , for I fear that humanity will have taken all the light when this is done .

0,"This is my first attemp to contribute something in this subreddit , so I would love to get some feedback . <newline> <newline> I am not an english native speaker , so please excuse grammar / spelling errors in my text . <newline> <newline> I can ’ t remember who came up with this insane idea , but the more time passed the less insane it seemed to ask for help from this dreadful species . The closer the enemy got to our last refugee , more and more people demanded that we acquire help from the Humans . We studied them long enough and knew their behavior . They go to war against each other for minimal reasons and pillage their own planet . They are running low on resources and their attempts to colonize another planet were unsuccessfully . It would be beneficial for both sides . We ’ d defeat our foes and get back our home in exchange to give the human race the technology to spread on another planet . <newline> The idea itself was the most dangerous thing that ever came to my mind . It is like infecting yourself with a mortal disease that kills you slowly , in order to overcome a symptom that kills you now . It seems that our instincts try to find more and more reasons to make this idea look good in order to live on . <newline> We knew how humans communicate and before we set foot for the first time on their planet , we contacted them and made it clear that we come in peace . However as the gates of our ship opened I could not believe my eyes . We chose a wide open space to land . It was not that open anymore as we arrived . Humanity fears everything that is unknown to them and prepared their whole military forces for a possible escalation . I was not sure if they want to capture us and our ship or want to talk about our offer until we finally met their leaders . <newline> We had to take this risk in order to save our species and everything worked out better than expected . <newline> Due to our preparations we had no communication issues and we explained our situation , what we want and what we would give the human race for their assistance . <newline> The council of humans who spoke to us were very interested in the technology we offered them . It didn ’ t take long for them to decide that they want that deal . Even after we told them about our terrifying enemy and that this will be a terrible war with a lot of sacrifices on both sides , they didn ’ t seem to care . <newline> All they saw was these new planets to occupy , the technology and all the possible uses of it . <newline> In this moment I realized again why I hated the idea of acquiring help from this species . Those few people who speak for their entire race would sacrifice everything just to live on and satisfy their own needs . What terrified me the most was , that after their thought of using the technology to explore new planets , they wanted to use it for new weapon technology in order to annihilate every possible resistance that they would face . <newline> We sealed a terrible fate that day . Not only for us , but for our entire galaxy . <newline>

0,"We had been studying them for a very long time . They were , in all honesty , a beautiful species . Unlike the people of the Burbradan , the humans of Earth were sexually dimorphic . The `` females '' as they referred to them , were formed of aesthetically pleasing curves and interesting rounded parts . They were the child bearers of their kind and while on average physically weaker than their `` male '' counterparts , they could bear more physical stresses and were extremely protective of their young . The aforementioned `` males '' were typically larger and stronger than the females . Where the females were curved , the males were linear , possessing a different sort of physical beauty that was also quite appealing . The males too were very protective of their young , but also of their females partners . But that is not what made them unique in the galaxy . Sexual dimorphism was not unheard of . Some species were trimorphic , or were like his own which were asexual . There was also variety in the humans . They existed in different external colorations , ranging from the color of a starless night , to the color of a white hot flame . Not just their skin , but their eyes and hairs came in different colors as well . That just made the humans even more pleasing to look at . But it also created dissent between the humans . The sentient species of every other planet and a certain sameness about them . One k'Thari looked pretty much like another . But humans , they were different from each other . <newline> <newline> And they hated each other for it . <newline> <newline> Well , they had in their past at least . This hatred though , went beyond the `` we do n't like you '' hatred . It had gone so far as enslavement , endless wars , holocausts , and attempted genocides . The humans and inflicted countless horrors upon each other in ways no civilized species had even attempted . Yes , some other species had done terrible things , but not to themselves , and not in so many ways . The hated was not just abut colors , but about beliefs , about resources and about most anything else one could think of . The humans though , in their endless hated of themselves , had forged themselves into something beautiful and terrible to behold . They had beauty in form and art and song and violence . No other galactic species had perfected themselves in the way the humans had . <newline> <newline> And it terrified us . We , in agreement with the other responsible civilizations of the galaxy had set aside the humans of Earth as `` Do Not Contact '' . We decided they needed to stay where they were . <newline> <newline> Until the Swarm came . We knew very little about them , because most contact with them has resulted in annihilation . They came . They saw . They conquered . They consumed . They moved on . <newline> <newline> In our fear of The Swarm , we agreed to reach out to the humans . We needed their skills in violence . And since the humans had recently settled the majority of their own complaints amongst themselves , it turns out they were , as the human phrasing goes , `` itchin ' for a fight '' .

0,"We did n't have any other choice , we were on the back feet in the war , our home-world was in the throes of being completely erased from the galaxy and the Galactic council was n't offering any aid . There was even talk of them instigating and funding the attacks as an attempt to buy time for themselves . They say that because it ’ s an internal system dispute , they could n't and would n't interfere , then wished us luck . <newline> <newline> We know why they ’ re doing it , we ’ re the yang to our neighbors yin , built sturdy and reclusive , while they ’ re wiry and manipulative . Our neighbors are known as the Lits , a species that developed alongside our own in a one in a trillion chance ; their world green and blue , ours red and brown . They evolved to be conceited , to strive to be the strongest possible , but together , united against everyone that stands in their way . <newline> <newline> They made first contact with us nearly 300 years ago , dropping from the sky in massive machines , intent on completely wiping us out . We ’ d never developed weaponry , being all of one culture , faith , and mind , but we had evolved in one of the harshest environments possible , and that made us so hard to kill that they gave up and offered peace . However , now they ’ re back and completely able to annihilate us entirely . <newline> <newline> In a last ditch effort , we smuggled technology into one of the only completely blacklisted star systems in the galaxy , to a planet whose inhabitants continuously wage war upon themselves , decimating millions of life forms and turning entire continents into what should be uninhabitable land . Yet they inhabit it , and they thrive . These brutal peoples repopulate at rates not a single race in the galaxy has ever seen , and live immensely long lives despite it , spending more than half of that time alive in absolutely prime condition for fighting . Their primitive technology is killing their entire planet before their very eyes , and yet they barely even acknowledge it amongst all the destruction . <newline> <newline> To these people , we offered a method to expand their empire and gain a foothold on a much grander stage , for a simple price : that they use it first to obliterate our enemies , after which we have promised payment of even greater technologies . They accepted . In a mere what they call “ two Earth years ” they ’ d taken the FTL technology we provided them with , and created weapons of destruction and means of transport so far advanced that we feared their further payment would only make them angry with us . Almost as soon as those Earth years had passed , they moved in on the Lits . <newline> <newline> We now know they do not need any further payment in the form of technology . Every single thing the Lits had is now theirs , even their home planet , on which they unsurprisingly strive . Our former neighbors are extinct . Our new neighbors are known as Humans . We think a Human saying is very appropriate in this situation , “ Out of the frying pan , and into the fire . ”

0,"As *THEY* came we all stopped what we were doing . We left our homes , our workplaces , religious temples and stared . We stared in disbelief . <newline> How long did it take ? Mere weeks . It was a strange preposition . <newline> <newline> Councilman Avurr stood on the podium and spoke to us : <newline> <newline> `` Fellow Dalurians . We have to make a difficult choice . Death is upon us , and we can not stop it . '' <newline> <newline> The council murmured , no one knew what we should do . What we could do . <newline> We never knew war . We have been living as a single entity all our life , and this strange race which we call `` Devourers '' had come to destroy us - They never gave a reason . <newline> But the Councilman did n't stop there . <newline> <newline> `` But there is a race that can . The humans of earth have shown brutality that rivals that of the Devourers , and I have sent a request to them to aid us . They will receive our FTL technology , but we will survive . '' <newline> <newline> An uproar . The FTL technology passed on to a race so bloodthirsty ? I have studied them for decades now . The Devourers , yes , they come and destroy without mind or reason - but *humans* ? <newline> <newline> They are calculated . They are brutal . They are ... special . <newline> The humans are not like us . They are divided into many tribal regions that prey on each other for the most miniature gains . <newline> Our brightest scientists do not understand the differences between those human tribes . What makes the `` American '' tribe so different from the `` French '' tribe , the `` Mexican '' tribe . Or any of the hundreds and hundreds of tribes . <newline> Only a human can discern the different tribes from one another , and if asked would give reasons that none of us could understand ; `` He has a darker skin colour '' , `` He greets people differently '' , `` They wear different clothes '' , `` Whorship another god - or none at all ! '' . <newline> <newline> And yet , here they are . Destroying the ships of the invading Devourers with such precision and destructive force . Thousands of human ships swarming our home planet . Like the `` Ant '' creature that are native to the Earth . A hive mind bend on killing with cold calculation . <newline> <newline> They sent us this letter as an answer : <newline> `` We the United Nations Alliance will send 400 Destroyers , 700 Falcon-Class Ships , 30 Carriers and 2000 Interceptors . Our risk-assessment suggests a minimal loss of life , and more importantly a insignificant economical cost for this war effort . <newline> We look forward to the payment and future business . <newline> Signed , Tonald Drump , CEO and Head of the UNA of Planet Earth '' <newline> <newline> I hope it will not come to haunt us , inviting the monster to our doorstep . Trusting , that *they* will not turn on us once the Devourers are defeated , for what are we if not a planet ripe for sacking and exploitation in their eyes ?

0,"For anyone who has played the Mass effect series ( SOME SPOILERS ) , this is a WP I made for an alliance soldier who is stuck on earth following the attack of the reapers ( Mass effect 3 ) . <newline> ( also my dates are probably going to be slightly off compared to the game ) <newline> <newline> October 17th , 2186 CE <newline> <newline> 1st Lieutenant James William Morris of the 501st Alliance marines <newline> <newline> I 've lost all my previous recordings , including my grandfathers recordings that he made while in the first contact war ; the sad part is I do n't think anyone else would have gotten to hear them anyways . The reapers have finally attacked and I lost over half of my platoon within the first half an hour . I thought I 'd truly seen the most devastating thing any man would ever witness after the destruction of Harbinger . Now there are what seems like hundreds of these things killing millions of civilians every hour . What used to be a beautiful and thriving city is now piles of rubble with few building left standing . The hardest part for all of us was seeing Commander Shepard fly out of orbit , even if he 's going to bring back help the men need a hero at their sides now and again ; shit at least we still got Anderson . <newline> <newline> Lt. Morris logging out <newline> <newline> <newline> October 21st , 2186 CE <newline> <newline> We did calibrations for the damage so far , 2.8 billion civilians , 568 million soldiers and 1109 alliance warships are all gone . Yesterday I was promoted to Captain and put in charge of 280 marines , the ground warfare has been more devastating then ever . The Reapers have a new and stronger force worst of all what the men have started to call a `` Brute '' has to be at least 25 feet tall . This morning I sent my new Lieutenant David Franco with a group of 90 marines to secure a forward position in the broken streets of Vancouver . Three of these brutes came from the rubble and tore them all to pieces . I ordered my artillery to bomb the whole area in code 'DANGER CLOSE ' . At least 20 my marines disobeyed orders and charged in to try and save what men where left , my artillery killed everyone in the blast zone . Drained from moral and only half my men left I ordered retreat . <newline> <newline> I thought about resigning my position to someone who would better suit the role , only to hear that my platoon was the only one that survived it 's field mission today . When I went into the officer barracks I asked `` where is the CO ? '' only to have a young boy hand me a letter saying `` your all thats left sir '' . I read it only to see that our last hero , Anderson , has retreated to London . <newline> <newline> Lt. Morris logging out <newline> <newline> <newline> This is part one , I wrote it fairly quickly and have thought about touching it up , either way if you want to hear the rest of Lieutenant James William Morris ' story and what happens to the 501st Alliance marines let me know !

'' Admiral James T Kahn sat confidently on the bridge of the newly christened flagship of the Earth Space Superiority services . <newline> <newline> Soon , it would be engaged in battle with Rodentia . `` They think they are so smart '' thought Kahn , but quickly his thoughts turned to snapping their little necks . The insidious weapons designed to suddenly trap their enemies had been designed eons ago . Now , they would be put to the ultimate test . <newline> <newline> Of course , the humans were n't entirely without mercy , in the hold they had tons of emergency food and other supplies for their new allies . Just as predictably , the nets contained in the secondary hold would be useful for AFTER the main battle . <newline> <newline> The Earth fleet arrived at the Cetacean home system just in time . The Rodentian forces were close to final victory . Quickly , the weapons of mouse destruction they had brought with them were deployed . Soon , the sounds of snapping necks and cries of `` 42 '' filled the air . Kahn smiled and thought to himself , `` Behold , the power of cheese '' . The secret had been obvious all along . <newline> <newline> He gave a nod to the load master , indicating it was time to deliver the emergency supplies in the hold . Tons of food were quickly delivered . <newline> <newline> A short time later , the relief in the squeaks , squeals , chirps and whistles coming from the Cetaceans was obvious even if the computer translation was slow to provide the final translation . They seemed excited and happy . <newline> <newline> Admiral Kahn , smiled . Soon the humans would reap the tasty morsels they desired from the Cetacean homeworld . That 's where the nets came in . `` Chicken of the Sea '' would be on the menu all they way back home . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , a shrill cry came from the Cetaceans and all the power on Kahn 's ship was lost . Their weapons , their defenses all offline . What was going on . The Cetacean attack was decisive and the humans defenseless . <newline> <newline> Kahn was stunned , if they had this kind of power , what did they need the humans for ? The Cetaceans knew of course . The power source the Rodentia used were immune to their power draining weapons . They used a subclass , cousins really , of their own species . Thousands of them , running on gigantic wheels to power their ships and weapons . But all that was in the past , the humans had done their job . <newline> <newline> The end came swiftly for Kahn . The arrogant smirk removed from his face . As his beautiful flagship burned around him , he saw the final salvo from the Cetaceans . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , a loud beeping sound came from his right . He turned his head just before the final strike to see . <newline> <newline> As Kahn looked toward the comm system , he saw the translation of the earlier message from the Cetaceans , `` So long and thanks for all the fish '' .

0,"first time posting , this WP had my head filled , so here goes . <newline> <newline> I leaned back , to stunned to stop the playback on the console . I could not comprehend the horror that this one single message contained . The voice filled the chamber , the one voice that had guided my people for more than 50 years . <newline> `` All evacuation ships , make for Distant Observation Post # 33826 . Seek shelter , and survive . This is the last directive I give you . Be brave , for you have made me proud to lead the Chitari ...

They had finally razed our planets . They offered no words to my people , no warnings . Only never ending greed , hate , and death for my friends and family . <newline> I thought I had escaped all of this . I thought that in taking the Command Position of this Distant Observation Post , Station # 33826 , would keep me safe from harm . Granted it was well benith my training , only having three staff , and then me as the commander . But I was afraid , I was a coward . I never thought I was capable of leading a ship to combat . <newline> This post was simple , observe and prevent outside contact of the Sol system . Prevent contact , ment destroy any attempt to leave the Sol system . An easy enough task , as this system contained only one sentient race . A group known as Humans . After being here for 20 years , my crew and I even began to take on the simple nomanclature for the planets around this small sun . <newline> Determination filling my head , I turned , and rushed quickly on four legs out the door . I had to reach the rest of my friends for the last 20 years . Pushing open the door at the end of the hallway , I entered the main deck . A large room filled with the soft glow of observation screens and the whirl of fans keeping the air moving , located close to the surface of Triton , I could not have felt more lost . <newline> `` The worst fears of out people have come true ...

He still had no idea why so many of them congregated on such a small string of islands , but logic -- and protocol -- dictated that a planet 's largest city/hive/nest was often that world 's capital . <newline> <newline> He was sure this `` Toh Kee Hyoh '' was the right choice , even if he had to keep bowing . <newline> <newline> One approached him and bowed . `` Honoured guest , our leaders are ready to see you now . '' <newline> <newline> He copied the bow but not the smile . That unnerved them . `` Thank you , honoured host , '' he said . `` Please lead the way . '' <newline> <newline> He followed the local leader through several hallways under an honour guard . Most were tense , even dressed in their own suits Kyloran could sense they were ready to kill or die . It comforted him to know he had made the right choice in selecting this species . <newline> <newline> Two servants pulled the doors back and Kyloran padded down his suit before walking in . A bright light ringed the long table and a variety of the planets ' leaders stood beside their seats . <newline> <newline> He walked to the head of the table and sat as instructed by his host . They had worked out their strategy for this meeting , and Kyloran had decided to trust his host 's plan . He had been briefed on each one . <newline> <newline> `` Mr. Tianpu , Mr. McMillon , '' he nodded to his left and right . `` Hirano-san , '' he said warmly to the greying local who smiled back . Nobuyuki Hirano had been close with his host and had provided several gifts which had proven useful in understanding the world . He had wanted to speak with the planet 's government , or barring that the leaders of the largest nations . But Hirano-san had shown him who held power on this world . Kyloran did n't like it -- this world 's democracy was probably their greatest invention -- but he was here on a matter of life and death , his people 's . The humans would have to fix it themselves . <newline> <newline> Their familiarity caused the rest to exchange glances , but he went on naming each one after a brief pause . He could name their organizations as well , their revenues , everything they held dear . But he did n't mention that . <newline> <newline> `` Greetings . I am Kyloran Estraxx , ambassador of the Payapa Unity . I welcome you , the corporate leaders of Earth , to our first conference . Or rather , our negotiations , '' he said with a smile . <newline> <newline>

0,"I arrived on Kravidus with the first wave . Our drop ships fell from the sky like a plague upon these people . We did n't care who they were , what they were . We had been told that they were fierce fighters and we were here to test their mettle . We estimated they lost three hundred thousand in that first assault . Our troops hit them hard and fast all over the planet and their defences crumbled like so much wheat before our scythe . <newline> <newline> We had been told that they were fierce , that they were strong . We were told that we would die . But we crushed them . We drove them from there bases and their bunkers . The ones who stayed to try and fight we strung up . We hung them , still living , on the armour plating of our grav tanks and we let their allies churn them into bloody paste as we advanced upon the next target . <newline> <newline> When we hit their cities we burned everything . We did n't know if the ones we killed were fighters , women or children ... all these freaks looked the same . I have learned since that only their skin pigmentation marks either their sex or their gender . I have yet to meet one I have n't pulled the trigger on . <newline> <newline> The Nathul gave us technology to help them . They were advanced but weak , feeble bodies unable to take the pain of war . Over time their attitude has changed . At first I saw disgust in the eyes of the ones who command us but now ... now I see fear . They have finally realised what they have unleashed upon their enemies . <newline> <newline> I hear that Earth is peaceful now . It has been 15 years and 26 planets and still we fight , still we conquer and kill to keep our people traveling throughout the stars . Their is nothing to prove in violence at home any more , any man with a lust to kill and fight just signs the Defence Docket and makes his way to the Hub . The only way to test yourself now is to journey Starside and stay alive . <newline> <newline> Our enemies have learned since our arrival . They have come to realise that what they consider to be war is nothing but a game to us . We came and changed the rules , we came and razed their cities and ground their people into the dust . We came and took with a viciousness what they had taken themselves . <newline> <newline> I wonder what will happen when the Nathul no longer have use for us . I sit and think about the test they run , the samples they take . I wonder what they think when they turn their eyes towards Earth , the planets we have colonised since and consider what awaits them now . I have yet to meet a man who has been Starside as long as me but I know that I will be long dead before this war is over but I can not escape the looming thought of the war that comes when this one is finally finished . <newline>

I do not know . <newline> <newline> I live alone , my spores and children live among the stars , our music shared over eons . We sing to please the All Father , but All Father was not there when the voices began to silence . Harmony replaced with pain .

Insects and non sentient life served us , lived through us , and in kind , we served them . Harmony in the universe . <newline> <newline> It was non-life that came for us . Infection . Cancer .

All He lived and died many times , so quickly , but the communities of All He grew on Yellow Son . Her children , a blessing from the All Father . Then , the infection came to Yellow Son . <newline> <newline> All He gave many sentient lives to save Yellow Son . All He saw the infection , the unlife , and chose to save life . Yellow Son , mother of All He , spoke to her children , and then made the greatest sacrifice since the dawn of life .

0,"The concept of monsters had never previously existed , but the Cooperative quickly adopted it from the Humans ' own literature . It was the species ' concise bildungsroman , and their raison d'être . So many words . So much languages . So much *culture . * Understanding of new works rippled throughout the planet , each new one driving home the plausibility of the absurd dates on these otherwise obviously false accounts . These stories were over a thousand years old . Humanity was the oldest race to ever achieve spaceflight , and they 'd spent the whole time fighting amongst themselves . <newline> <newline> The Barycenter understood why , of course . Words were more than just storage for these otherwise unremarkable air-breathers . It was their only means of communication . The poor souls had never known the mind of another . They dealt with falsehoods as a matter of course . No wonder they revered such absurd stories - `` fiction '' was their means of training . The concept amused some and bothered others . To neither accept or reject an account 's veracity , but to recognize its wrongness and still remember it ... it was like sharing an unfinished thought . The Cooperative settled on the word `` perverse . '' <newline> <newline> A quiet chill crept across the world . Some of these stories were n't `` fiction . '' The Barycenter picked one book at random , easily skimming through . An hour of individual discoveries had left everyone with a practiced understanding of the primary recorded languages . The Barycenter wished it were otherwise . Many wars were really fought . Many millions died . Some were exterminated systematically , often for taking the wrong fictions seriously , or for accepting certain nonfictions . Even their spaceflight technology was a thinly-disguised weapons program . <newline> <newline> Memories of his own species ' worst tragedies bounced around slowly , each one briefly requiring an individual 's full attention . The first city 's famine in Year 5 . Multiple massacres by delirious individuals following the invention of firearms c.30 . The 54 shuttle crash , claiming 510 lives . The Barycenter 's own parent had died in an accident just last year in 107 , and nearby citizens shared the pain . None of this even registered on the scale of Human tragedy . They 'd fought world-spanning conflicts before the Cooperative had even bridged the continental divide . <newline> <newline> The vast horror of Human history subsided , leaving their present in everyone 's minds . There was no question of ability . Any discoveries shared from the Cooperative 's long and proud history of technological progress would inevitably be turned to weapons . The stark choice before them all was material destruction by the merciless forces quickly approaching ... or survival in the shadow of a desperate mistake . A terrible consensus arose from the threatened masses . The Barycenter shuddered in radio silence , knowing the answer before it came .

0,"`` Please ... '' The request was weak and desperate . Her ruddy eyebrows peaked in the middle and framed her dull , moist eyes . She was a leader whose only concern was the survival of a great civilization that had turned to her to save them . <newline> <newline> `` No . '' My reply was deliberately cold and succinct . Her eyes shifted from a point , to the abyss as dread quickly glazed her face . I felt I should have continued , but I remained silent , like a wall . <newline> <newline> `` Why not ? You saved Guarthien ... and Jeautaw Number Eight ... and even ... even Aeris ! '' Her jawline quivered in uncontrollable anger , the kind of anger only injustice or betrayal can induce . `` Why will you not aid us in our time of need ! ? '' She seemed as though she would continue in her rant , but her voice settled in her pause . She spoke , barely above a whisper , which only served to deepen the rage . `` We have always defended you . The Council sought to exterminate you . They did not respect you ; they feared you ! Well ... now , The Council is gone ! '' She was shouting now . `` And here we stand , asking for your aid . Sisueron will destroy us as we are ; will you look upon our helpless planet and let us die ? '' The last word trembled as she spoke it . <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' I do not know whether or not she was more offended or shocked by my response . I did not care . <newline> <newline> A single tear rolled down her jagged , dark brown cheek . Her nearly imperceptible gills flared as a deep and long breath trembled through her . `` Why ? '' <newline> <newline> I held up a sleek , black remote . She stared , awestruck . As I tucked it back away in my pocket , she uttered , `` You found it ... But how ? '' The voice trailed off , not expecting an answer . Nonetheless , she continued , mostly thinking aloud to make sense of that small , sleek remote . `` You would n't use it , would you ? You 've always helped the helpless , defended the defenseless , saved the ... '' her voice trailed off , slowly consumed by tears ... `` Fuck you ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Sisueron made the better offer . '' I knew my explanation would not make her feel better . It would n't prevent the destruction of her civilization ... everything she fought for . Instead , it was curt and comfortless . I attempted to offer even a brief reprieve of comfort . `` Do n't worry , Sisueron is next . '' I tried not to smile as I pressed the center green button .

0,"`` The Savage within… '' those three words seem to have more impact than the existence of the creature that said them . Each of the leaders of the UN heard the celestial beings that addressed them 4 hours ago , they heard that the highly evolved aliens were in dire need . They all heard , in their native language , that the Calgifry ( at least that is what the name is in English ) were being eradicated by the Froxpok . And they understood from that 2 hour speech that the Froxpok were a militant race of elephant like creatures once a ally of the Calgifry , trading in knowledge and technology , until they had obtained the secrete of faster than light travel . Then they became concurrers . <newline> <newline> All of this seems to be little more than hackeyed plot to some science fiction mag , but here they are the Calgifry , the Froxpok and a simple side comment made when the Russian delegate ask `` Why Us ? '' And the Calgifry 's answer with quick and full of judgment `` Because you still retain your savage within , there are no other races in this galaxy that has to capacity to be more ruthless , more cruel , more savage than you humans… '' The Calgifrian said more , but what was said was lost at this point . This race that had at one point possessed over a thousand star-systems in there empire was calling us ruthless . This Xic'Pach from Calgify who had seen 90 % of his family slaughtered by Froxpok stormtroopers was had said that we humans were the most cruel race . They have come to use , not as benevolent gifters but to make a deal with the Devil , and we are the Devil in this pact ! <newline> <newline> Now we have to make a decision . Do we take this `` gift '' , to open up the starts for us to explore ? Knowing that it means going to war first , putting all of the human race into this galaxy wide genocide that is the war between these two power houses of the cosmos . It is almost like we would be painting a giant target on us , saying come here and slaughter us . Or do we turn it down , and let the Calgifry die . Knowing that the Froxpok probably know that they Calgifry can to us for aid . Thus painting that target on us anyway . <newline> <newline> I am the president of the United States , the leader of the Savages ' free world . And I have been put into this position to decide to take this offer , and let lose my savage , ruthless and cruel dogs of war onto an unsuspecting galaxy ; or do I turn down the offer thus proving to the galaxy that humans are savage , ruthless and cruel . <newline>

0,"Doh'tlec reviewed his message . It did n't need to contain much , just a few coordinates and a few words about what would be there . But the message was more than that . After the information was a story . The story contained all of the events of his life . From his first memory of coming out of his regeneration cell , to the invasion of his home planet only a few hours ago . All of his memories from his education , all of the times he met with his family , every idea he had shared were written down on the screen <newline> <newline> He also included all of the evil he had seen . Doh'tlec told of his mistakes . His failures . His regrets . He told everything , seeing himself in a way that only someone about to die can see . And finally , he told of the history . The Kreef , with their predatory nature . How they discovered the ability to travel the stars , and all of the prey they found there . He told of the war , how the Kreef never lost and never retreated . He told how they had reached the ends of the galaxy , killing all in their way . And he told of how they were forced back . <newline> <newline> Doh'tlec was one of the first to meet with the humans . They seemed even more vicious than the Kreef , but the humans had been willing to talk . He needed the help of humanity , but they demanded a price . Doh'tlec agreed to show them star travel . They had no idea how close they were to reaching it on their own , but they took the deal . And from that day , the Kreef never won a battle with the humans . The humans discovered the Kreef 's weakness , and turned the tide almost instantly . He told how the Kreef were almost completely destroyed . <newline> <newline> Doh'tlec heard thumping coming from outside his door , and knew his time was up . He sent the transmission , to be received by everyone with an Ansible . He heard the telltale beeping from his door . They loved to make their weapons beep . Doh'tlec raised his knife to his neck . They would not torture him . They would not take him alive to be made a toy . He cut , and his world exploded . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Above the planet 's surface , a terminal beeped . After a few moments , orders were growled , and the starship prepared to turn back for the first time . The terminal was wiped , but the message reappeared . `` We were wrong .

We needed some kind of hero , a fighter fresher then us . <newline> <newline> We first heard their songs in radio some time 52 years prior . Strange sounds , but we eventually understood their meanings and demeanings .

But I think we understand the problem . You and your enemy , you 're both pretty much the same . You 're both what we call `` clanking replicators '' , machines that can make machines . The `` enemy '' are industrial models designed primarily to manufacture more machines , and your sort seem to be more ... linguistic in nature . Comedians , specifically . And , while we mean no offense to you , we 're fairly certain you 're rather bad at it . Our industries are poised to help , but they 'll take a few years to build an appropriate fleet . In the meanwhile , we 've prepared a professional team to help improve your jokes .

0,"Not all humans were warriors . Not all of them invented machines and chemicals that brought death . This human was my friend . <newline> <newline> From the beginning , I knew that some humans were artists . Some built bridges and buildings . Some explored caves . We were told all about them by our scientists . The ones who studied other life forms on other planets . <newline> Still , most of us thought only of human warriors . Their bringers of death . At first , they were the most important part of humanity for us . We knew we needed human warriors to save us . And we knew that human warriors might eventually destroy us . We explored the problem for a long time . Then one of us suggested a solution . <newline> <newline> A young one suggested a way for us to have human aid without having to fear them . The plan seemed simple yet far fetched at the same time . We explored the possibilities for a long time . Then the best of us made a plan and all of us followed it . Now , such a short time later we were celebrating victory . After years of losing countless lives and many planets , we were celebrating the success of a far fetched idea , concocted by one of our youngest . <newline> <newline> I was happy for my species but I could not help but be sad for my friend , the human . She was puffed up with pride . We had been watching the celebrations together . My friend could not attend any of them in person . She had been born ill . Still she was proud of the accomplishment of her race . Her eyes were riveted to the display . As she watched the first member of the Congress of Worlds recount the victories , her lips moved as she mouthed his words . <newline> <newline> I could only watch my friend . I knew it was almost her time and I was happy that she lived to see this . My friend turned her head to look at me . It was the last time . She did n't see the dermal poison I placed on her arm . She closed her eyes and died painlessly without ever knowing what came next . <newline> <newline> The next day is when it happened . The final part of the plan . The first member of the Congress of Worlds spoke solemnly . He told my people that he knew it would be hard to say goodbye . I was not the only one with human friends . He thanked the humans . He told them that it was time for them to go . He nodded and the display ended . Every human dropped dead that instant . <newline> <newline> We are a peaceful people . We rationalized this part of the plan by saying they were only copies . We built a copy of earth and filled it with copies of all of Earth 's living things . The copies had no idea . The only thing different about them was a small biological kill switch embedded into their brains . At the key moment , we put the danger back into the box . No need to give the original humans any technology or unleash them out into the galaxy . <newline> <newline> We disposed of the human copies . We destroyed the second Earth . We mourned . I am not the only one of my people who made friends with the artists , builders , and explorers of Our Earth . Sometimes when the sky is clear at night .

0,"The lights on Ambassador Tel ’ s suspension tank remained static for some time . Like the rest of his species , his- *it ’ s* - body was a tangled web of translucent strands like a jellyfish crossed with a ball of yarn . <newline> <newline> In their home waters , under that warm tropical sun , even a mild current had the strength to tear them in two . This was of course by necessity , forming a crucial part of their reproductive cycle , but left them totally unfit for any sort of non-aquatic travel . <newline> <newline> So for one to undergo the invasive process of suspension , giving up months of their life to be cocooned in a steel tank filled with supportive , tear resistant gel had been my first clue to their desperation . On a hunch , I had pressed the issue and asked the Ambassador how their recent conflict had been proceeding . <newline> <newline> The indicator lights on the Ambassador ’ s tank stayed static for nearly fifteen minutes . I was almost to the point of calling one of their aids to check the translation equipment when the lights began to flash and the Ambassador ’ s synthetic voice spoke . <newline> <newline> “ Ambassador Stewart , to put it simply , the war has been a catastrophic failure. ” <newline> <newline> I paused mid sip of my tea , then set the dish down . The directness surprised me , we were so often censored from extra solar affairs . <newline> <newline> “ Surely it ’ s not nearly as bad as that , ” I responded , “ You ’ re the largest of the local regional powers . You had the clout to keep us unmolested since we were still building mud huts ! ” <newline> <newline> The lights flashed , “ No longer , our control has shrunk to less than one hundred cubic light years . All that remains are the Home Waters , several extrasolar depots , and you. ” <newline> <newline> I felt alarm . A feeling I had not had in a long time . <newline> <newline> The lights flashed again , “ Before you respond , let me ask you something. ” <newline> <newline> “ Of course. ” <newline> <newline> “ Why do you think we only sponsored your colony on Alpha , as opposed to just giving you the tensor shift mechanism out right ? ” <newline> <newline> The tangent caught be by surprise . I was still hung up on the thought of what type of enemy could conquer thousands of star systems in a few years time . <newline> <newline> “ When you contacted us , for the first time that is , you said it was imperative that we maintain our own path of technological development , that if we just borrowed , copied , or stole from others we would just blunt our own ability to innovate. ” <newline> <newline> The tanks lights lit up in a combination that indicated humor , “ We lied. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re brutal , short sighted , and violent and we wanted you controlled and suppressed so you didn ’ t burn across the galaxy like a cancer. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh , ” was all that came out from between the surprise and shock . <newline> <newline> “ We ’ ve watched you for thousands of years and never once have you come anywhere near what the civilized species of this spiral arm call peace . Even now your General Adi in the South Pacific is butchering his people , and that ’ s only the most prolific instance of similar acts of brutality across your planet . Even your most ‘ civilized ’ countries wage war every other decade ! ” <newline> <newline> My diplomatic training roared back to the forefront of my mind , “ Ambassador , these condemnations represent a serious shift in tone from our previous meetings . While I respect that we have cultural differences- ” <newline> <newline> “ It does not matter , ” the Ambassador ’ s synthetic voice interrupted , ” I ’ m here to give you the tensor shift mechanism. ” <newline> <newline> Confused , and with the beginnings of anger at these shifts in the conversation , I coldly asked , “ Why ? ” <newline> <newline> A pause before the lights flashed again , “ Because our war is about to become your war . We ask this of you .

0,"The Cycrian ambassador looked with trepidation at the conference room . In the center , on a large table , lay one of their warp drives . Around it were banks of computer screens , showing technical specifications and operation instructions in a dozen Terran languages . Surrounding that were several of what General Williams , the ambassador 's military liaison , called `` lab boys '' . The Cycrian glanced with trepidation at the General as one of the white-robed humans guesstured his companions over with a shout of `` ¡Miran ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure you are going to be able to assist us ? '' He said . The alien syllables still sounded strange on his lips . <newline> <newline> `` Ambassador , I can assure you , apart from one wheelchair-bound gentleman who refused to participate , what you see before you are some of the most brilliant minds on this planet . If anyone can figure out how we can help you— '' <newline> <newline> `` Amazing ! '' The General was cut off by a shout from one of the scientists . `` This configuration is what separates inertia from mass . '' <newline> <newline> `` I did n't think that was possible ... '' <newline> <newline> `` No , she 's right . Look there , the way the exotic particles are flowing through it . '' <newline> <newline> There was a string of Japanese from a man who , it looked to the ambassador , appeared to be squinting . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , that might work . '' There were a few taps on a keyboard , and the device began to reconfigure onscreen . `` Yeah , look at that , Takeshi . We should be able to control the shape of the inertial field . '' <newline> <newline> `` Can you try to thin the field out ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Something like this ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , but a little more . Little more ... '' <newline> <newline> `` What exactly do you have in mind ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm wondering what would happen if we stuck one of the United States ' prototype railguns in that field , and fired it off . What kind of speed would that kick that projectile to ? '' <newline> <newline> `` That 'd deliver quite the kick , alright ... '' <newline> <newline> An angry burst of Japanese . <newline> <newline> `` Of course I have n't forgotten Newton . That 's why we confine the field to the inside of the barrel . '' <newline> <newline> The woman at the terminal leaned back and pondered this for a minute . Others pulled out tablets and started running calculations on forces , speeds , and energies . Some of them were scratching their heads over conservation of energies , but all of them were pondering the potential of a weapon that had n't even existed minutes before . <newline> <newline> The General looked at the Ambassador . He was stock still . A slight ripple started at the Ambassador 's head , and went down to the floor . The General patted the Ambassador on what passed for the alien 's shoulder . `` I think you 're in good hands . '' <newline> <newline> Hours later , the Ambassador was sitting with his companions . He had n't spoken , but whispers of what the white-robed humans were working on slowly reached the delegation . <newline> <newline> `` *What have we done ? * '' he asked his companions . `` *What have we unleashed ? * '' <newline> <newline> With a somber look , one of them replied `` *I believe a human , a Doctor Leonard Church , put it best ... 'When faced with extinction , any alternative is preferable'* ''

0,"I bowed my head and looked at my hands . I fiddled with my fingers . I heard my companion lean back in her chair . <newline> <newline> `` That is an ... interesting request . '' <newline> <newline> I looked back up . She had one leg crossed over the other , one arm draped over the back of the chair . The thumb on her hand not clutching the chair was between her teeth . <newline> <newline> Considering what I 'd just asked her to do , she was hideously casual . She looked like she was mulling over what she wanted for dinner . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll talk to my superiors . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Every one of our councilmen had gathered , plus one human . We watched out windows and on displays as our enemies approached , their ships painted with bright streaks and images of death . We blanched . Our human companion sipped her drink . A tiny smirk crossed her face . <newline> <newline> `` They have no idea what they 've done . '' <newline> <newline> Our city was perfectly still , pale buildings reaching upwards higher than any human building . It looked dead already . We looked beaten . They did n't stop . <newline> <newline> `` Open fire . '' <newline> <newline> The order was icy cold . Everything they did was cool and calculated and cunning . <newline> <newline> *crack* <newline> <newline> The first tremendous slug from their ships came from above . It slammed into the flagship at over 60,000 kilometres per hour . She collapsed inwards , towards the hole torn through her hull . And then she fell , slow and burning , from the sky . I heard later she landed in a shallow lake in the middle of a public park . <newline> <newline> We heard the sound of the slug hitting our pavements , followed by the flagship hitting the ground . <newline> <newline> *crack , crack , crack* <newline> <newline> The slugs no longer made individual noises . So many were fired at once , it was like a hailstorm . <newline> <newline> Ships fell . The few troops who landed alive were torn apart by humans who willingly threw themselves from their ships with nothing but a small propulsion jet to slow their descent . The fleet our enemies had sent was destroyed utterly in less than 40 seconds . <newline> <newline> The human in the chamber sipped her drink again . <newline> <newline> `` That 's it ? I guess we got them by surprise . '' Everyone else was silent . <newline> <newline> <newline> World after world fell , and we reclaimed them . The humans had no interest in taking our cities for themselves . They slaughtered the enemy , gave the all-clear , and left . Every time , without fail . They took back all our worlds , but by that point , it was n't just pest control anymore . It was *their* war now . They pushed to worlds that were n't ours or anyone else 's to reclaim . They expanded their territory right around ours . What had once been a defence force was now a full-blown invasion . They chased and chased . Cold and calculated . Circling , striking , taking what they wanted and destroying everything else . The homeworld was nearly reached before we 'd even begun to recover . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Call them back . '' His huge eyes bulged out of his bowed head as he kneeled before us . `` Call the humans back . You 've taken what 's yours . '' The council talked among themselves . <newline> <newline> `` The humans ... are acting of their own accord . There is nothing we can do for you . '' <newline> <newline> * '' We have made a terrible mistake . `` *

0,"`` Chancellor Ehrbane , please , I am not a violent man . '' <newline> <newline> `` *Not a violent man ? ! * '' I spluttered with almost unkept rage , `` Your people have laid waste to my kin-kingdom 's homeworld . Your men have trodden armoured through the Basilica of Old Truths , the keystone of our culture ! Your weapons have destroyed our ancient reliquaries , devastated cities , and erased the history of our forebears ! You are callous , you are dishonourable , and you are most *certainly* violent ! '' <newline> <newline> The human in front of me cocked his head in confusion like some kind of pack animal , and quietly chuckled to himself before responding . <newline> `` No , Chancellor Ehrbane , I am not a violent man . I am a diplomat , an addition to your entourage , to cross the gap between your wishes and my superiors . My people are fighting a war on your behalf because you could not keep your next-door-neighbours off of your homeworld , and that Basilica was razed to ruin before humanity made planetfall . Those men you accuse me of destroying your world are not mine to command . '' <newline> <newline> I could not believe what this man was saying ; I was a Chancellor , a leader of the most sophisticated , proud and fashionable spacefaring civilisation in the spiral arm ! How could he bear to stand in my presence without being some kind of mighty leader himself ? <newline> `` Not ... yours to command ? '' I spoke , somewhat uneasily given the revelation of this being 's inferior status . The step backwards I took was instinctive ; I could stay too close to an inferior species , especially a specimen of lower class . <newline> <newline> The human quite obviously saw my actions and recognised my sense of distaste , sighing as if dealing with a child . `` That would be so , Chancellor Ehrbane , not mine to command . My superiors , on the other hand , do command those men , and believe me on this one ; '' he took a long step closer to me and leaned in as he did so , becoming nauseatingly close to my person , `` my superiors are *very violent men indeed* . '' <newline> <newline> To seemingly illustrate his point , another human warship blinked out of slipspace within my homeworld 's atmosphere , dangerously so given its vast size , mere miles from the tower I and the lesser human occupied . The gravitational distortion was immediately evident ; I could see the seas to the east begin to churn uncontrollably ; the earth shook and the sprawling buildings of my serfs below , structures far shoddier than my adamantium spire , began to tumble . The ventral guns of the warship opened up mere minutes later , tearing great holes miles wide into the flesh of my planet and decimating the routing mobs of invaders who , mere weeks earlier , had landed upon my home in grand armies , in serried ranks and with fluttering banners . Despite myself , I wept openly , and screamed aloud at the travesties committed by humanity upon my world . I sank to my knees , overcome with incalculable sorrow , my legs unable to keep me stable given the shaking of the ground beneath me and my emotional state . <newline> <newline> The human rocked gently from side to side , moving his centre of mass in time with the swaying of my tower to compensate for the shaking earth . He leant over again and whispered next to my shuddering , curled and embryonic form . <newline> <newline> `` I am not a violent man , Ehrbane , and neither are you . However , I and my people are strong , your people , and you in particular , are *weak* . We tore our world apart so that we could get our hands upon the slipspace technology *you* offered . Your honeyed words spawned revolution , civil war and despair upon my home . Your world will be torn apart in recompense . '' <newline> <newline> I still lay upon the ground , crying and yelling , as the human got up , sighed again , and began to walk for the staircase , he called over his shoulder as he retired . <newline> <newline> `` You brought pain to Earth , Ehrbane . You begged my people to rescue you from the invaders , but you did not beg to be rescued from us . Enjoy your world while it lasts , I know my superiors will . This is just the beginning , *the galaxy awaits humanity* ! ''

0,"*Humans . So , it 's come to this . We 're going to reveal ourselves and beg for help . From humans . * <newline> <newline> We 've exhausted all other options . No one else can help . The singularity snare defenses are n't enough against the bombardments with asteroids and comets , the bio-weapons , the gamma burst nukes , the planetary core iron refusion or the astral quantum inhibitors - the Alerrawia have damned near eliminated us from existence . We 've only managed to slow the marauders , not stop them . <newline> <newline> *We can always pick up the pieces and rebuild . * <newline> <newline> Then they 'll come at us again . Everything seems to just piss the Alerrawia off , making them more determined . Oh - by the way - Who else has that quality ? That 's right - the humans . <newline> <newline> *I do n't like it . Almost half the Consolidation council does n't like the idea either . And what about The Law ? * <newline> <newline> FUCK THE LAW ! What good will it do us if we 're all dead ? <newline> <newline> *Principles , remember ? Non-interference with savages ? Do n't give toys to subluminals ? * <newline> <newline> Screw principles , too . Survival is the ultimate rule in the universe . Humans get it . We 've forgotten it , to our peril . <newline> <newline> *The humans do n't look like they 're doing all too well on their own . They 've been on the precipice of annihilating themselves for the past 3 minutes . That 's the other thing : They do n't live long enough to be of any benefit to us . They live 5 minutes on average , 7 tops . The Alerrawia live 100,000,000 times longer . * <newline> <newline> True . But we can help humans live longer , at least twice or three times so . We can use our own as well as the Alerrawia technologies to enhance the poor frail things . They breed quickly , and more numerously over a lifetime than either we or the Alerrawia , so we can look forward to an exponential population increase over the next quarter year . By fall they 'll outnumber us , and by mid-winter they 'll outnumber the Alerrawia . <newline> <newline> *Numbers alone are n't the answer . * <newline> <newline> With humans , it makes all the difference . Look at what they 've done in the last 15 minutes : They 've grown from a bunch of pitiful fractured societies constantly at war , frequently at risk of mass starvation or disease and unable to travel around the planet in a lifetime ; to a nearly unified and largely peaceful global where 1 % travel the planet at will for leisure , and 25 % of them talk or listen to others on far sides of the planet daily . They could n't have done that before increasing their numbers into the low billions . Imagine what they 'll do in a week . <newline> <newline> *So you 're OK with over one hundred tredecillion humans in the next year ? * <newline> <newline> Not just OK with it . We need them . There is n't another savage race even remotely close to entry into the Consolidation , much less ready and able to fight the Alerrawia . We can keep twiddling our genetics with small additions or subtractions , but humanity offers us - as we them - a new frontier in our evolution . One the Alerrawia twisted against us . <newline> <newline> *Why should we trust the humans ? The Alerrawia were much better candidates . They had a hive mind willing to be integrated by us , and when we did they turned vicious . The humans have similar traits when they work in packs . * <newline> <newline> But humans have a self-limiter with their packs . They can only grow to 2^27th power before fragmenting . Even in much smaller packs , say 2^17th or 2^3rd , they can fragment . And humans can belong to multiple packs simultaneously ! Even ones which are diametrically opposed . Their customs encourage this kind of craziness . Nobody else does this on a scale anywhere close to humans . <newline> <newline> *Well , we 're finally at Earth . Time 's wasting . At least we get to enjoy some dilation while we talk to these beings . * <newline> <newline> Good morning , Humans . My name is Cheilith , and this is Seiliu . This is the final chance to back out ... <newline> <newline>

0,"*Crack ! * <newline> <newline> The lightwhip descended again , and again . The air reeking of burnt flesh , they stared as *it* was driven once more to the ground .

'' <newline> <newline> *Crack ! * <newline> <newline> `` This is what they asked of us ! '' <newline> <newline> *Crack ! * <newline> <newline> `` THIS IS THEIR PENANCE ! '' <newline> <newline> With one last strike , it was done . Not a single man looked away from the monsters compound eyes as it fell to the cold steel floor , devoid of life and soul , their pity and their mercy . <newline> <newline> 10 long years , humanity had to struggle after those alien assholes brought their war to our world . Promises of weapons , technology , enlightenment , all **bullshit . ** If any of those Politicians had half a brain , they would have told the so called `` Mighty Allegiance '' exactly where to stick it . <newline> <newline> Cannon fodder is n't a new tactic , but you 'd think we would be able to recognize it when we saw it . Our life spans , so much shorter than those of any other life form , made us ideal infantry . With a little modification , our rate of growth was boosted , our strength multiplied , our minds made sharp . In the millions , we could take a planet in months . In the billions , entire star systems were falling . In the trillions , the Allegiance realized it had made a fatal error . Lucky for us , it was far too late . <newline> <newline> The Commander knows better . A soldier knows better . Human 's have a good run of it , now that we 're running the show . An amazing run of it . We 've only got two more races of sentients left to go , after all . After that , we 'll be the only ones left . No one to bother us , to get us involved in their petty battles . <newline> <newline> The Commander , one boot pushed through the skull of the Anilaghon , began to lead us through the Anthem of Humanity . <newline> <newline> `` We are the masters of **War** . Through war , we will master **Life** . Through life , we will master **Ourselves** . Through Ourselves , we will master the Universe . Go forth , and assure peace through bloodshed . '' <newline> <newline> The men cheered , adrenaline surging through the unit like a lightning strike . Veins popped , muscled bulged , blood vessels burst . They were ready , they were always ready for *this* . The drop hatch began to open , and the faint whine of the soldiers Reactor Armor coming online could barely be heard over the howling wind , and blowing snow . <newline> <newline> The Commander spoke again . `` Two more planets to go , ladies and gents . Two more god damned races to send back to their pathetic creators ! And what 's the saddest part about that shit ? !

'' <newline> <newline> With that , 50 men jumped out of the ship , and joined the countless others falling towards the planet . A brutal cloud of death , descending toward the Anilaghon homeworld . There would be no escape . There would would be no hope for this species . <newline> <newline> They wanted to get us involved . We are going to make damn sure that Humanity never gets used again . <newline> <newline> The Commander hit the ground first , as always . The Argonauts crashed down like fallen angels around him , the impacts fusing sand into glass , smoke rising with the soldiers as they continued Humanity 's final crusade . <newline> <newline> The Commander , as always , took a moment to look upon this world , and think the same thing he always did when the screams began . <newline> <newline> `` This is what they wanted ...

0,"After years of galactic isolation , the cosmic caps were lifted from the human defined cluster . It was a simple principle , illusory light and gravitational signals that made the humans primitive light detecting instruments useless , a simple screen that kept the humans oblivious to the rest of the life in the Local Cluster . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was not done out of a sense of elitism . The Local Union accommodated all sentient life , even the dim-witted Oppon . <newline> <newline> <newline> When the humans were first discovered , and their behavior studied , we found them to be an astonishing anomaly from all other life in the Local Cluster . We had met many savage life forms , and many sentient ones , but none that were both . Indeed , the humans possessed basic empathy and sentience that separated them from the rest of the life on Earth , but they also possessed an incredible capacity for rationalization and mental gymnastics that allowed them to do the horrific things they did not only to the other life on their planet , but to themselves . Due to this capacity for savagery and evil , they were classified as Type 4 Life . They could rationalize their animal and savage behavior all they wanted , but the end result was the same as any other Type 4 Life form : violence , cruelty , and evil . <newline> <newline> <newline> An Earth Tiger is a beautiful thing , and can be petted one day , it can be perfectly civil for years , lifetimes , it can be taught tricks . But this does not mean that they are not a savage , unpredictable animal that can turn on its owner and tear it to pieces on a whim . Thus , this was the school of thought regarding the isolation of the humans . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> But then the Belnhi came . They annihilated us . They were a savage race , incapable of empathy . Animals with superior bodies , and superior technology , they broke the Local Cluster within a single Earth Year . They razed and plundered , and committed genocide casually on all planets . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The humans were not even our final idea . They were just a desperate attempt to recruit any and all life forms . The humans were destroyed in battle the same as any other at first , but they adapted so quickly . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> They took the rifles from our hands , they appropriated not only our technology , but the Belnhi 's . And met with the savagery of the Belnhi , they responded in the same fashion . They made our old planets nigh unlivable with new nuclear weapons they did not hesitate to fashion by synthesizing human , LU , and Belhni technology . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> We could not speak out against the genocide the humans committed against the Belnhi . For the slaughters the Belnhi inflicted on the humans , the humans did much worse . They tortured them for sport and entertainment for many years before celebrating a massive genocide of all remaining Belnhi . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> By that time , the LU Military was really the Human Military , with LU slaves for cannon fodder . They were never overt with the discrimination and oppression of all other life forms , they justified it , they hid it , they denied it while it was happening right in front of them , but soon the humans occupied all positions of power , and our planet became another colony , a planet and people to be raped of their resources . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> But there was always a bigger fish . When the Slalamesh came out of the darkness beyond the Local Cluster , they were similarly repulsed by the humans behavior . But they did not take the academic and soft approach that we took . The pragmatic Slalamesh valued life for its genetic diversity above all else , and called the human genocide of the Belnhi and others a `` galactic sin '' . As punishment , they killed 99.99 % of all the humans , reducing a species of 16 trillion to 2 million of varying genetic diversity . The ones that remained were kept on the Slalamesh Ultrazoo for scientific study or allowed to exist on Earth watched over a by a Slalamesh Supervisor in small communes , never to return to their great cities . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> And that was the short and violent history of humanity .

0,"A eon we watched them . We watched them kill each other with amazement . Their violence horrified us , but we saw glimpses of peace amid the blackness of horror . Deep inside , their intentions were good , every single one of them acted on the idea that what they were doing was improving the situation of another . We watched as endless wars raged , wondering when they would make the space-travel breakthrough that would unleash them upon the rest of the galaxy . But they did not , instead they invented terrible weapons to inflict even greater violence on others in the hope of bettering their lives . So we hid them , we hid their entire system from the galaxy and they remained hidden , but now before us , we had a choice . We could knowingly unleash them on the galaxy , or we could perish . <newline> <newline> <newline> The galactic civilizations fought a good fight , but the Hastari were too powerful , too numerous , too violent . Many generations ago , the Hastari were like the humans , considered too dangerous for the galaxy , but before the galaxy could react , they burst forth from their asteroid belt homeworld . They consumed resources at a rate never seen before . The Galactic Congress was helpless to stop their onslaught . They devoured planets in a matter of generations , growing exponentially , gaining technological experience and resources at each stop . In just a short time , the Hastari had decimated the congress to just a few backwater civilizations , and us , the hiders . Even the great Dertahs , with their armada of war ships was no match for the Hastari . <newline> <newline> <newline> We did nothing , we hid , because that is our nature , we are the galaxies hiders . We hid the humans long ago , and instead of fighting when the hastari found us , we scurried off to another part , hiding in the shadows of black holes , pulsars , whatever we could find . The Hastari ships would always find us , and we were sick of hiding . We could not fight , but we knew who could . Our council gathered and chose me to come out of hiding . I was to seek out the humans and set them free . The Hastari did not have good intentions they argued ; they had consumptive intentions . They simply wanted to expand , at the cost of the rest of the galaxy . I did not argue because I was and still am afraid , I was afraid of the Hastari because they would consume us , all of us and all that would remain are stories , but I am more afraid of the humans , because they will kill , and they will feel righteous in their killing . <newline> <newline> <newline> I set them free ten years ago . Today I walk a free entity . I no longer hide . The Hastari were defeated in one earth year . The galaxy was amazed as this new species rose to our aide . The Hastari were stopped in their advance , and then they were pushed back , in battle after battle they were defeated by the humans , until finally they were forced to retreat to their homeworld . The galaxy was in awe , which evolved to terror as the humans did not stop with the Hastari defeat . The humans insisted that the Hastari would expand once again if left to their own devices , and they invaded the Hastari home planet . They massacred the entire species , leaving only scattered survivors . Then they turned to the rest of the galaxy , told us that they came in peace , and held out their hands , the same hands that had just completely annihilated the greatest threat civilization ever faced , with ease . They smiled and moved into the Hastari homeworld , not content to destroy the Hastari people , but they insisted on building over their history , erasing them , all while smiling and reminding us of their peaceful intentions . I ’ m told they have a saying on earth : “ They make a desert and call it peace ” . Once I thought that was just a story , but today I know it ’ s true . Today I no longer hide , but sometimes I wonder if I should . <newline> <newline>

0,"May our children forgive us ; for we choose servitude over annihilation . Is it not better to be second among equals , lower only to them and above the rest ? Is it not better to watch the fleet of those who would enslave you burn , to watch their planets fall and their cities crumble than to see your people massacred , your holy places desecrated , your world die . We may be giving up our freedom but at least we will survive right ? Yes , we will lose our beloved council , we will see Kartaloon fill will races from around the Dominion , we will cede territory to others and be forced to do trade with lesser species but we will survive . My brothers and sisters do you not wish to see the Targracians suffer for all that they have done to us , for what they did to the outer colonies for Impac , Tonar and Harkathia how many billions of us have they extinguished how many worlds have they made dim . Only the scourge of the Humans of the Dominion of Canada can lay restitution for the sins and atrocities that they have befallen upon us . <newline> <newline> The Humans will be our ultimate weapon against Targracia , her people will weep for a million cycles , her Gods will be made to bow before the shadows and their hand , the Humans , her cities will empty and their people will know what it truly means to suffer , to suffer without hope , without mercy , to suffer at the hands of humans . Remember your history what they did to their own kind the atrocities committed against the cities of New York , Sao Paolo , Beijing , Tokyo now imagine what they would do to the Targracians a species that may pose a threat to them , even if only an imagined one . Yes my brothers and sisters we may lose autonomy but how many are truly left free in this galaxy if we do not capitulate to the Humans than to who ? Should we be as the Par Madi a dead race only to be remembered in the annals of history ; a lesson for those to come the consequences of those to prideful to bend to those more powerful than themselves , is it not better to bend to the Devil we know than the one we do n't ? <newline> <newline> By joining the Canadian Dominion we will be given access to technologies millenia beyond our current level we will have access to their space-time gateways , our children will see parts of the galaxy that our grandfathers could only dream of . We will be able to spread far and wide to the point that even if Kartaloon should fall our people never will . As second among equals we will never know subjugation of a conquered people , only Humans themselves will be above us , and in the vastness of their territories we will barely even notice them , true our illustrious council will be disbanded and our people will be subjected to their `` Democracy '' but they will also be protected by their `` Charter of rights and freedoms '' . We will be given technology to build a fleet of star ships that would be able to explore the Galaxy and protect our people , and still be backed up by the Canadian Star Fleet , we will be given voice in the Galactic Council , I have seen it myself their base inside of Sol , the base inside the heart of their sun where the representatives of the second species work together , where the Therelians and the Ic Ba Moor once bitter rivals exist together in peace . <newline> <newline> Truth be told we have little choice in the matter , capitulation to the Humans is the only choice we have . I stand before you not to ask for your acceptance in this matter but to ask for your forgiveness for the deal has been made , by this time tomorrow the siege will be over , within an hour the full Canadian armed forces will enter Kartaloonian space and engage in battle with the Targracians . A Governor class space station will orbit between us and our third moon Today is the last day that Kartaloon exists as a free and independent world , but we still have a tomorrow and for that I will not apologize .

0,"I leaned back in my chair as we neared Planet Delta , otherwise known as a random series of numbers that I could n't be arsed to remember . The fourth planet to be taken back . <newline> <newline> The alien standing in front of my squad briefed us . His -- No , wait , *its* skin a slightly translucent gray , his face a little bit like a tadpole . Little antenna things sticking out of his head , bit weird that , big round eyes . Definitely not how I imagined aliens . <newline> <newline> He was babbling on about minimizing civilian casualties , preserve the buildings , blah , blah , blah . We already knew all that . I looked around at my brothers and sisters in this ship , the ones who I 'd trained with for ten years prior , perfecting the art of war . <newline> <newline> I heard something about us about to head in , and I prepared my assault rifle , as did the others . Nice advantage to humans , that . The bullets tear straight through those alien shields ; the bullets just do n't go fast enough . <newline> <newline> The alien sat down , and our leader stood up . `` We 're about to deploy into the capital city of the planet , '' he shouted . Did n't have to shout , it was n't that loud , but it was good practice . `` Be prepared for traps and ambushes from the buildings . '' <newline> <newline> Over the loud speaker , the alien pilot announced , `` 15 minutes . '' And so we waited , 15 minutes , guns cocked , ready to deploy . <newline> <newline> The ship was already getting shot at as we got closer to the ground . The shuttle bay opened , and we were immediately out . The energy pulses whizzed past me as I ran and ducked for cover . I tried to listen to my radio on my shoulder to get more information on what was going on . <newline> <newline> `` -- -lot of those -- - gone missing -- - all in the buildings . '' <newline> <newline> In the buildings was all the info I needed . I looked around to see who was around ; the entire squad was behind cover near me . Perfect . As they started firing over cover , trying not to get smacked with what were essentially massive balls of pure energy , I sprinted around and moved right on up toward a nearby building , where I saw there were plenty of hostiles inside . I heard several more squad mates near me , behind me , running with me . <newline> <newline> Straight inside we went , though the door was a bit unconventional in its oval shape . No more than five of us , busting down walls and doors , immediately spraying right through their shields . With a slight smirk , I knew that the others outside would take this opportunity to push up . Within minutes , the building was cleared , with barely a scratch . Tough as they were , they did n't realize how we waged war . <newline> <newline> As I walked past , going back down , I heard a faint moan . I looked around , tilted my head , and tried to find the source . Eventually , I traced it to a nearby dying alien . With a slight purr behind its voice , translated by the technology provided by the other aliens , it spoke . `` ... So ... Merciless ... No.. H-hesitation ... . '' <newline> <newline> It seemed like it was in pain , so with a quick burst , I put it out of its misery . I could n't help but feel some guilt for it . A sad smile , a backward glance as I left them behind . I knew from the briefing , though . They would 've shot back , but not before trying to force us to surrender . In that way , we were more brutal . We did n't hesitate ... but the guilt ate away at us . I 've seen a lot of friends who went that way . <newline> <newline> But , what mattered was that the job was finished . And we 'd do the same thing for the entire planet , and the planets next in line . <newline>

0,"`` Your Holiness , they can not be trusted ! '' Chancellor Vyx said with a raised voice , not daring to allow any menace or anger come through as he addressed his liege . `` *My dearest Vyx , do you not see ? There truly is no other way.* '' . Empress Yllant spoke into Vyx 's mind . `` I know my empress , I know ... but I fear that if the Gaunt are n't our downfall , then the humans will be once they 've wiped the Gaunt from our systems '' . <newline> <newline> Empress Yllant stood , softly swaying back and forth , her large eyes closed and her pale grey skin softly reflecting the myriad of lights illuminating the counsel chambers . It gave her a slightly blue hue , one that could only be overpowered by the colors of her deep and bright cerulean eyes . <newline> <newline> After a moment of thought , she mentally spoke again . `` *The humans are indeed a vicious and dreadful race . They war with one another over the worst of things : resources , religion , substance , power . That is why they are perfect for us . They 've spent the past 4 millenia at war . Perfecting and expanding on its art . Their greatest technological breakthroughs have almost exclusively had war as the primary use . But , they are also progressive in ways we do not understand . They are capable of ceasing their warring on a whim , and turning enemies into allies . They are capable of strong devotion and loyalty to one another , especially if the relationship is mutually beneficial . That , my dear Vyx , is why they will aid us . We will provide them with the ability to traverse the stars unimpeded , in exchange for their gifts of war . * '' <newline> <newline> `` My empress , if we give the humans the ability to travel as we do , where will they turn once they 've sucked the surrounding systems dry ? You and I both know their history on planet colonization . They barely reached the 4th planet of Sol , and it 's a barren wasteland . They had absolutely minimal success at colonizing it , and if you recall , ultimately had to abandon the notion all together . What will they do when they see Ortga , with its lush forest and waterways ? The pristine and abundant sources of oxygen ? Or what about Ghendo ? It has more precious metal and fuel sources than we can accurately catalog , and we 've been at that task for nearly 900 cycles . They will see what we have , they will take , and they will us it for further war . It 's what they do . However ... '' Vyx wiped rust colored sweat from his brow `` If you will it , it shall be done , in your most holy name . I have my concerns , my dreads ... . my fears ... but I will not question your judgement . I will dispatch envoys immediately . You are correct about all . '' Vyx turned to leave the counsel chambers as she invaded his mind once more . `` *Ensure that they are adequately enticed Vyx . The Gaunt are not like the humans after all . Even for humanity , they will provide a sporting challenge . Both sides will stand to lose much , with greater to gain if they win . * '' <newline> <newline> A smile crept up on Vyx 's thin black lips . `` Off course , your Holiness . It will simply be a matter of 'informing ' the humans that if we fall , the Gaunt will see the Sol system as their next target . They are always so eager to fight , they surely will not chance an invasion of Terra . '' <newline> <newline> `` *Vyx , are you planning to outright lie to them ? In my name no less ? * '' <newline> <newline> `` I will do what is necessary your Holiness , to ensure they cooperate in a manner you are pleased with '' . <newline> <newline> Empress Yllant opened her eyes and spoke aloud . `` You 're already thinking like one , Vyx . You serve me well '' .

0,"As I finished my report of another successful mission , the Admiral , nodded victoriously . “ Excellent work Lieutenant . Get your troupes some food and rest while you await further orders. ” Thank you Admiral , ” I replied as I stood to await my dismissal . No . I have to talk to him . The Admiral knew something was on my mind right away . He always did . “ Something else , Lieutenant ? ” he asked knowing the answer . <newline> <newline> “ Um , yes sir . If I may , I ’ d like to discuss the current objective with you. ” He looked up at me awaiting to here what I had to say . “ Alone. ” <newline> <newline> He looked up at me and seemed to finally fully grasp the heaviness I was carrying . As he put his cigar out in his ashtray , painted as an atlas to remind him of home , he dismissed the company . He stood up and poured two whiskeys . <newline> <newline> “ What ‘ s on your mind , son ? ” he asked handing me the second whiskey . <newline> <newline> “ Father , What are we doing , here ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Winning the war , ” he promptly replied . I knew I ’ d have to spell this out . <newline> <newline> “ I know that , but why ? It ’ s not our war. ” <newline> <newline> “ Of course it is , ” he said without missing a beat . “ We ’ re taking our place among the stars . “ <newline> <newline> “ As mercenaries ? ” <newline> <newline> “ As defense , ” ’ he replied sternly , “ The Rhondonians have been plaguing the Centaurians for years . The Centaurians were defenseless . Until now . It ’ s a noble cause Bill. ” <newline> <newline> He took a big sip as I stared at him in disbelief . Finally I spoke . <newline> <newline> “ You can ’ t believe that father . Noble ? I ’ m sorry but there are noble causes , and this is not one of them . We are not fighting for the preservation of our race . We ’ re not fighting for some altruistic ideal of protecting those weaker than us . We ’ re fighting for an FTL drive . Our war ? This ship ? It ’ s run on bloody money. ” <newline> I stared at him waiting for his reply . He stared back , searching me . <newline> <newline> “ What happened to you down there ” I didn ’ t reply . As he knew I wouldn ’ t . I believe he was asking himself . He pressed on , “ There ’ s an entire universe out here son . We may have been the most evolved on our planet but look at what they ’ ve built here . Intelligence is not our advantage anymore . Our will to fight is what we have-what they lack . We ’ re carving our race into the history the intergalactic world . This is what we have to offer . We will not stand on the sidelines. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> I stared at the man who raised me , in horror . No . Not horror . Disappointment . This is how deep his ideals went . Finally , I set my whiskey down and spoke . “ So its true. ” <newline> <newline> “ What ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You don ’ t mean to stop . This wasn ’ t just about the FTL drive . This whole war is an advertisement for the human enterprise : “ Earth : Mercenaries for Hire ” <newline> <newline> He seemed to lose the ability to look me in the eye , walking to a window overlooking the Centaurian home planet . “ I will not stand on the sidelines. ” <newline> <newline> “ And I will not fight someone else ’ s war .

0,"We 'd kept them locked up around Sol for over three centuries . Watching their civilization was like studying cancer through a microscope . First one planet colonized . Then two . Then four . Then eight . Growing , and growing , and growing , swarming over moons and through gas giants . Destroying everything in its path . Burning through resources as though tomorrow would never come . And killing its host : Earth itself had become a mined-out husk , and Mars was on its way to the same fate . <newline> <newline> Our strategy had been containment . Every probe and ship sent out was destroyed as soon as it emerged from the Oort cloud . We did n't like the idea , but it was better than humans overrunning every other peaceful system in the galaxy . We were doctors , stopping the cancer from infecting the rest of galaxy . Sometimes , though , it just felt like we were throwing rocks at a beehive . The number of probes continued to grow . Sol was a swollen tumor , ready to burst . And if they ever discovered who had really stopped those probes ... <newline> <newline> But that is all in the past . In the end , it turned out that the humans were the lesser of evils . The Kahi cut through us like a knife , seizing our homeworld in less than a year . Getting cancer does n't seem so bad when you 're already dying of stab wounds , right ? Hell , maybe it could even help . <newline> <newline> The humans seemed so shocked when we landed . After all those years of imagining what aliens were like in their movies , they had n't even come close to picturing it . I still remember the ship door opening to the sight of gun barrels . Typical humans . `` I come in peace , '' I 'd told them ( well , my computer did , at least ) , in perfect English . That 's what they would have wanted ; those movies sure are helpful . <newline> <newline> I presented my terms to the United Nations Congress . Technological aid , weapons , maps of the universe , and all sorts of other benefits . I even pointed them right to a great star system that they would love , full of arable land and fishable seas . Conveniently near the Kahi colonies ... <newline> <newline> Did they know they were being played ? Possibly . Maybe they just did n't care . They offered me and the remnants of my civilization shelter , living in their polar regions . Antarctica was the perfect climate for my people . And they did n't seem to like it very much anyway . It was just the right size for what remained of our species . <newline> <newline> When they encountered the Kahi , it was a bloodbath . Dozens of worlds lost at once . World leaders pounded their fists and demanded retribution . The great docks in orbit churned to life , pouring out starships like they were baking cookies . Even as I was revolted at the way they chewed through their own asteroid belt for resources , I was impressed at their resolve and determination . They asked if we knew of these Kahi ; we told them only barely . Just enough to tell them all about their technology and physiology ; everything they would need to carry on a war . Perhaps they will discover our lie when they find the ruins of our homeworld ; perhaps not . But they are not wrathful enough to massacre us because of a tiny lie . They 'll rant and they 'll rage , and maybe expel us from our new city in Antarctica . It wo n't really matter ; at least we 'll be able to go home . <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> By popular request , I wrote [ a second spinoff story from a human perspective but within the same story ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/2qgkjb/wed_kept_them_locked_up_around_sol_for_over_three/cn5ygqp ) .

0,"“ That ’ s the last of their blockade , Admiral Gainey . We are clear to push our troops to landing positions. ” <newline> <newline> “ Move forward . As soon as our dropships cross the atmosphere the operation is in General Adams ’ hands. ” The stern faced Admiral turned from the Lieutenant to look back out the bridge viewport . At the sprawling metropolis of a planet slowly rotating before them . <newline> <newline> “ Yes sir . I will send the orders through. ” <newline> <newline> Captain Baker stepped forward as the subordinate left . The usual signs of rank were made . “ That was it ? ” The question was directed at Admiral Gainey , still looking out at the targeted planet . His face an emotionless mask . “ These creatures have blown over dozens of Caragin colonies . We just wiped a blockade in less than an hour . Did we even lose anyone ? ” <newline> <newline> “ No. ” It was the only response given . The only one Baker could expect . In contrast to perfect regimental respect Baker continued , <newline> “ Always stoic with you . Can ’ t even revel in a victory as important as this one . We have declared ourselves the superior beings in the galaxy . If this invasion stays on track we can- “ <newline> <newline> “ Expand until we are weak ? ” The response caught Baker off guard . Any other Captain spoke as casually to the Admiral as Baker did and there would be an unusual use of the airlock , but he and the Admiral had a mutual respect . They had served together for years and had become close in that time . Well , as close as the Admiral grew to anyone . But there was a cutting tone of anger in this curt , taunt response . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry I didn ’ t think- “ <newline> <newline> “ No , you didn ’ t think . It doesn ’ t seem like anyone has. ” He finally turned his gaze away from the world before him to look at the Captain dead in the eye . “ This does not end well for us , it can ’ t. ” <newline> <newline> Baker was truly confused , “ How can this be a bad deal ? We get the FTL cores , and assert ourselves as dominant in the process . Whatever we want is ours for the taking . Hell , there ’ s barely any resistance left down there after the bombardment we sent down earlier , during a ship to ship battle none the less . We are hammering them at every turn. ” <newline> <newline> “ This war will stretch us . Farther than we can easily see , and farther than we are ready to go . What happens when the Caragin decide they don ’ t like us in their space anymore ? No way they will stay disarmed after this . Do you want to exterminate them too ? Pull out fleets from one side of the galaxy to another leaving whatever we settle alone and defenseless ? ” <newline> <newline> “ We will only expand as far as we can- “ <newline> <newline> “ No we want . We were asked for help for a reason . We are selfish , violent , and greedy . It is exactly what the Caragin need , and what will destroy us. ” The Admiral ’ s eyes showed more emotion than Baker had ever seen in them . Not the good kind of emotions either . An unholy mixture of passion and anger . “ This is the day that humanities fall starts . In glorious victory. ” With that the Admiral turned back to the world , ending the conversation . Baker turned to leave , stunned , when another Lieutenant came forward and saluted . <newline> <newline> “ Admiral , Captain , the first troop waves have landed and met great success ! General Adams is already declaring this a victory ! ” <newline> <newline> The works rang in Bakers head over and over , “ In glorious victory. ” <newline>

Anyone with a military and a stake was here , mulling over the proposition . <newline> <newline> The debate raged on , hours turning slowly into days , much like the weight of the situation . They said they were the most brutal enemies they ever faced , sparing no military installation . But they said we were worse , we could take them . History was filled with leaders doing far worse atrocities than what these yahoos do and we survived ourselves . They said the situation was dire , that their last world was coming under threat and they might not be able to hold off the coming forces even with our aid . But what do we do ? Humans fight hard and long , and nothing stands in our way . And think of the payoff . FTL technology ! We can get out of the Sol system ! <newline> <newline> Of course , that simply underscored the bigger problem , a growing sentiment among every one of the now 9 billion people living on this rock : It 's not enough . We 'd survived ourselves before but our lucky streak , we knew , was coming to an end . Earth was growing tired of us and we would n't be able to survive her wrath . We needed to move , and these other aliens seemed like a far preferable alternative . <newline> <newline> In the end , the only question asked was : Where are they ? <newline> *** <newline> `` Argus 32 , this is Fayen 14 , we 're in position for the final assault , over .

0,"I watched as the Malvox emperor , along with his six generals walked towards me and my alien translator . About 300 yards behind the emperor , were around a quarter of a million of his troops . They were a massive species , averaging around 8 feet in height . With their imposing armor , they kinda reminded me of anime mech fighters from a cartoon that I used to watch as a kid . <newline> <newline> The Malvox emperor and generals dismounted from their alien steeds and walked towards me . He assumed that since that I did n't bring an army with me , that I would be negotiating the Frollen nation 's terms for surrender ... he assumed wrong . <newline> <newline> Through my Frollen translator , I suggested that it would be in the emperor 's best interest to surrender instead . My translator nervously relayed my message . Unsurprisingly , the emperor and his generals began laughing loudly . <newline> <newline> My translator told me his response : <newline> <newline> `` Roughly translated sir , he said that he thinks that you humans must be insane or stupid . I think I 'll take your little world next just because of your insolence . '' <newline> <newline> I replied with : <newline> <newline> `` Emperor , you have no idea who you 're dealing with . The reason that I did n't bring an army with me is because I do n't need one . The Frollen informed me that you , along with all of the other sentient species in this quadrant have , `` rules of war '' that you guys have strictly followed for over 3,000 years . '' <newline> <newline> `` When they showed me footage of what those rules entailed , I literally had to sit down because I was laughing so hard . You guys literally choose a place and time to meet for a battle . What 's really crazy is that you declare ahead of time which side of the field that you would be fighting from . Emperor , even your style of fighting is quaint to me . You guys line up nice and orderly , and then take turns firing at each other with single-shot , musket-type laser weapons . It reminds me of an old war our ancestors had a couple hundred years ago . I 'm going to give you one more chance to surrender before I kill all of your troops and your generals . '' <newline> <newline> The emperor , was no longer laughing . He told me that in no uncertain terms was he surrendering . He also mentioned that he was going to enjoy watching his pets tear me from limb to limb after he crushes to Frollen homeworld . <newline> <newline> The emperor watched as I pulled out a small metallic cylinder from my left pocket . I flipped off the top and pressed the red button with my thumb . The emperor watched in horror as the battlefield that his troops were standing on uniformly exploded . He could n't comprehend what was happening . <newline> <newline> What the emperor could n't comprehend was that the day before , I had my demolition guys bury a thousand C4 charges on the side that he pre-chose to place his troops on . The emperor was also at a loss when I drew my glock from my holster and killed all six of his generals . <newline> <newline> `` H-h-how ? How is this possible ? ! ? ! My army ... my generals . How did you kill my generals without repriming your weapon after each shot ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's called a semi-automatic handgun . I could shoot your generals nine more times before reloading . Also , your army was destroyed with this little thing called explosives . I did n't even have to show up today . I could have pressed that detonator while eating my breakfast this morning but I wanted to see you eye to eye .

They always held themselves with grace , never letting you see behind their eyes . <newline> <newline> Especially Kivik . Michael had known her for near a decade . Kivik had a way of making a man feel at peace . That was not what was happening today . <newline> <newline> Kivik looked up .

Immediately . '' She said , her voice hardening with every word . <newline> <newline> `` You know you ca n't do that . The fact that you exist is still so classified that if anyone besides me or Saul saw you ... '' he trailed off . <newline> <newline> His words hung in the air between them . Her shaking stopped . <newline> <newline> `` There is no time for that now . Our , my , home planet was obliterated . There are but five of us left . We need your people 's help .

His heart was racing , and he could hear angry voices through the door . He had chewed his fingernail near off in the last two hours . <newline> <newline> Michael was about to break every rule in the book . The number one rule they had been taught since they were hired by the DoHS was to never mention what they did here . Not to their families . Hell they probably should n't even talk to each other . <newline> <newline> And yet . <newline> <newline> Michael was trying to convince Admiral Checkov in there to let the world know about Kivik and her people . <newline> <newline> The voices were getting louder . <newline> <newline> The door burst open and Michael came storming out .

Your car . Your house . Your wife . You know the people you 're about to piss off and- '' <newline> <newline> He was cut off when Michael spun round and got up in his face . <newline> <newline> `` And I do n't give a good goddamn . I will not just ... stand here while more and more species , our friends ! Our friends mind you get wiped out . '' <newline> <newline> Saul groaned . The other two seemed to finally notice he was there . Michael simmered down before throwing his hands in the air . <newline> <newline> `` Fuck it !

'' <newline> <newline> Paravid sat before the smooth white surface of the comlink , her head resting in her slender hands . Rising from the stone-like surface was the face of her soulmate , Famet . <newline> <newline> `` No .

'' <newline> <newline> `` It means you have willingly invited the enemy into your home . Paravid , you know my feelings about the -- <newline> <newline> `` -- enough Famet ! Your counsel is well received I assure you , but you speak as if we had a choice . We can allow this 'fox ' into our home , or we can allow the Mu'Razek into our home . Which would you prefer ? '' <newline> <newline> The Mu'Razek were cold , and exact , and terrible . They attacked with a precision that was clinical , their strikes like a scalpel removing vital organs in one clean cut . For a sunturn the Halirons had fought back , each time losing more ground , each time sacrificing more lives . It was enough . It was too much . <newline> <newline> The Queen daughter had made the decision to seek the help of Earth - a distant speck in a forgotten corner of the galaxy , its people barely emerged from the mud . At first Paravid could not grasp the Queen daughter 's logic . How could these primitive people possibly prevail against the Mu'Razek . <newline> <newline> Paravid took it upon herself to study the Earthlings . True , there was love , and passion , and kindness , but there was something else , too . She saw conflicts so terrible they ~~defined~~ **defied** explanation . Earthlings slaughtered their own with a mindless brutality . They invented machines with a single purpose – to cause immeasurable suffering . She learned of leaders who systematically exterminated millions based on the shade of their skin . Paravid did not realize such widespread death was possible . Not even the Mu ’ Razek could match their bloodlust… and then she understood . <newline> <newline> `` I would prefer peace '' Famet said softly , stirring Paravid from her thoughts . `` I would prefer a world where we can come home to each other . '' <newline> <newline> Paravid 's vision flashed back to her childhood . She and Famet were playing together under the triple-sun of Haliron , what the Earthlings called GG Tau A . Always the explorer , Paravid had defied her clan-mother 's warning and ventured onto the steppes west of her village . Even then Famet was the voice of reason , begging her to turn back , warning her of the punishment that awaited them both ... but he would not leave her side . <newline> <newline> When the shariat attacked it was Famet who defended her , fighting off the beast with nothing more than his sonostick . This was the first day Paravid realized what she felt ... she loved Famet . She needed him to balance her brash impulsiveness . Her whole life she had relied on Famet ’ s calming counterbalance , until today . <newline> <newline> `` You are looking with the wrong eyes Famet . Our options have been taken from us . '' Paravid gathered herself , rising up in her seat . `` Clan-mother had a saying , too . The distant hill is seen , but the mountain behind is hidden . We must turn and confront the challenge . You are my love , but I am also your commander . This decision is mine to make. ” <newline> <newline> Paravid waved her hand over the comlink and Faramet ’ s face faded from view wearing a wry smile . A second wave and the white comlink became transparent… opening the channel . <newline> <newline> “ People of Earth ” Paravid said calmly , “ we come in peace . ”

0,"The Recktonian race had ignored every single term in our treaty about the war carried and suffered by our youngsters . <newline> <newline> Their psychometry and technopathy were used against our starships and our nests , The One Queen was captured in her own lair short after those Recktonians showed off their recently acquired mind control and memory manipulation capabilities . <newline> <newline> The situation was tragic , our entire civilization was threatened by first time in thousands of cycles . The responsible : a inferior race , a psychic civilization who was able to hide their main capabilities from the senses of The Council . Nothing in them was looking extraordinary at the start , nothing was special about what we saw on them , our advanced technology , our empathy skills and our precognition abilities used for uncountable time to keep a complete peaceful status in every one of the civilizations we raised was more than enough to take care of their mind manipulation skills . Or at least that 's what we thought . <newline> <newline> We gave them the knowledge to the mass duplication , we taught them the molecular control and we instructed them in the education of the Big Thinker . But we could n't imagining anything about their technopathy abilities , it was just impossible to imagine . How could be it developed in a natural way ? <newline> <newline> In the moment they took control over our Nests we were already lost . We , the oldest civilization in this galaxy were absolutely controlled by a minor psychic civilization . <newline> <newline> The Council took the decision after the news of The One Queen being captured , her existence was too much valuable , her unmeasurable knowledge could not be put in risk , and her unique reality warping skills were too powerful to be investigated by the Recktonians . <newline> <newline> The council took the decision . Even if everyone on it was absolutely terrified with the idea . <newline> <newline> In the solar system 2356-35 a little blue planet , which showed signs of intelligent life , something terrible happened . A kind of rip in the natural evolution of the intelligent races . In that planet , somehow one basic animal species mainly based in physical abilities was able to stop the psychic evolution of another superior specie who was developing their oceans by totally extinguishing them . And becoming then by first time in the history galaxy the only physical race developing a kind of intelligent civilization . <newline> <newline> After establish contact with them with every single precaution possible , we decided to keep them secretly in quarantine so they could not contact or interact with anyone else forever . Their mind were too basics to be manipulated , and they rejected totally our instructions , they were interested only in our FTL technology . There was something unique in their basic evolution , they were totally different than us , they have an innate instinct and strong wish to increase their numbers and invade other places it was written in their DNA . <newline> <newline> Of course we stopped the interaction with them , and we made sure that they never were able to reach the technology needed to leave their solar system . <newline> <newline> Until now . <newline> <newline> <newline> After all our own civilization was in danger . Right now in the control room in our last hideout , in this last nest , I and the other members of The Council are witnessing the imminent end of this war : various starships filled with 400.000 humans , absolutely immune to any kind psychic manipulation will land in the main station of the Recktonians in the next semi-cycles . <newline> <newline> Our guilty and our shame is unmeasurable . Very soon , the universe , starting by the Recktonians will experience by first time the most atrocious , awful and horrid form of interaction . Humans denominated it as : Physical Violence . <newline> <newline> Edit : typo ( since english is not my main language please feel free to help me to fix my spelling and grammar ) <newline>

0,"We never thought it would come to this ... that they would make it to our final planet , our home . For years we fought out of protection , war was something that our race was not use to . It did n't make sense , why fight amongst your own flesh and blood when there are so many worse dangerous out there . Like that of the mek'lai , a very power hungry race with a very powerful army whom was now bearing down on our home planet of treknotki with intentions to take everything from us . But even the Mek'lai did not fight against one another , no known species in the entire milky way would wage war against its self . Except for one , they called them selves the human race . Born in war and surrounded by it constantly all they knew was war . Even at times of `` peace '' their leaders prepared for war and dumped more resources into being fit for battle . Sucking away every drop they could squeeze from there own home world with seemingly no digression for the damage they were causing . They moved through every planet in their system squeezing every planet dry . They would have kept going but luckily the equation for FTL travel evaded them , maybe it was luck , perhaps it was ment to be that way ... . Which ever situation , we needed them , we needed their power , their experience . The only question to be asked , is it worth it . Should we give this species that is so infatuated with power it even wars amongst its self the power to move through the galaxies faster then ever before . The consequences could be untold , devastation to a level that has never been seen . The greed they have is unmatched , but it 's our only hope in surviving the onslaught that is the Mek'lai . So we made first contact , they were extremely defensive at first setting up guns and missiles with in minutes of seeing us . But as soon as we mentioned the deal to be made , their greed showed and they become so very friendly as if they wanted us here all along . It 's funny mention some form of payment and it changes there entire outlook on you . We gave them what they wanted and in return they set out towards the fleet of Mek'lai . Though the Mek'lai were strong they were no match for the ruthlessness of the human race . The humans not only accepted war but had a passion for it ..as if they yearned for it . It was a massacre on both sides but no matter how many ships or people were lost the humans kept fighting , in fact the more humans that died , the stronger they became as if pushed by a burning desire for vengeance and destruction . It 's a mindset never seen before . Even the Mek'lai who were so hungry for power did not see the universe in the way humans did . They saw war as a terrible but important tool even they did not like it . ... but the humans , they seemed to have a natural affinity towards it as if they were made for it . The same way in which a cancer travels through a body killing everything because it wants to , because it has to , the humans did the same . The war has only been going on for a few months and they have pushed the Mek'lai back two entire star systems . The war will be won , but what happens when it is over ? ... it 's not a question of IF the humans will fight , but rather of WHO . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> ( I 'm working on two hours of sleep in the past two days and have been on three 3 hour flights so sorry about the shittyness of this story )

0,"It was a last resort . <newline> <newline> <newline> That 's what needed to be done ... The extinction of my race was at stake ! No one could 've known what they planned to do.. <newline> <newline> For those of you reading this log , My name is Kul'Thrat , Lead Biomancer of the Technocratic Hegemony . We were a peaceful race . We were masters of the sciences . Physics , Biology , Engineering , Medicine.. Everything . It was the one thing our race had above our galactic neighbors . For what seemed like an eternity , there was peace . It was all a ruse , of course . Those of us in the High Council knew what lurked inside the false promises of the peace . The Empire of the Von . A despotic , tyrannical empire set on destroying anything that did n't bend to their will . <newline> <newline> The Von controlled such huge swathes of territory , that a small nuisance like the Technocracy could be completely eradicated and no one would bat an eye . This was the High Councils greatest fear . We tried to surround ourselves with allies , promising to advance all of their tech in return for protection . Everyone accepted at first . Then the Empire made their advance . <newline> <newline> Like flies , the other Empires dropped out of the Alliance . We did not curse them , it was the smart thing to do . Of course , we tried to defend ourselves . We constructed massive weapons platforms to the best of our abilities . These worked , for a time . But the Von had endless legions to push against our small defense . One by one , our worlds fell . Our cities were glassed . Entire stations sucked into wormholes . <newline> <newline> They were at the gates , when we sent out a distress to all Empires . We promised to share our FTL tech with whoever accepted our plea . At the time , the only means of travel were through the Artificial Wormholes . <newline> <newline> One Empire accepted . Humanity . <newline> <newline> They were a new race to the galactic scene , but one already feared for their tenacity . Within a short timespan of them being uplifted , they had already amassed one of the largest fleets in the local sector . Within hours , what seemed like their entire fleet warped into our system . Thousands of ships , of all sizes . It was a beautiful sight to behold . The planet erupted in celebration . Our Human Protectors had come to rescue us . <newline> <newline> Anxiously , we waited for the Von to enter the system , and for the bloodbath to begin . It never came . For weeks we waited , nervously . The Humans seemed.. almost too calm . We should 've known something was wrong . <newline> <newline> A week , and four days after the Humans arrived in our system , we recieved the unconditional surrender of the Von Empire to the Humans . In excited confusion , we asked why they surrendered while they were winning . <newline> <newline> Silently , they handed us a vidscreen , and exited the chamber . <newline> <newline> It was the last transmission of a battleship in order around their Capital . A massive fortress of battlestations , and capital ships . All seemed normal , before a blinding flash of light covered the screen . Once it cleared.. We stared in horror . A black hole now resided where their capital once was . It began to destroy everything in the system , before the vid cut to static . <newline> <newline> Over the course of the next few months , The Humans began to annex the territory of the former Von Empire . They had set themselves up to be the dominant power in the galaxy . <newline> <newline> We are grateful to them , no doubt . But.. Scared . Very , very scared .

0,"The human smiled playfully . `` So if I understand you correctly . You will give us this FTL technology in exchange for our aid . All you ask of us is to cleanse your world of this Ashvell species , and remove this substance from your waters ? '' <newline> <newline> `` That is all , '' I said with a hoarse voice . We had n't done much research on these creatures . All we knew was that they had yet to fly further than their own moon and that they may be our salvation . I stepped back as the human walked by me . He walked carelessly , holding the vial that contained the substance that could destroy my species . <newline> <newline> Water . Yes , we thought it was water . The clear liquid that granted our planet the ability to sustain life . The Ashvell gave it to us as a simple offering , one of peace and prosperity . We had no reason to suspect the Ashvell of foul play . Would you ? We had been on neighboring planets for thousands of years . <newline> <newline> Cast Ozon had started to puke green bile moments after he had swallowed the substance . His elongated neck had melted within mere seconds . Our dear leader had died whilst still holding onto the glass . Before anyone had been able to react , the Ashvell had started their offense . Enormous cannons had sprayed our lands , our homes and our people with the poisonous substance . We thought it was merely water . The Ashvell knew it was not . <newline> <newline> `` You should not keep this substance in an unprotected vial , '' I said . Humans in white coats eyed me as I followed the human leader up a flight of stairs . <newline> <newline> We entered what I assumed to be a living space . Why else would there be a sleeping platform in the center of the room ? The human sat down and placed his legs on the sleeping platform , leaning backwards . <newline> `` What is your answer ? We have n't much time ! The Ashvell kill our younglings by the hundreds for every second I do not return . '' <newline> <newline> `` Has the United Nations made a decision ? '' The human spoke to the mirrored wall on the other side of room . <newline> <newline> A face appeared on the wall . The human in the wall cocked an eyebrow . His gaze lingered on me . `` You say that this liquid is poisonous to your species ? '' <newline> <newline> A shiver ran down my spine . `` Yes , it is . None of the species in our solar system are able to survive direct contact with this substance . We beg of you , please save us . '' <newline> <newline> `` And simply attaching the technology you wish to donate to us will enable faster than light travel for the vehicle it is applied to ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' <newline> <newline> The face disappeared and I could once again see my own reflection in the mirror . I turned to the human beside me . He was sniffing the substance , twirling the vial around as he did . <newline> <newline> Then he drank it . <newline> <newline> I stood there in disbelief . The human drank the most poisonous substance known to my people . I jumped back , afraid that his body would explode . A mere drop still in his throat could splash out at any second . A mere drop was enough to kill me outright . <newline> <newline> Nothing happened . <newline> <newline> The human smacked his lips and winked at me . `` Twelve percent . '' <newline> <newline> Behind me , I heard the oh so familiar booming of FTL-engines . The humans had accepted our offer .

0,"Contractor Ryan reloaded the shotgun and checked his wingsuit again . It was his third drop today against the Renzzio on Jio Segundus . He 'd accrued 10k already after a short week on Jio . This was easy money . The Jios paid well . <newline> <newline> `` Contractor , bring yourself and Subcontractor Kelly to the cockpit . '' He tapped his teammate on the should and walked the length of the bomber to the cockpit . <newline> <newline> Director O'Brian sat at the controls . Jio-parpar wrapped itself around the other cockpit seat . The director addressed Ryan and Kelly without turning from the HUD . <newline> <newline> `` This is a Renzzio master nest . We have footage of their swarms from the last attack . '' From the HUD controls , Director O'Brian replayed the video . <newline> <newline> Thousands of rubbery crows the size of hunting dogs poured out of clay openings and spun black tornadoes around the nest . The tornadoes turned and zoomed towards the source of the video recording , blacking it out . <newline> <newline> `` Jio-parpar , can we have a moment to ourselves ? '' Ryan and Kelly saluted at the Jios unwound from the copilot seat and rolled towards the cockpit exit . <newline> <newline> `` O'Brian , it 's going to be a bit hard to spend our Jio stipends if we 're picked apart by crows today . '' <newline> <newline> `` You knew the stakes when you signed up , *Contractor* Ryan . '' The director drew out the word . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , but my agreement says that I get all necessary equipment . We can clean up crow singles and doubles with our light arms , but I ca n't take on a swarm with a shotgun . '' <newline> <newline> `` You know we ca n't nuke in this atmosphere , it will burn up the planet . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's not what I 'm asking for and you damn well know it . '' <newline> <newline> `` But we only have three . I ca n't risk it . '' <newline> <newline> `` If you do n't risk it , do you think the Jios or Renzzio will let us leave the planet alive ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Fine . But we do n't even know how these work . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'll figure it out . '' Ryan strapped the FTL engine to his wingsuit . He dropped the shotgun and attached three pulse dueling shields -- one to his helmet , one on each shoulder . They emitted a low electric hum as the charged brown gel coated his upper body and head . <newline> <newline> Ryan dove from the bomber hatch and ignited the retrojets . He buzzed towards the master hive . Just like the video , a huge swarm emerged , darkening the Jio sky . <newline> <newline> A pink light spread like dawn from Contractor Ryan 's back where the FTL engine attached . Ryan 's wingsuit accelerated and Kelly and O'Brian leaned across the cockpit to watch the display . <newline> <newline> A small blur , the contractor slammed into one , then a second Renzzio . They popped like paper bags and his acceleration continued . His suit left a contrail as he encircled the black horde , his pink dawn engulfing the darkness . As the acceleration continued , he was not longer a blur , but merely an electron , virtually everywhere at once . The nest and horde disintegrated , a gray clouds drifting downwards to the planet surface . <newline> <newline> Contractor Ryan emerged from the cloud , rapidly slowing . He refired the retrojets and winged up into the bomber hold . Kelly and O'Brien emerged from the cockpit . Jio-parpar stood before Ryan , offering up the FTL master controls . The humans were victorious on Jio . <newline> <newline> <newline>

0,"Ugly creatures . Sickly pale and pug-faced , they were covered in patches of fur and highly prone to violence . Their skin clung to their skeletons like rubber , vacuum sealed and taut . <newline> <newline> But for their brutish appeal , they would be dismissed as one of the class IV races : confined to their planet because of infighting and inability to work together . A wonder the barbarians had lasted so long . <newline> <newline> But the Sapiens had one boon that Au'tchk had rarely seen in non-spacefaring races . A capacity for hate and violence that made Au'tchk shudder . The terrors they unleashed upon each other would make any galactic commander balk . Poisonous gases , nuclear fallout , crude and savage weapons that barked and shredded flesh . <newline> <newline> Au'tchk turned away from the holo-deck , the particles of light dissipating . The last thing to fade out was the snarling face of one of the `` Humans '' . <newline> <newline> He glanced out a porthole as he walked down the gantry to the bridge . <newline> There , Calamaria was in flames , tectonic plates cracked and steaming from orbital bombardment . Oceans had been vaporized as the plates split , the core of the crown jewel of the Systus sector spewing into the atmosphere . The planet was not dead , not yet . But like a limping Gh'sturth beast , it was only a matter of time until its ' wounds overcame it . <newline> <newline> There , Kanth , once luscious and beautiful , was now a barren rock . All organic matter , including its ' 20 billion inhabitants converted into basic carbon matter . The planet was now covered in the carbonic ash of over a quarter of the Systus sectors ' souls , slowly spinning in the dark of space . <newline> <newline> Au'tchk felt his stomachs tighten , a fury that he had suppressed since the first of the Graal raids . Since the attempts of diplomacy , that had only ended with the savage murders of his embassies . Since his last desperate attempt to save his people , broadcasting on all known frequencies to the deepest edges of space , asking for help . Anything . <newline> <newline> And for 10 years , nothing . <newline> <newline> <newline> Until a race unaware of the ferocity of the Graal responded . A race possibly even more horrific . Au'tchk had studied them intensely , their culture , their language , their capacity for war . <newline> <newline> As he passed underneath elaborate archways and onto the bridge , a blemish of the perfection around it stood at attention . The contrast of such harsh and ugly features around Au'tchk 's people only drew more attention to how perverse these creatures were . How *different* they were . Alien . <newline> <newline> How far they had fallen . <newline> <newline> <newline> Au'tchk drew himself up to his full height , a staggering 8 feet of billowing robes and soft lines . He stared down at the Sapien , its ' beady eyes tracking his every move . He felt as if his bridge was a cage , and he had been tossed to the wolves . <newline> <newline> `` Well ? '' the creature growled . Patches of more hair , dirty looking and wiry , had begun to sprout from its ' face . Savages . <newline> <newline> Au'tchk folded his arms , and waited . The gravity of the situation was immense , the crew turning to watch their captain , their leader , decide the fate of the Systus sector . <newline> <newline> `` We have an accord '' , Au'tchk finally replied . <newline> <newline> The humans mouth extended , flashing sharp ragged fangs . `` Perfect '' it growled . <newline> Au'tchk shivered . <newline>

0,"Ever since first contact , the New Earth government had been wary of our alien benefactors , the Q'ari Republic . <newline> <newline> Every human knew why - it 's pretty much in our blood to be suspicious . The Republic claimed control of an eighth of the Milky Way by volume , more than any other power in the galaxy , yet they were just so ... . *peaceful* . They did n't have a single weapon in any detail that came to Earth , or to Mars , even when their Chosen ( a rough translation of their word for the position of leader ) was touring the place . <newline> <newline> I mean , really ? The New Earth Federation was the only governing body on Earth , rebellion was rare and swiftly doused , and even Mars was mostly under the jurisdiction of the Feds , and President Johnson does n't even go to the bathroom without a bodyguard - I 'm sure that if he was touring the homeworld of some alien species we had never met before , but that was only a few hundred years behind our tech , he 'd be walking around with an army of soldiers in power armor . Yet , their Chosen walks around a planet that learned that they have to negotiate if they want to settle any more worlds in their own solar system , since this 'Republic ' claimed the place while we thought we were the center of it , without a guard in sight . <newline> <newline> Now that 's suspicious , ask anybody . <newline> <newline> As Director of the Department of the Dry Navy ( to differentiate us from the wet Navy : They patrol the seas , we patrol space ) , I was on the committee that met their Chosen , some thirty-two years after they first landed in Germany . <newline> <newline> I wo n't bore you with the details of the conversation that ensued - lots of pleasantries , passed by their delegation with a seeming nervous apprehension , and returned cautiously by ours . I 'll keep this short , and skip to the good part , when we figure out why their demeanor was so starkly different . <newline> <newline> As it turned out , one of the many 'protectorates ' - governments formed within the borders of the Republic with territory they had before meeting and territory they had negotiated for , exactly like the New Earth Federation - had finally gained technological parity with the Republic - They did n't say so , but my first thought was that they managed to get some spies into their shipyards - and this 'Galactic Imperium ' had been waging a rather successful war against the Republic . So far , to our astonishment , the Imperium had taken all of Republic space , including their core systems and even the binary partner of the star Q'ari ( the Republic capital ) circled , with the stated goal of killing each and every Q'arian in the universe . Their motivation ? Revenge for a few hundred years of perceived oppression , which seemed fair enough to me . <newline> <newline> Of course , we were unable to conceive of how a body of a few systems , even with technological parity and the element of surprise , would be able to conquer so much space so quickly - By our estimates , they should have been crushed under the yoke of Republican industry if nothing else . Apparently , the Republic was simply too pacifistic - They had the material , but not the will to use it nor the experience with its use . This was made plainly clear to us as their Chosen lamented that the Imperium built dedicated warships , as if it was brutal to have ships of war . Apparently , that was a trait that very few species shared , to be 'brutal ' enough to actually field dedicated weapons of war instead of just mounting a few guns on a cruise liner and calling it a battleship . I ... still do n't really get that part , but what do I know , I 'm only human ... <newline> <newline> Anyway . With the details of the Imperium 's rapid takeover of Republican space in front of us , President Johnson asked the important question . The Republic only had control over two systems - Sol , and their capital and homeworld . The obvious question is , why did they reinforce Sol , and fight two costly battles to hold it , rather than keeping their own home from being at risk . <newline> <newline> As it turns out , humans are well known to the galaxy to be the most brutal and warlike race known to anyone . So much so , that the Republic was banned by intragalactic treaty to prevent us from obtaining faster-than-light drive , so we would n't go conquering everyone . <newline> <newline> 'But ' , as their Chosen said , 'we are desperate . The Q'ari race stands at the brink of extinction . Our treaties are no longer an issue - We 're blockaded on every side , we ca n't send a ship out , no one else can send a ship in - No one is more brutal on the field of battle than the soldiers of the Galactic Imperium - Except you . ' <newline> <newline> His lieutenant stepped in : <newline> <newline> 'We have with us detailed plans of almost every technological achievement we have made that you have not . Energy shields , zero-point reactors ... Faster than light engines , both of the tunneling and warping variety . These plans should be sufficient to.. to allow your scientists and your engineers to develop you to the same level of technology as both us and the Imperium . ' <newline> <newline> I was suspicious . `` Why would you give this to us ? '' <newline> <newline> The Chosen turned to me . <newline> <newline> 'We will give this to you in return for a promise . A promise that you will not turn the weapons we hand you upon us , and a promise that you will shelter us from the onslaught of the Imperium . <newline> <newline> A promise that the Q'ari race will live on . ' <newline> <newline> After that , there was pretty much no need for us to discuss what we would do . All the gain , for pretty much no loss ? The only debate was if we could hold back this Imperium , and that was indeed a question . The Republic did not have any solid information on the sizes of the enemy fleets , nor of their capacity to produce more . The Republic had summoned its last scraps of fleet , its merchant vessels , its private ships , everything was confiscated and enlisted into their navy for the purpose of holding the Imperium back . They estimated that the Imperium would n't commit much to this last phase , preferring to use its ships to solidify its hold on the territories that would be looking for an edge than to put an end to a defeated enemy , so the estimate was that the Republic would hold for a year before the Imperium punched through and reached Earth . <newline> <newline> With the scientists of the Republic helping us figure things out , well , I liked those odds . We pulled a few asteroids out of the asteroid belt , set up a few lunar mines , and got to work . <newline> <newline> First , we built orbital shipyards . We needed infrastructure if we were going to raise a respectable fleet quickly , and our old docks were n't going to do the trick with the new tech . At the same time , our best engineers set to designing a warship with the new goods : One that was well armed and armored , capable of solo warp flight and surviving wormhole traversal , and most importantly one that was cheap enough and easy enough to manufacture that we could build fleets of them with the resources at hand before the Imperium arrived . <newline> <newline> Once we got going , we even made a few improvements . A test drone was used to find a way to cloak the emissions of the zero-point reactors , sensors , communications , and the warp engines , and we integrated these into stealth frigates , lightly armored , heavily armed , equipped with tons of equipment for intelligence gathering and transmission . Another team managed to get a few more percent efficiency out of the shielding , along with faster charge times , and this coupled with an enhancement to the reactor cooling became the core of a battleship fleet that had double shields , heavy armor , tons of guns , powered by two parallel zero point reactors . One of these ships even became my flagship , the *Salvation* . <newline> <newline> We carried on with the standard routine of preparing for total war - the routine that apparently only humans were actually capable of , the routine of converting industry to a war machine , of training tons of civilians into a military , simple stuff - Until news came that the Imperium had dedicated its whole fleet to a last push , two months early . Q'ari had fallen , and the last Republic ships were headed our way . The Chosen expressed his hope that we were ready , a hope we all reflected . <newline> <newline> Three Republic ships arrived , carrying about three thousand Q'arian citizens , tailed by the Imperium fleet . Our reactions were either shock or laughter - The fleet we had been fearing was one of around 750 ships , and we had raised a fleet of 1,547 ships that were by all indications better armed . The Q'ari reacted with dismay - 'What have we done ' was a common one , as they watched what we learned was the largest fleet ever gathered slip into a combat formation . <newline> <newline> The Imperium was routed . They engaged us , and we destroyed them , letting their ships burn . We gave no quarter - We fought with the ferocity humans have been fighting each other with since the dawn of time , a ferocity not even the Imperium could match . The Imperium attempted to pull their scattered fleet out of the solar system , but our frigates gave chase - Uncloaked frigates tagged targets , and cloaked ones fired their deadly payloads unseen , much like wet submarine warfare . <newline> <newline> Aboard *Salvation* , the battle report was overwhelming . Even the Mars Rebellion had incurred heavier losses - Over five hours of battle and three days of chasing down the enemy , we had lost three hundred ships , and five hundred had suffered significant damage , for a loss of life of about fifteen thousand after escape pod recovery , plus twenty thousand wounded . We did n't have casualty numbers for the Imperium , but the Republic did n't lose anything once our fleet got under way , and the Imperium lost seven hundred and forty-eight ships , with one disabled ship captured for research and one heavily damaged ship forced to surrender and ordered to return to its superiors and tell them of their losses . <newline> <newline> The Imperium capitulated shortly thereafter when five hundred of our ships appeared at their homeworld and destroyed their orbital stations . The Q'ari regained their home , and we looked to the stars . <newline> <newline> It 's late , Johnny . How about we settle down for the night . <newline> <newline> Tomorrow , I 'll tell you all about how your dad was at the front of the fleet that united the galaxy .

Today is our first real confirmation that we 're not alone in the universe , and the first thing we have to do is fight a war ... '' Her voice trailed off and her eyes became unfocused . `` I suppose that 's about right . The way life works . '' <newline> <newline> The words had no ulterior motive behind them , yet Qard was simultaneously reassured and chilled by them . Reassured that this culture was so steeped in warfare that they believed it was the universal order of life , and chilled by the same fact . There was no doubt that humans could win this war , but there was also no doubt that they 'd win many , many more after their first introduction to Fluan technology . <newline> <newline> The human 's eyes snapped back to him . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry about your plight , but we have no way to fight on the fronts you 've specified . We 've barely colonized our own solar system ; we do n't have the resources to wage an extra galactic war . '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course not , '' Qard said , a note of exasperation creeping into his voice . `` We do n't expect you to do so yourself . The Fluans have prepared a number of vessels capable of faster than light travel . A ... fleet . '' He hesitated not because he did n't know the word , but because 'fleet ' should never have been used to describe Fluan spacecraft . The assorted ships were used chiefly for exploration , business travel , or pleasure . The thought of a Fluan diplomacy yacht spitting death nearly made Qard himself violent . <newline> <newline> `` They have few weapons . Our engineers will work with you to outfit them with whatever you need or desire . Once the war is finished , whether we win or lose , the vessels will be yours to keep and study . '' Not the full truth . Humans could study them right up until The Council of Flua remotely detonated them . Humanity was n't quite ready to join FTL civilizations yet . <newline> <newline> `` And how about our numbers ? '' She asked . `` Including our colonies , we number 28 billion . A fraction of that would fight for you . Is that enough ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Your numbers are sufficient . '' He did n't mention that humans reproduced at an unusually high rate compared to the rest of known life forms . Their numbers were n't completely ideal , but they 'd easily make up the difference . <newline> <newline> `` Excellent . Last question , then . I am the Primary Elected Leader of the Terra System . I can guarantee majority support by both the High Military and High Civilian Representatives . The question is , why should I ? Why should we choose a war to introduce ourselves to the universe , and why yours ? '' <newline> <newline> A question Qard had not been expecting . He and the Fluan Council had assumed that the novelty of a new form of fighting , and the vast resources offered by the galaxy at large , would be motivation enough . <newline> <newline> `` We have the respect of a great many civilizations . If you were to help us , the trade opportunities- '' <newline> <newline> `` Then why are n't they fighting for you ? '' she cut in . <newline> <newline> Qards felt his antennae stiffen , the equivalent of a human narrowing their eyes . `` They fear our enemy more than they respect us . Defeat the Cramoul and you 'll have respect as our allies , and fear as Cramoul 's vanquishers . Humans have a great capacity for violence , which is why we come to you now . We face near extinction . You will prove your place among the greater civilizations by staving off genocide . It is a guarantee that no other planet will offer as much . And we have not communicated the location of your planet . If you lose , you can vanish to your home system without a trace . Even we Fluans found you by accident . '' <newline> <newline> Her eyes became unfocused once more . <newline> <newline> `` Yes . Yes , I think that will do . '' <newline> <newline> * * * <newline> <newline> Fifteen years later , the Cramoul were pushed back to their homeworld . With victory accomplished and celebrations competed , humanity returned to Terra , and Flua betrayed them by detonating the FTL drives , as planned . <newline> <newline> Four years after that , the Fluan Council surrendered to Primary Commander Margaret Waller , of Terra .

1,"Jayce stood in the center of the arena . The same walls , the same stands , the same noise . The same scene he had seen once a week for four years . Another week , another easy job . Another paycheck . <newline> <newline> His opponent stood opposite him , almost against the door he had entered in . Just another faceless body , already dead . The man stood there . The distance was just far enough to prevent Jayce from recognizing any features . Just the nondescript , grey combatant 's garb . Just like all the rest . <newline> <newline> He listened to the countdown absently . He really did n't need to prepare much . Idly , he ran his finger 's through his hair . Arcs of electricity flittered throughout , excess power released by the movement . <newline> <newline> As the countdown reached 10 seconds , Jayce drew his left head from his hair , teasing out a huge arc of electrical energy . The smell of ozone filled the air as it lit up the entire arena . <newline> <newline> 5 seconds . He used his right hand to catch the other end of the arc , holding it between his hands . He calmly extended his right hand , to point directly at the dead man who stood before him . He slowly approached his right shoulder with his left hand , lining the arc of electricity with his right arm . <newline> <newline> 1 second . As the countdown finished , exactly on rhythm , his hand touched the shoulder . A blinding flash and deafening roar unleashed . <newline> <newline> __________________________________________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> <newline> The crowd watched , bored . The stands were at hardly 10 % capacity . No one bought tickets to a Jayce fight to see a good show . Tickets to his fights were cheap , and it was always just a quick spectacle for idling tourists who ca n't afford to book a real fight . <newline> <newline> As the countdown reached ten seconds , everyone stopped moving about . It was only going to last a moment , so it 'd be easy to miss . Everyone trained their eyes on the poor sap who was about to be killed . At one second , a few people thought to close their eyes . The rest did n't take the warnings seriously , and ended up blind for a few days . <newline> <newline> # CRA-BOOOOOOOOOOOM ! <newline> <newline> As the roar died down , and the lucky few who closed their eyes regained their vision , they retrained their attention to the spectacle . They already knew what they 'd see . A massive crater , charred ash for dozens of meters , and no body to recover . It would be the same as every other fight Jayce had won . <newline> <newline> Instead , they saw only a relatively small impact crater . Confused , they looked around , then their eyes fell on Jayce . Or , rather , his headless body bleeding out into the sand . It took a few long moments before they realized he had actually lost . Standing opposite where he had been originally , in his same motionless stance , was the unnamed challenger . <newline> <newline> No applause was heard in the stadium that day . <newline> <newline> ________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> A story I 've been looking for a chance to share for quite sometime now . Probably too late for this thread , but I 'll just leave it here regardless . <newline> <newline> I essentially took this as a chance to exercise my `` show , do n't tell '' techniques , trying to leave all the important information that is going on to be deducible as secondary information . <newline> <newline> Please , leave your critiques if you have any . I really want to improve .

1,"SO THIS IS <newline> <newline> <newline> It ’ s safe to say the day started like any other . The sun ’ s light beat through the blinds and pierced my eyes with tact . It wanted me to rise , and there was no point fighting back . The bugs I share my bed with ravage on my skin as I try to lie back down and even soon , that dreadful alarm will invite itself to the party . Sadly , like the saying goes , resistance is futile . <newline> <newline> I closed my eyes once more to deeply inhale the air around me and slowly exhale as my day begun . <newline> <newline> The morning duel with the mirror was the same as ever , it always had a way of shooting down my confidence . The bags beneath my eyes hung lower than a thug ’ s trousers and the scar on my neck , well tha- “ b-b-b-bib b-b-b- ” That was the alarm . Startled by the intruder , I quickly clothed and head out of my room into the city . <newline> <newline> These streets have never changed , the only thing new were the people that walk them . For some reason , I always find myself walking as fast as possible . Dodging and weaving through the people like a motorbike in traffic , speeding fast - into the past . <newline> <newline> One foot in front of the other , I paced through the crowds as a thought crossed my mind . I realized it wasn ’ t a conscious decision for me to be walking at this speed , which makes me think that it 's my subconscious in control of this habit . Why do I want to get past with such haste ? Wouldn ’ t it be more enjoyable to slow down and take in the world around me ? This realization caused a sudden stop and I stood idle as I took a deep breath . <newline> <newline> This isn ’ t so bad , the speed I mean . I was walking at a regular pace and could feel the flow of the streets energy . However that energy quickly turned hostile when I lifted my head to follow a bird with my eye . <newline> The people in my vicinity looked towards me and short after , an orchestra of gasps and screams filled the streets as they saw the state of my neck . They could see the large scar and bloody stitches that wrapped themselves around the meat keeping my head attached to my body.The stabbing pain from their looks and screams became too much to handle and watching children cower in fear behind their parents legs was the final straw . In retaliation , I dug my head into my chest and began to speed through the streets as I usually would . <newline> <newline> As i ’ m passing through these people , I begin to remember why I walk at this speed . So nobody can see me in detail . So nobody can see my neck . The overloading self hate and confusion kick in and I make a full dash for my apartment to re-collect myself . Where did this scar on my neck come from ? Why do I forget to hide it each day ? Why do I even leave the house at all If I know it will be like this ? <newline> <newline> The tearful run back home is always as fast as I need it to be . I 'm grateful to be home so soon but although nobody can see my neck here , I can see the clock 's hand will soon strike to 6 . The time I fear most . I poured myself a glass of water and closed my eyes to help bear the pain of drinking it . I closed my eyes once more to deeply inhale the air around me and slowly exhale as my fear manifested itself . It was now 6 .The room turned a crimson red and large volcanic constructs rushed from the floors and ceiling . <newline> <newline> Flushed into a near full darkness a black mist emanating a purple aura took life and hovered in front and towards me . The mist erratically shape shifted into a solid black sphere and then slowly began growing eyes all around its body , one eye grew larger than the others and sat perfectly in the middle . I wanted to scream , I really wanted to scream , but my neck wouldn ’ t allow it . I desperately wanted to run but there was this feeling of emptiness preventing me from moving . Drooping my head down , my eyes widen to the sight of a limbless body . All that remained was my torso , my neck and my head . Painlessly I was dismembered by whatever this thing was . In my head I had already accepted defeat - I had no reason to harbour thoughts wondering what or why . <newline> <newline> A heavy breath came from the large eye as it reached its full size and ever so quickly , it pierced my soul with an unnatural gaze . Do you know the saying “ If looks could kill ” ? Unfortunately , this wasn ’ t enough to kill me , instead a black flame began to rise from the top of the sphere ’ s head . The center of its body began to rumble and shake and the eyes darted around in a most unpredictable manner , It was terrifying . I forcefully tried to close my eyes but before I could enjoy even a split second of darkness , tiny black hands shot out from the sphere and ripped my eyelids away from each other . It wanted me to watch . I gave up trying to resist , I just wanted to die already . <newline> <newline> The sphere ’ s movements quickly stopped and each eye slowly adjusted their view to my neck . Within seconds the sphere had split itself in two , losing no mass whatsoever essentially cloning itself . The two spheres began to orbit what was left of my body and they came to a halt at either side of me to release a black mist from their largest eyes . The mist slowly began to settle and form what looked to be my saving grace , a duo of Scythes.. I looked up to admire the burning black blades that would soon take my life and as they came jolting down for my neck , I began to remember my fate . <newline> <newline> My head slid along the ground and hit a bed of rocks in front . I closed my eyes to deeply inhale the air around me and exhale as the transition begun . <newline> <newline> During this stage , I remember it all . I remember why the sun penetrates the blinds so sharply in the mornings and I know why the sheets of my bed are ridden in bugs . It ’ s so that I get out of bed each day . It ’ s as if he take parts of my memory away at the start of each morning , leading me to think as if it 's a regular day of my dribble of a life until the clock reaches 6 . Clueless , I walk around in that prison and all I have are the wounds of my past life 's mistakes . Also the fear of the clock turning 6 and the fact that my neck is terribly scarred . <newline> <newline> The crushing pain I feel from the people who look at me in fear and disgust refreshes itself each day . It makes me wonder if the thoughts that encourage me to leave the house in the first place are thoughts placed by him . He even went as far as to lure me into lifting my head high by having a pigeon fly past me . That could just be an act of my paranoia but god knows what he is capable of . The constant refreshing of the day and my memory is so that I feel the pain and terror of this life over and over again , like an infinite loop . <newline> <newline> So this is hell , an eternal punishment for sins that I have long forgotten . I spend each day walking the streets unknowing of my scars origins and although i 'm aware it 's there , I forget to hide it . The people change but their reactions are always the same , the pain and confusion that I feel are the same too . Once 6 , the origins of my scar begin to show themselves as my world is enveloped in red , and unnatural creatures begin to spawn . The forming of the black sphere also feels like a new experience each time too , I sit in agony as I watch a monstrosity spawn and slowly take ownership of my limbs each day , it doesn ’ t register in my brain that I ’ ve seen it a million times already . I am destined to this path of infinite pain and torment . That is the power of his eternal prison . As I lay here watching my body being sewn back by Lucifer himself , I remember why there is such a dreadful scar on my neck . <newline> <newline> I close my eyes and inhale the air around me and exhale slowly as my new day begins .

1,"Working on my thesis at the moment which revolves around my Dad growing up as an ethnic minority in Vietnam during the war ( Degar , Rhade/E De tribe ) . But also working on a collection of short-shorts about my mothers life growing up as well . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Our Garden in Saigon <newline> <newline> I was seven , and my mother and I pushed a food cart around the city . We took turns with the cart , though when it was my turn she guided with one hand on the cart , another on my shoulder . We went from apartment to apartment , house to house , business to business , and everyone bought our food . <newline> <newline> The cart was metal , clean and polished . It had an umbrella attached to the middle ; my mother opened it up whenever it rained or the sun was too much for us to stand under . There was a heater off to the side of the umbrella stand , fueled by a propane gas tank underneath . My mother was always adamant about her food staying warm . On the side of the cart sat two small handles for pushing . <newline> <newline> We sold sandwiches - bánh mì . We did not have a business name , so most people called us “ Thi and her daughter ” . My mother was a good saleswoman too , always smiling and never making bargains . No one complained though ; her sandwiches were the best in Saigon . <newline> <newline> The war took my father when I was very young . He said the sandwiches were the best , but only because he grew the vegetables . He had started a garden outside of our home before he left to fight in Pleiku . The garden was lush , full of peppers and cucumbers and mints – everything we needed to make bánh mì . It was all we had left of him . <newline> <newline> My mother sang over the garden every day , the same songs my father sang when he taught her how much water the soil needed for the plants to flourish . Her favorite was “ The Comforter Has Come ” , an old hymn we sang within the makeshift missionary churches . I knew she sang the song now because it reminded her of my father , and though I was very young , I knew she sang it over the garden as if it was a blessing for the plants to yield good vegetables . <newline> <newline> Every weekend my mother and I pushed the cart to the radio station a couple of miles from our house . One windy Sunday , we reached the radio station . The numbers “ 504 ” hung on the side of the building in rusted metal . The windows were streaked with dirt and rain spots . A metal staircase led to the large double door entrance , rusted and bent . <newline> <newline> My mother looked at the doors . Normally she would tell me to wait outside , and would bring in a small bag of five or six sandwiches . <newline> <newline> “ Come in with me , ” she said . <newline> <newline> I wondered what was so different today . I grinned and tucked a few sandwiches in a plastic bag and followed her up the steps . <newline> <newline> I watched my mother as we walked toward the doors . She looked tired . Dark bags rested beneath her eyes and crow ’ s feet to the side . Her skin seemed rough and leathery from the sun . She was only in her mid-thirties , but looked much older . <newline> <newline> We were not wealthy . We lived in a one room apartment in District 3 , where people thought it was ok to throw their trash out onto the street . But my mother was adamant we ate well . She made soups and curries with ingredients she bought at the marketplace . She only had one rule , and that was to never eat the bánh mì . “ They are for the customers , my daughter , ” she said . <newline> <newline> We stepped inside the radio station that Sunday , and it smelled like burnt coffee and mold . Hallways split in each direction , and a small , empty desk sat at the front of the lobby . A phone rang there . Rang and rang . <newline> <newline> My mother nudged her head toward the hallway on our right . There were plenty of people moving around , stacks of papers in their hands . Two men sat inside of an enclosed booth , headphones covering their ears as they spoke through fluffy microphones . <newline> <newline> I followed behind my mother , followed her long , black hair , swinging side to side as she walked . I still carried the bag of sandwiches , and it was getting heavier now . My sandals stuck to the tile floor , stained with old gum and spilt coffee . <newline> <newline> We reached the end of the hall , where my mother waved at one of the men in the booth . He was clean shaven , and had a broad forehead . He looked up from his thin glasses and nodded at her . He said something into the fluffy microphone , took his headphones off , and walked out of the booth to greet us . <newline> <newline> “ Finally , ” he said . “ I am starving , where is the food ? ” <newline> <newline> “ This is my daughter , Cúc. ” My mother put her hand on my head . <newline> <newline> The man looked at my mother and then squinted his eyes at me like he did not believe I was actually there . <newline> <newline> “ Uh , hello , ” the man said . “ Can I speak with your mommy in private ? ” <newline> <newline> I nodded . <newline> <newline> He pulled my mother aside while I watched . They spoke quietly and I could see the man start to get frustrated . They started to get louder . <newline> <newline> “ You didn ’ t tell me you had a child , ” I heard . “ So you are married now too ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Was , ” my mother said . “ My husband died in the war. ” <newline> <newline> The man stomped his foot and stormed back into the booth , his eyes wide like skies . <newline> <newline> My mother walked back over to me . She gently pushed me down the hall , and I dragged the bag of sandwiches behind me . I turned my head and the man slammed headphones over his ears , and shouted into the microphone . <newline> <newline> We left the radio station and never returned there to sell sandwiches . Two weeks went by . Kids at school called my mother a whore . The man at the radio station had spoken publicly about my mother , how she had slept with men for the money , though she had been his only mistress . <newline> <newline> My mother picked up another job . Worked in a small restaurant near Lam-Son Square , cooking and cleaning and whatever else they made her do . I had to stay home and turn off all the lights , shut all the blinds when she was gone . We no longer ate soups and curries . We broke her rule , ate the bánh mì she cooked from the food cart because she had become too withered by the stress . <newline> <newline> One morning , I woke up and went outside . My mother was at the garden , harvesting banana peppers . She did not have enough money to support most of the garden now , and half of it had started withering away . <newline> <newline> She squatted over the plants , plucking peppers and putting them into a small wicker basket . She sang the same song , “ The Comforter Has Come ” , but now her voice quivered like rippled water . <newline> <newline> “ What do you want to eat tonight ? ” she said , and cleared her throat . <newline> <newline> It was a question I had not heard in the last few weeks . “ I thought we were just going to eat bánh mì. ” <newline> <newline> “ Whatever you want , tell me , ” she said . <newline> <newline> “ Can we eat curry tonight ? ” I said . “ I liked the curry you used to make , except not as many potatoes. ” <newline> <newline> “ Ok , ” she said . “ I ’ ll do that. ” <newline> <newline> I sat down , cross-legged in the dirt and watched her pluck the peppers from the garden . She moved over to the cucumbers and green beans , and I could see her face reddening . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry , ” she said , almost a whisper . “ Can you forgive me ? ” <newline> <newline> “ For what ? ” I said . <newline> <newline> She plucked and plucked , moving down the garden , where dead fruit lay on wilted flowers . “ Can you forgive me ? ” she repeated , and stared at the garden . <newline> <newline> I know now that she was speaking to my father . <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"Loptr had long ago given up trying to map the constantly shifting alien world . How could anyone possibly map out a world that changed with each visit ? The wild untamed landshe navigated changed too easily , the fickle thoughts of a single man unable to anchor them to any semblance of consistency . Most considered them impossible to navigate ; with distances , locations and even time that changed on a whim . To nearly anyone else , coming out this far into the untamed wilds would be tantamount to suicide . <newline> <newline> A clever man such as Loptr could take advantage of the very traits that made the untamed wilds so impossible to navigate in the first place . He came here following a trail . A very special type of trail . When a traveler passes through these lands they do n't leave behind footprints , they leave behind expectations , memories , and even feelings . Expectations about what the land should look like were the most important , as they were what shaped the land . Usually . Some areas could become influenced by the echoes of past travelers . With so many variables it sometimes seemed impossible to track anything , even to Loptr , but was confident ; he had done this before . <newline> <newline> The man Loptr was tracking was from an honorable tribe of nomads who live in the deserts to the east of Loptr 's homeland , and they called themselves the Arashin . Or at least they had at some point . The world of Loptr 's homeland had been turning without him for a very long time , and he couldn ’ t be sure of anything . He had finally found a piece of the untamed wilds that remembered being a desert , and the way it was holding that form so strongly made him think he was getting closer . An Arashin would surely leave desert trail in his wake , Loptr only had to be sure it was a trail and not a spontaneous memory . <newline> <newline> Loptr closed his eyes for just a moment to focus his will . In that moment he thought back to his childhood . When he was little he used to climb trees outside his village . The grown-ups cut down all the good climbing trees , so he always had to hike out at least an hour to find a good one . His favorite tree had a well-worn path from all his frequent visits and he had always found it worth the trip . His big brother had had to carve out the first three hand-holds for him before he could reach the branches . It was their little conspiratorial secret as mother never wanted him to climb such tall trees . He did n't like getting sap under his fingers but no other tree had a view quite like it . Sometimes , he would sit in its shade and listen to the creak of its branches gently swaying in the wind . <newline> <newline> The gentle creak of the branches drew Loptr 's gaze upward to the tree of his childhood that suddenly towered over him . He knew none of it was real but somehow it still gave him a twinge of nostalgia for home while he clambered up the familiar braches . His home might not exist anymore , but as long as he lived it would never truly die . <newline> <newline> Aside from the little pocket of soil containing the treehe had willed into being , Loptr could see that the desert continued to the North and South , while the swirling unformed quicksilver ocean that made up this world filled in the gaps to the East and West . From such a great height Loptr could just make out the careful trail he had left behind to the East dissolving away into the roiling unformed sea . He gazed at the sea with a bit of concern touching his purple eyes , studying the random waves he became concerned that they may be roiling a bit too much . It could be nothing , but the change could mean someone , or something , was following him . He would have to get closer to tell for sure , but right then that wasn ’ t a chance he was happy to take . Getting too close to the edge of the desert could be dangerous , but in this case uncertainty was even more dangerous . Even his unnaturally clear mind would leave an impression on the land if he got too close to the edge of the quicksilver ocean.He was all too aware that in these lands he was both hunter and prey . <newline> <newline> An enormous tree sitting alone in a desert was too obvious a sign for Loptr to leave behind . After he climbed down he made sure to turn the tree back into desert with an effort of will . It was n't perfect , as that small section of desert would assert itself more strongly than the rest , but it would have to do . <newline> <newline> He tried not to worry too much as he approached the edge , not just because the risk , but also because leaving a trail of worry behind would make him easier to follow . <newline> <newline> It was n't far to the edge of the desert . Standing at the precipice of the sand and peering into thewrithing sea of silver liquid Loptr could n't deny that his worries had been justified . The quicksilver sea which normally seemed to reflect a rainbow of different colors when seen at different angles , was just then only reflecting black . At the very edge of his vision he could just make out the slightest tint of darkness . It was enough . `` I thought I had more time . '' he whispered to himself in frustration . And the feeling of frustration around him was strong enough that he could feel it permeating the air , as well as perhaps a twinge of fear.He was slightly unsure whether that was his own fear , or his prey ’ s . He cleared his mind and gathered his will to travel . <newline> <newline> None of his brothers had ever learned the trick he called traveling . It was the main reason he was the only one who ever braved the untamed wilds , but they did n't see a pressing need to learn either , as it was a skill that was only useful this far out and journeying this far out was something they deemed an unacceptable risk to their personal safety . He started walking north through the soft desert sand , imagining his stride stretching to cover more ground than normal . His stride carried him a little further with each step , and after a dozen paces he was able to cover the distance from one horizon to the next with each step . He tried to tell himself he was n't running away , but each step he took made him feel a little safer . <newline> <newline> The desert seemed to go on and on for leaguesbefore something finally changed . Between one step and another he suddenly found himself standing in a grassy field , a soft breeze was carrying blossoms and a scent like lavender was wafting pleasantly from a nearby grove of trees , it tugged at the edges of his cloak . After his trek through the desert the wind was refreshing , but it was actually the unnatural feeling of serenitythat Loptr found most refreshing . It was such a rare feeling out here , he sometimes forgot what it felt like . He looked around for a second to take in his new surrounding and saw a man sitting at a cluttered desk writing furiously and looking very out of place nestled between some of the blossoming trees . He blinked his eyes a few times and then rubbed them , but the man did n't disappear . Not only did the man not look anything like the Arashin he was tracking , but the change of scenery was a dead giveaway that this wasn ’ t his prey , this was someone else . Such an anomaly was unprecedented . <newline> <newline> The man wore a white silk night shirt as if ready for bed , but the furious energy of his writing , and the lack of any bed , said that was n't likely to happen anytime soon . His hair was a rare shade of dark brown curly locks and his bushy eyebrows did nothing to reduce the intensity of his bright blue eyes . They were so blue they seemed to give off their own light . Loptr had seen this before and knew that eyes sounnaturally blue marked this man for both a powerful and experienced channeler of Lavihr . Not that a channeler would maintain any special advantage in this world . <newline> <newline> The gaze of the man at the desk absentmindedly drifted in his direction with a look of frustration coloring his face , but after a moment the frustration quickly turned to shock. '' Ah ! Another person . Are you real ? Who are you ? Where do you keep coming from ? '' the man at the desk started demanding , obviously surprised to see another person , but not surprised enough not to give orders . Someone used to being in charge .

1,"*Cung , cung , cung…………………………………………………………………………………………* <newline> <newline> I had never been to Coney Island . I have been living in New York City for four years now and there are so many spots I have yet to visit and take in . I was waiting to go with someone - I am an extrovert , through and through . I thrive on the energy of people around me . If there is something new and exciting to do , I want someone with me . But what happens when there is no one ? You don ’ t go . You put it off . You say to yourself , “ Eh , I will go another day when someone wants to join me. ” And you wait . <newline> <newline> When you are with someone , it is a bit easier . You compromise with your partner and plot together about things you want to do and want to go . It becomes a game , talking about “ what ifs ” of lottery windfalls or even half-joke about how exciting the life of a hit-man would be to fund your globe-trekking . When things are “ good , ” some of these trips actually pan out . You take a train , a plane , or an automobile out of the city ( or into the city ) . You pick apples , you hike , you hold hands , and you are.. Happy . <newline> <newline> When you are single , though , you have to juggle the schedules of your friends . If you have friends . Or if you have friends who are willing to cross the city at the spur of the moment . Is there a difference ? If you are like me , you put off more and more things . You plumb the depths of a plethora of dating apps and sites . You try to make friends in your new spaces , work or school . It comes less easily with age - a lot of things do . Being single is isolating , if you are like me . <newline> <newline> *…………………… Cung , cung , cung……………………………………………………………………..* <newline> <newline> I had never been to Coney Island . It is on my “ to-do ” list . I actually have it posted one one of my dating profiles . Being cheeky , you know ? I read an article reason about being single and how hard it is . The author did a brilliant job and by the end of the article , she hit upon one of the most difficult things about being single - touch . Touch is so wrapped up in notions of romance and sexuality that people do not touch often . If you do , you are one of those “ weird ” people . The label isolates you . If you are with someone - provided they let you touch them - it is fine . When you are single , though , it is isolating . I feel suffocated without it . <newline> <newline> This essay/short story is not something that men write often . Not anymore . It is Not Okay . It is Sad . Once upon a time , it was in vogue for tortured souls to pour out their hearts onto pages in ink . These poets and playwrights , usually plagued with consumption , could express notions of loneliness and sadness alongside their desires for happiness . I read a different article recently about happiness . About how we treat it as a monolithic and static “ state. ” You are either Happy or Sad . I agreed through the writing - by a man - and felt those feels . <newline> <newline> Lately , I have not been happy . To tell the truth , I have not been happy my whole adult life . I can make a list of all the things that have compounded that unhappiness - sad events , tragedies , turns of luck . Some of them certainly well within my control and others well beyond . I have spent a lot of time in my life wrestling with these things to find happiness and I have failed consistently . Is this because I am doomed to be Sad ? Or could it be , like the article I read , an incorrect notion of what happiness inherently is ? <newline> <newline> *…………………………………………… Cung , cung , cung…………………………………… . * <newline> <newline> I had never been to Coney Island . So today , I went . I went by myself . It struck me like punch in the mouth that I should get up , shower , and board the train . An hour and a half later on the D train , I stepped off the subway car and onto the platform and was assaulted . The salt air mingled with the smoke of an endless number of fires cooking food for the waves of people who had descended upon Coney Island for the Labor Day weekend . I stopped and closed my eyes and inhaled . It was like that first breath when you try to see how long you can go without surfacing in a pool . Or when you send panicked kicks against the water because you have been rolled over by a wave . My life depended on this breath . When it was over , my eyes watered as everything from the summer rose up in me . I quickly moved on . <newline> <newline> After feeding myself , I walked down the main entrance and just drank in the people , the sounds , and the feel of the sun who was slowly cooling as the summer wound down . I had spoken with another friend about Coney Island - she had visited there with her mother some years earlier . She recommended the Cyclone . So , I headed there directly to secure tickets and a place in line . For how crowded the beach and boardwalk were , the line to the Cyclone was brisk . I was seated and harnessed in before I got a chance to settle into standing in a line . <newline> <newline> I sat alone in my narrow , wooden car . The whole ride - a nearly century old wooden roller coaster - was wooden save the steel tracks . Around me , squeezed into the rest of cars were couples of all stripes : BFF girlfriends , chattering excitedly ; sweethearts who were nestled against one another with hands held tightly ; fathers and sons , trying to harden themselves for the ride . Melancholy crept in and rode with me in the car . The train jerked and started moving . I closed my eyes and exhaled , focusing just on the climb to the top of the first drop . Excitement squeezed in beside me along with Melancholy . <newline> <newline> *………………………………………………………………………… . Cung , cung , cung………………..* ***WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH . *** <newline> <newline> I swore through gritted teeth as the roller-coaster simultaneously slammed me into the back of my car and vigorously rattled my body in an earnest attempt to scramble me . Up we climbed to another peak , my nervous grimace stretch my dark lips into a grin . And then I started giggling . It was absurd . I was just deep in lamentation about being alone in the car and I was giggling furiously . I could NOT stop . It did not for several minutes after I shakily stumbled from the roller-coaster and made my way back onto the boardwalk . <newline> <newline> I rode another ride . And another . All of them roller-coasters or some sort of thrilling amusement that slammed me , pushed me , and gave me the illusion that I was going to smack into the asphalt or be tossed off into the sky . The melancholy and the excitement melted together , along with the giggles and the joy - perhaps it was the adrenaline ? For the rest of the day , though , I was in a different place emotionally . I rode the rides and the feelings came and I let them wash over me , like the storm whipped waves that had kept the beach closed to swimmers . <newline> <newline> I told a friend about how I was feeling during the day . She said I should write this into a short story . I ’ m not sure if I ’ ve done a good job of that . I don ’ t care . I wanted to pour the rest of myself into writing something today and so I did . I bought a souvenir picture of my ride on the Cyclone and I looked at myself - I was Happy . It seems , though , that only when I embraced all of what I was feeling , expressed it , and rode with it all afternoon that I attained it . And it struck me again , as I climbed the stairs back to the subway to my monastic cell of a room that my notions for Happiness had been wrong . All of our notions are wrong . Happiness is not static , it has flavors and can not be without the sadness , anger , and disgust of our lives . If anything , these things make it sweeter . I accepted this as I careened towards the pavement beneath the wooden coaster that the misery of loneliness had made the moment all the better and powerful . <newline>

1,"Oh man . I have been waiting for this . <newline> <newline> The Infinite Story <newline> <newline> Prologue <newline> <newline> The Lord of Nightmares <newline> -- - <newline> It had begun as… *an itch . * <newline> <newline> That was the best he could describe it . Though irritating , he didn ’ t know what to do about it , so he had ignored it for… well , a few years , at least . He was The Lord of Nightmares and Master of the Dream World . If there was one thing he knew , it was the workings of his mind . He ’ d figure it out eventually . <newline> <newline> Over time , though , it grew : from an itch to a nag… from a nag to a pull… from a pull to a deep yearning . It had even begun to affect his ability to maintain his appearance . The crisp black suit he often chose to emanate would sometimes turn a bit drab , it ’ s mohair lining slightly frayed – it ’ s color slightly faded . When he was really slipping , his suit would change into a set of rags or he would even start to lose his self-image . Once , he ’ d awaken to find that his fine white skin had turned green with scales and that his brown eyes had tinted red . Most commonly , though , the shifts were something small , so although irritating it wasn ’ t anything he couldn ’ t fix with a little focus . “ All the more practice to sharpen the mind ” , he had thought and had left it at that . <newline> <newline> But , now , it was affecting that which he prized most : the hunt . He garnered no more enjoyment from seeking out the perfect victim by stalking them throughout their dreams to consider how to best manipulate their reality . When he caught them , their screams no longer ran a chill down his spine and the display of their mutilated bodies no longer satiated his bloodlust . All there was , ever pervasive , was the pull ... *that insufferable* **pull** . Thus , he decided he would begin a new hunt . He would follow this… *thing* , solve the mystery , and clear his mind so that he could get back to what he enjoyed the most . <newline> <newline> After a few months of travel , warping one location to the next trying to sense minute changes in intensity within the pull , he found what appeared to be the source : an ornate stone archway engraved into a wall located under a trap door within a dilapidated monastery . As he trudged through the crumbling halls , a memory stirred . Yes… he had murdered some old nun here a few years back . He was surprised now that he even remembered . For , when he had cut her , she had not made a sound . When he had taken his demonic forms , she had only smiled . The entire time all she had done was stand in front of him with open arms , a perplexing look in her eyes , until she could stand no more . The kill had been so dull , so disturbingly *boring* , he had done his best to erase it from his mind . He was sure that was why he had failed to look around a bit after he had finished . If only he had ; it would have saved himself a lot of headaches . <newline> <newline> The engraved archway contained the image of a tree that was etched into the stone using words instead of lines . The entire lower half side of it was in the Demonic Language while the other half appeared to be a mirror of the Demonic half , though he could not read it . At the center of the tree were two snakes , consuming each other ’ s ’ tails , coiled around that stupid ying-yang symbol . The upper half was probably some angelic dialect which most likely said exactly the same thing given that upper half of the tree mirrored the lower . It eluded to something called “ The Ways ” or , on other parts of the etchings , “ The Place In-between ” . It was something he ’ d heard of before , but never bothered to look into . *Oh well , no time to understand it now* , he thought . Besides , it was clearly an incantation , so it should work so long as he read it correctly and with as much sincerity as he could . Thus , he read aloud the half he knew while holding his hand on the center glyph . <newline> <newline> The wall shimmered , like water , and evaporated into a doorway . On the other side appeared to be an in-between realm : a void with naught but a dimly lit stone path that lead into a seemingly never-ending darkness . As he had stepped onto the path , the yearning within him increased dramatically causing him to immediately retch . After he finished unloading his stomach ’ s contents into the endless darkness off the path , he headed on his way . At least he could tell that he was going in the right direction . After what seemed like an eternity of walking through the darkness , accompanied with many more bouts of nausea and puking , he came upon the exit of this domain . <newline> <newline> The world he entered into , at first , seemed like the one he left , but in another time . Even though he was bound to the dream world , he could tell a lot about the waking world from it because the dream world takes on the image of the conglomerated thought of its population . Put another way , special cases aside , the dream world usually looks like the waking one , as that is what the majority of those who dream impute upon it . Looking around , he saw castles , citadels and other medieval structures . However , there were also some things which , he ’ d wager , were never a part of his world of his world at any time : floating islands , lighthouses with floating light orbs illuminating the oceans , and a grid of rivers which ran around the world suspended in the air . The most notable change , though , came with some of the inhabitants he spied : the spell casters . <newline> <newline> In the dream world they were easy to pick out . They were often busy practicing spells such as summoning orbs of light or lighting candles with their mind , forcing the dream world to emulate the real for additional practice time . He suspected that this explained why there seemed to be so many skillful lucid dreamers about . It takes a very strong mind to wield the forces of reality to such perfection . He probably would have found himself in bliss in such a place with such challenging hunts ever present . For , when you finally caught up to skillful dreamers , their ideas for battle and escape run dry , the look of terror and surprise in their eyes as their life drained from them was incredibly fulfilling . Unfortunately , in addition to his discovery of this wondrous world , the pull in his mind had increased an amount he thought not possible , so any capacity for enjoyment of his endeavors went along with it . Thus , for the moment , he would ignore his desire to hunt and continue on his quest to extinguish it . <newline> <newline> Like before , it appeared that he needed to locate it the source of the pull . This time , though , it seemed as if the pull was a person , not a place , for the location jumped each night . More , whenever he got close , there seemed to be an invisible barrier that blocked him from entering the dream of his target . Despite the powerful nature of the dreamers here , in combat none had proven to be close to his skill . So , faced with having to learn some stupid form of mind-play in order to get to his quarry , he made the obvious choice : He resolved to hunt in the locations the individual seemed to frequent in hopes that it may entice them to seek him out . At their apparent competence , they should at least know that beings can entirely reside in dreams and that death in a dream within the dream world transfers to death in the real world . With that simple knowledge , it shouldn ’ t take long for his quarry to piece together why his friends were dropping like flies . <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"Fear <newline> <newline> <newline> I woke up in the morning in my big white bed . The silence was deafening . A fly buzzed around me , disturbing my morning calm and making me jerk suddenly . I went to the window . There was no one on the street . No vehicles . No people . No homeless folk . I knocked on my roommate 's door and it opened ajar . The bed was tidy . There was no sign of him . I felt a sudden sense of blankness sweeping my mind . A sense of enormous purposelessness . I shook myself and decided to take a shower . Anything to postpone decision making . I dressed and slipped out the door . The silence crept on me again . There was no noise . No ambient sounds . No white noise . I walked to my car . The car was in the same position where I left it last night . Right next to a bunch of other cars . Is everyone skipping work today ? I drove towards the highway . None of the traffic lights were working . There were no vehicles on the roads . No people . I wanted to let out the windows and scream . I got on to the highway and screamed . The carpool lane was empty . I had never seen the highway like this in the twenty years that I drove to work . Now I was somewhat worried . I had my phone with me . I called my girlfriend . She did n't pick up . I called my friends . No one picked up . I called my parents in a different country . They did n't pick up . I told myself not to get frantic . There is always an explanation , right ? <newline> <newline> <newline> Is it possible I was the sole survivor of a mass epidemic ? Why me ? Why did I deserve to live when no one else did ? Eating two day old take-out food might have given me an edge . I exited the highway and drove to my office . As expected , there was no one at work . I collected some gluten free snacks to get through the bad times coming ahead . I went to my manager 's desk and stole all his fancy markers . That will teach him , ha . Wait , what am I thinking ? I suddenly realized that I was never going to see him again . Though it initially comforted me , it scared me . I left my work place to clear my mind . I drove to a supermarket chain store . The doors opened as I approached them . The store was packed with goods and fresh fruits and vegetables . There was no one . I picked up a bunch of groceries and paid for them at the self-checkout station . I drove to Dvin Peak , the tallest point in the city . If there was any sign of life in the city , this was one way I could spot it . I drove to the top of the peak and opened a bag of chips . There was no one in the city . It was deserted . <newline> <newline> <newline> That is when the first pangs of anxiety hit me . What if everyone had abandoned me ? Maybe they found a way to get to Mars . Or the Moon . But why would they leave me ? What did I do to deserve this ? I munched on some spicy chips and thought about the uncertainties in life . I had always prided on getting through anything in life , come what may . Well , you did n't think this would happen , did you , you smart alec ? I drove back home to pick up some running gear . I walked to the park nearby and started running . Running through the wind . In the sun . With fast paced music blaring in my ears . I cursed and took my earphones away . I did n't want to feel even lonelier . I was sweating profusely now . I took a leak in front of a fancy mansion hoping to scandalize someone . There was no one . I wanted to be shouted at . I wanted to shout at someone . I was desperate . I kept running . I ran by the pond where I usually fed a bunch of ducks . There were no ducks . I ran back home , exhausted . I took a shower and fixed myself a sandwich . I turned on the TV . At this point , I had no idea what to expect . The TV channels were different . They were playing recordings of things I liked . Surely no one else would watch Scooby Doo on a Tuesday night at 11 PM . The news channels were reporting yesterday 's news . I could n't find anything that was happening live . I frantically started calling everyone on my phone book . No one answered . I told myself to calm down . I munched on a bar of chocolate from the fridge to comfort myself . I grabbed a photo of my girlfriend and cried myself to sleep that night . <newline> <newline> <newline> I woke up with a headache . There is one place I have n't gone to yet . The ocean . The ocean is always alive and kicking . I dressed and drove to the nearest beach . The ocean was still alive , thank god . It was low tide as I ran towards the water . The sound of the waves flowing back and forth was the first sign of motion I had seen or heard in two whole days and I cried . Was God testing me ? Was this God 's way of pushing me away from the honorable path of atheism ? I promised the ocean and the whole world that I would steadfastly believe in the almighty for eternity . I uttered long forgotten prayers and supplications so God would cease to be angry with me . As I was doing this the weather changed dramatically and rain started pouring down on me . God heard me after all ! I started dancing on the beach in the rain . I had n't danced in years and I felt emotions I thought I was incapable of harboring . Happiness , pain , grief , sadness , desire , pleasure - all of them hit me at once , in an avalanche . This must be way God 's way of punishing me for all those years of agnosticism . <newline> <newline> <newline> I walked back to my car , my energy spent , my mind tired of trying to make sense of the mess I was in . There was a stray pebble next to the car . On the pebble was inscribed the words `` Tomorrow never comes '' . I stared at it for a while before picking it up and tossing it into my pocket . I drove back home weakly , erratically . I was the only car on the road so I could make my own rules . I went at 60 mph off a hill and my car was in the air for a brief second before it landed back on the road . I snorted some cocaine and drove like a maniac . I felt I had nothing to lose . I went home and took a long bubble bath before dinner . I lay in bed , satisfied with the state I was in . <newline> <newline> <newline> I woke up to the bustling sound of cars on the streets . I blinked . Did the world not abandon me ? I opened my eyes in a hospital room with my girlfriend and parents dozing in chairs next to me . I called out to my girlfriend and she shrieked happily and hugged me . <newline> `` What happened ? '' I uttered weakly . <newline> `` You were in a coma for a few days . You had an accident . '' <newline> `` Oh . I had a dream . A bad dream . I think it was a dream . '' <newline> `` Do n't worry baby . You will be fine soon . '' <newline> I closed my eyes . I was confused . Was all that a dream ? The feelings of abandonment ? Of being left all alone in this world ? I felt my arms and reached out to my pocket . There was something in my pocket . A pebble . I took it out . It had the words `` Tomorrow never comes '' on it . I panicked and started sweating . I heard my girlfriend shouting out my name until I could hear no more .

1,"A fictional story about the Dutch resistance in WW2 ( I have more if you want to read it ) <newline> <newline> ORANJE : <newline> <newline> The True Story of the Death of Hendrik Seyffardt <newline> <newline> <newline> Call me Jaan . I was born in Holland , nearly 90 years ago , on the 10th of March , 1928 , to my loving mother Charlotte and my father Hubrecht . He ’ d died in Rotterdam during the blitz , and I was there when he did . The story of what happened afterwards , during those dark years of the war is one I ’ ve been reluctant to tell , for even now , as a nearly 90 year old man , I find myself filled with a hesitance , a reservation to even think about it , but the pain of the memory is such that I feel I ’ m about to burst . And no , this is not the kind of bursting that can be remedied with a Ginger beer , sadly . My brunch of lentils and lamb was not , shall we say , the smartest thing to eat , but even as my body is growing more frail by the day , I recognize when it is the most opportune time to move my bowels dear sir . <newline> <newline> Sir ! I don ’ t even know your name , where are my manners ? I see you cleaning and mopping these properties . I know this is a rather well-to-do part of the south of France . I hate how it ’ s called “ Nice , ” nobody knows you ’ re supposed to say “ nees. ” It ’ s the British , good sir . No , please ! Sit ! I realize that you have cleaning to do , but I must argue , these tourists ! They do not even know how to pronounce the name of this city ! It was the same thing with the Germans back in the war . Nobody could say Den Haag properly , it always came out wrong . But only the Germans . Never the French partisans , never the American and British soldiers , even most of the German army at least tried to say the word properly ; it was the SS , and the other officers , they couldn ’ t care less about the proper pronunciation . <newline> <newline> Now , I must admit , after the war , I went back to school , starting in about 1946 , and I was offered pre-clearance for work with the Hawker design firm , and I actually served on the team that designed the first Hawker Hunters . Later , I was transferred to the French firm that built the Concorde . Hence , why I ’ m able to afford a place like this ... I bought it back in the 80s , before it got so expensive after all those Bond movies . I know how to fly as well ! I can tell you the entire takeoff procedure for the concorde , from ignition to rotation . But that ’ s for another time good sir . <newline> <newline> Yes ... I admit , I can ’ t get to dusting those vases . There ’ s always a little too much to do . I actually moved those from where I lived in The Hague during the war . There was a carpentry shop where I worked with a man ... a great man ! Possibly the greatest man who ever lived ! Oh , but he was still young , barely three years older than me , but filled with the spirit of the resistance ! If the Dutch resistance during the war had any sort of figurehead or living body , Xavier Pool was it ! Ha ! He ’ s the reason why I still stubbornly salute the orange halogen lamps on the side of the road . In the war , we did that to spite the nazis . Most of whom didn ’ t care , but there were always those few who did . A little too much… <newline> <newline> I admit , the subject matter is painful , I ’ ve kept these memories locked away for decades . I fear I may only have the energy to tell this story once . You should hear this story as if it ’ s the guy who did that movie where he needs to go into space ... what ’ s his name ... alright alright alright ... Matthew McConaughey ! A fine voice , much better than my raspy , strained vocal cords . Now , as a kid , it was like a western film , you know those old movies with John Wayne and Clint Eastwood ? Being as jaded and angry as I was , and having that same emotion mirrored in Xavier , I was outrageous in the things I did . It was one day , back in February 1943 . A long time ago , yes . I ’ d bet your own parents weren ’ t even alive yet . But it was 1943 . The Hague , during the German occupation of Holland . Xavier and I were walking to the carpentry shop , which was a few blocks away from the main city square ... this , I can remember as if it were yesterday ... Xavier Pool , walking to his family carpentry shop , bared his plaque-stickered teeth at Komissar Klaus the Krusty Kraut , whose dull eyes stared back through the misty veil of the slowly burning cigarette . The Komissar sat in an elevated mound of sandbags , the cold metal barrel of the 20mm MG-151 pointed skyward . Blue-tipped anti-aircraft shells rattled like wind-chimes with a sudden gust . I was in tow . Sergeant Reue waved at us , his face a mirror of the overcast sky and freezing weather . The dust and dirt from when The Hague had last been bombed swirled on the cobblestone , dancing a tantric dance the way dancers used to dance when the Dutch still could . Reue was half again as old as Klaus , a stately , somewhat plump brown haired German with a receding hairline . Reue reminded me of my own father , before the fascists came to our pile of a shelled-out house in ‘ 40 and shot him in his head in front of me . That , admittedly , is the one thing I would never wish upon my greatest enemy ... to see their own family executed . The blitz was probably the most horrifying thing I ’ ve endured , only because I didn ’ t know how to fight back then . The day they killed my father Hubrecht was a crisp , azure day . It was the middle of May , and our house collapsed on top of us- perhaps two or three days after the bombings first began . But I digress . <newline> <newline> What I think spited Klaus the most was that Xavier wore a cowboy hat- this tanned , sun-blasted thing , all days of the year , whether it was hot or cold , sunny and raining . See , Klaus was your typical Nazi ; two hundred-something centimeters tall , gaunt cheeks , blue eyes , blonde hair , but he was meticulous . I mean , I like to keep organized . You see my film collection ? I ’ ve got it organized by director and chronologically , rather than alphabetically . If you ’ re in the mood for Kubrick , you can look at the middle shelf , find “ K , ” and if you ’ d rather watch A Clockwork Orange as opposed to Full Metal Jacket , that ’ s in the middle of the Kubrick section . Doctor Strangelove comes in the beginning , naturally . Anyways , Klaus- and I believe Xavier had this issue too , to some extent- had this weird thing with ... numbers . Anything that came in units of four was untouchable , unthinkable , he wouldn ’ t involve himself with it . He actually rode around in a motorcycle , as opposed to the Kubelwagen , because the car had four wheels . That , and the half-track , but he only used that monstrosity when they were moving supplies . But anyways , Klaus was the sort of “ overseer ” of that neighborhood , and he ’ d made a decree that the only allowed headwear were the soldiers ’ helmet , the officer 's ’ chapeau , and berets . And Xavier , my goodness , it was as if he had a death wish , he wore that cowboy hat everywhere . The fourth kind of hat . And there was nothing Klaus could do about it .

1,"This story is probably going to get buried , but this is a short story I 've recently wrote and have been thinking about sharing ! Criticism appreciated ! <newline> <newline> Blink <newline> <newline> “ Hey Rachel , snap out of it , ” my best friend Emma pokes me from the desk to my right . I sit near the back of the classroom next to the window I normally sit by so that I could get away with daydreaming . I nod my thanks as she turns back to the front , writing down every scrap of information about the test that our teacher would leak . The blackboard is filled with writing about what we would need to know or study for our final . <newline> <newline> I didn ’ t bother with writing any of it , figuring that I can just steal a copy from Emma later . Instead my gaze wanders around the classroom that I have started to associate with my prison for the year . It ’ s a small room crowded in with thirty-one desks , countless posters , and windows scattered along the walls . A shelf decorates the back of the room that would keep me hostage for another ten agonizing minutes . <newline> <newline> My mind wanders once more , thinking about innocent things . Art , boys , and my plans for after school all play about in my thoughts . Today ’ s the first day in ages that my father , Neil , would take off in order to spend time with me . Not that I cared . He ’ d abandoned me years ago when mom died . I ’ m honestly surprised that none of my old baby-sitters were invited too . <newline> <newline> The thought of dinner with Neil must have triggered something in my mind because the next thing I know a strong image takes my entire focus . Neil sits across from me , raising his glass high with a slight smile on his face . That ’ s all I have time to make out before the image rushes out as quickly as it came . I can ’ t even call my attention to it again ; it ’ s barely more than a faint memory already . The details I noticed still seem burned into my mind but anything else about the image I thought up for that quick second have vanished . <newline> <newline> The bell is what brings me to my senses next . The loud ringing blares out to every classroom as everyone begins to tread off to their lockers . I walk beside Emma who is obviously stressed over our final . <newline> <newline> “ I can ’ t believe he would make us study so much ! ” She complains with a groan , glancing over to me . “ I think they should make it illegal to work this hard just for a math class. ” <newline> <newline> I nod and smile , even laughing a little with my friend . “ Hey , are you busy tonight ? Neil ’ s home for once and I don ’ t want to spend the whole night alone with him. ” <newline> <newline> Emma winces and shrugs . “ Your scientist dad is finally trying to make time for you ? Sorry , but I ’ ll pass on an awkward evening. ” <newline> <newline> So I go home alone and wait in my room for several hours reading before he finally decides to show up . I hear the door slam downstairs so I leave my room and descend to the entrance . “ Hey Neil , ” I mumble to him as he looks up and sees me . <newline> <newline> “ How ’ s my baby girl ? ” He grins as he stretches his arms outwards and takes a step forward to hug me . I take a step back . Discouraged , his arms fall to his sides . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m fine. ” I murmur before turning away from him and heading to our dining room to set our table . It ’ s quite empty apart from a single china cabinet , a picture of my parents before me and several entrances or exits to the room leading off into the house . He follows close behind me after taking off his shoes and setting out take-out containers and a bottle of wine from a couple bags he had brought in . I sit down as he pours two tall glasses and hands one to me . <newline> <newline> Neil sits across from me , raising his glass high with a slight smile on his face . “ To my baby girl and her week of finals , ” he raises a glass and expects me to do the same . Even though I ’ m under aged I raise my glass and take a polite sip . Talk about déjà vu . This is exactly like the image I saw in math . <newline> <newline> We don ’ t talk much over the remainder of the meal , but when we do it always ends up with me disagreeing with him or him criticizing my constant rebellion against him . I finally storm out of the room , outraged as another image pops into my mind , much like before . <newline> <newline> This time the image is of a test set out on a desk in front of me . I only have time to read one question before it vanishes as instantly as it appeared . Was that my math final ? I shake the thought from my mind as I finish my ascent to my room and shut myself in . <newline> <newline> Sure enough , several days later on the day of the test , the question sits there at the top of the page . My head swims , wondering how any of this is possible . I can barely focus on the test as my mind scrambles at how this could possibly be . <newline> <newline> I don ’ t see another image for several days . However , the next time it does happen it ’ s something innocent , like passing an old lady walking her cat on the sidewalk . Several others occur after that , and each and every one comes true just like the others . <newline> <newline> I start to call each image a blink because to me that ’ s what it is . They ’ re a glimpse into my future . Sometimes there ’ s days between the blink and the actual event . Even unlikely ones happen . <newline> <newline> Of course I don ’ t tell anyone about this . No one would believe me . I ’ d get thrown into a looney bin and my life would go down the drain . This is something only I can know about . <newline> <newline> I ’ m painting in my colorful room on the first day of our summer break when I get my latest blink . Like usual it involuntarily tears my focus away from reality and into the future for a mere instant . The scene isn ’ t pleasant or nearly as innocent as any of the others . A grotesque image of my father lying on his back in a puddle of his own blood in the dining room greets me . I have time to notice several holes torn through his body in the dimly lit room before reality overtakes the image once more . <newline> <newline> I cry after that . I cry a lot . It isn ’ t fair to have him taken from me . So what if we don ’ t get along the best ? He ’ s still my Dad and I love him . I spend the rest of the day only laying in my bed , thinking and accepting my , or rather his fate . <newline> <newline> It ’ s not until the next day that I make my decision . So what if I saw him dead ? That ’ s the thing about seeing the future : Now you have the chance to change it . I call Emma and invite her over to help me . I can ’ t do something this major on my own . <newline> <newline> She arrives about a half hour later , intrigued by my vague text so early in the morning . “ So , what ’ s this problem you ’ re dealing with and why do you need my help so badly ? ” She asks me almost as soon as she walks in the door to my house . <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"Some untitled space story . It 's intended to be a pretty solid 4 on the [ Mohs Scale of Science Finction Hardness ] ( http : //tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness ) <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Imagine , for a second , that you are standing downrange of a ship as it returns to normal space after taking a gate or jump point . <newline> <newline> What would you see ? <newline> <newline> This requires a number of simplifying assumptions , but physicists love making those , and this is , fundamentally , a physics problem . The first assumption is that the light reflected from the ship will still reach our dimension , which it does . Second , you 'd have to assume that the light reflected from the ship obeys the same set of laws as it does in normal space , which it does n't , but the act of returning to normal space applies a reasonably accurate correction . Third , you 'd require a light source available in hyperspace to actually reflect . Stars do n't actually create light as we know it in that space , but this is less of a problem thanks to all the navigation lights dotting modern ships . <newline> <newline> What would you see ? <newline> <newline> Things start to get very screwy around c , but that 's a given ; there are fantastic reasons why Humans have labored under the tyranny of slower than light travel for thousands of years . An analogy would be useful . Imagine a fighter plane with the most impressive boombox you 've ever seen mounted in its bomb-bay , steadily counting `` one , two , three , four '' and so on as it flies forward . Sound travels at a more-or-less fixed speed for a given atmospheric pressure and temperature , and so when a copper passes you en route to some presumably grisly murder scene and/or donut sale , the sound waves in front of him pile up and the frequency increases . Once the police pass , the waves spread out to the same degree that they were stacked up and the frequency decreases similarly . <newline> <newline> So as the plane approaches at a subsonic velocity , you hear the numbers in order , but at a higher tempo and pitch than they 're being played it . As the plane hits the speed of sound , all the sound waves will pack up and hit you at once . Once the plane goes supersonic , things change . The plane is traveling faster than the sound waves . So at five kilometers away , presuming it 's ear-shatteringly loud enough to be heard five kilometers away , it plays `` one '' and then travels ahead of the `` one '' sound wave . Then , however long it takes to say `` one '' later , it says `` two . '' The `` two '' sound wave is ahead of the `` one '' sound wave , and so on , and so forth . Here is the critical twist : sound travels at a fixed velocity and does not inherit the speed of its source object . The `` two '' soundwave will always be the same distance away from the `` one '' soundwave . So the order that the sound waves reach would be reverse order . So if the plane drops a word every kilometer , then it 'll say `` six '' right above you . Remember , it said `` one '' at five kilometers , and we 're looking for what is said at zero kilometers . <newline> <newline> Only after the plane passes will you hear the words it dropped earlier , so you hear `` six , five , four , three , two , one . '' Or , more accurately , `` xis , evif , ruof , eerht , owt , eno '' because , remember , the words are n't discrete sound waves , they 're a continuous waveform that gets reversed as well . The plane drops the first millisecond of `` one '' , moves ahead a third of a meter , and drops the next millisecond , and so you hear the millisecond-to-millisecond series of sounds backwards . Only it 's not just milliseconds , you hear it from milli-to-micro-to-nano-to-pico-to-femto-to-atto-to-zepto-to-yoctoseconds , all the way down to Planck time , all 5.39E-44 seconds of it . <newline> <newline> So , by this analogy , what do you see when a ship stops making Einstein its bitch ? <newline> <newline> Warp gates accelerate the vessel to exactly c , so vessels coming out of warp appear with a great flash to herald their arrival as they ride along their own wave of emitted photons . Ships arriving from a jump point , however , are a different case . As these ships exceed the speed of light by significant margins , to say the least , the photons that they emit last start the closest to the downrange observer . The effect is a great interstellar bolt of lightning shooting off to the origin of the ship 's latest jaunt into compressed space . <newline> <newline> What does the crew see ? You 'd think that moving anywhere from a dozen to trillion times the speed of light would entertain the crew , but in truth , it 's the exact opposite . When the compression drive is activated it starts as a point source and its field expands outwards at the speed of light . Generally , when physicists model things as point sources , they 're making simplifying assumptions . You can get reasonably good results from an equation that models the Earth 's gravity as a point source , especially the further away you get . However that 's not a true representation . During the Cold War , accurate `` gravity maps '' were national secrets because the slightly varying gravity across the Earth 's surface could pull a ballistic missile kilometers off target . <newline> <newline> Normally , if a physicist told you that a field starts as a point source , that would be a simplifying assumption . With the compression drive , however , that is wrong . The compression drive , due to the fact that the field it generates is not an electromagnetic phenomenon but a spacetime phenomenon , starts as a precise point source and expands as a perfectly uniform sphere at exactly the speed of light in vacuum . <newline> <newline> What this means is that an object one meter closer to the drive is shunted into compressed space almost 3E-8 seconds earlier than the object one meter further away . As the field expands , it creates a wall that shifts matter into compressed space as it reaches it . Importantly , and just like the sound example above , it does not do this on a discrete-object level . If something is moving towards the field generator as it expands , then it will be compressed along that axis , and vice-versa . At significant fractions of the speed of light , atoms can be stretched enough to tear themselves apart , or superimposed to the extent that they undergo fusion . At less-extreme-but-still-damn-fast speeds , molecules will rip themselves apart due to the displacement of their bonds . <newline> <newline> Consider the neurotransmitters and electrical signals fluttering between synapses . They do not move even nearly fast enough for them to all be destroyed , but a non-trivial fraction are , so goes the vagaries of quantum mechanics . Those that are n't are delayed in their arrival or arrive faster than your body anticipates . This is n't dangerous , yet , but it does serve up a weapons-grade headache and tremors . The human body is exceptionally good at repairing itself , however , and recovery takes just fifteen minutes while physical damage is repaired within the day . <newline> <newline> At lower-yet speeds , objects as an ordinary person might describe them get compressed and stretched . A flywheel will , unless its axis is parallel to the direction of field growth , accumulate microscopic fractures if allowed to run when the field is activated . Computers , too , with their pico-scale pushrod logic , are especially susceptible to the field . While the rods rock back and forth less than a nanometer , the speed at which they do so puts them at risk of foreshortening or lengthening , leading to increased risk of failure or incorrect calculations . In the worst case , they can become a very tiny , very brief , star . <newline> <newline> For this reason the crew and equipment spend their trip sedated and powered down , except in emergency .

1,"There isn ’ t exactly time to cry anymore . There are things to do – more important things – and crying doesn ’ t do anything anyways . It ’ s a good thing , too , because otherwise Lily might have to admit she couldn ’ t cry about this . She knows she should want to . Everyone else is sad . She sees the tear tracks and the tired eyes and knows these are sad people . People who have seen too much and been able to do too little and are heartbroken because of it . But she doesn ’ t cry . The world is rushing by and she gets pushed from person to person and place to place , not sure where she is or who these people are any more . <newline> <newline> <newline> The first night she cried . The strange room was too big and she was too alone . Lily let the woman hold her tight against her chest until the tears ran out . But she didn ’ t trust anyone . Not then . Not ever . There ’ s no more trust left in her . She ’ s heard promises being broken too many times to ever believe what people say to her . <newline> <newline> <newline> The day they sat her and her little brother down to tell her what had happened , she had already known . Of course she had known . Hadn ’ t she been the one to stumble down the dark hallway to find her mother lying there on the bed ? Hadn ’ t her screaming been what summoned the neighbors and then the police ? <newline> <newline> <newline> She was angry , so angry , that day . They should have all known long before what was going to happen . But they didn ’ t do anything . They let that monster take her mother from her . And even though she still isn ’ t sure just how much her mother protected her , she is angry . At least her mother never hurt her , never raised her voice or hit her . But it ’ s anger , not sadness , that hits her as she thinks about it . She feels like she has betrayed her mother , except her mother betrayed her every single day of her life . She can ’ t find the tears for a woman who let that monster hurt her . <newline> <newline> <newline> Now of course they are safe . That ’ s what they keep telling her . She ’ ll never see him again . But she doesn ’ t care . Those are just more promises she doesn ’ t want to hear . <newline> <newline> <newline> Lily lets the doctors treat the cuts and the broken bone that monster gave her . She doesn ’ t cry even though it hurts , hurts almost as much as when he gave her those injuries . She sees the horror in the doctors ’ eyes and she doesn ’ t want that . She won ’ t cry in front of them . And then she talks to the detectives and the social worker . She sees how broken the social worker is . That woman has seen too many cases like hers , she knows , and given up hope . The detectives are different . The first man is short and friendly but she doesn ’ t want to talk to him . She likes the other detective better , the one whose anger at the monster is consuming him . She knew the very first time she met him that he was the one who was going to make sure the monster would get caught . <newline> <newline> <newline> The story makes the news and she hears the social worker say that it ’ s only because the children are cute and white and maybe that ’ s why there isn ’ t a problem finding them a foster home . There aren ’ t any family members to take them in – she knew that long before she overheard the social worker say that . Maybe the social worker says too much . But the family who takes them in is nice and happy and she instantly hates them for it . <newline> <newline> <newline> The first night they are there Lily is given a full plate of food . She doesn ’ t touch it . She watches as the wife combs her little brother ’ s hair and she loses it . She grabs him and shuts herself in her room . Through the door she screams at them until she doesn ’ t remember why she was so angry in the first place . Suddenly she has time for tears . She ’ s good at crying silently . The monster didn ’ t like it when she cried . She learned how to hide in the smallest , darkest corner and cry without making a single noise . That night she hides in the closet , burrowing back behind boxes and clothes . <newline> <newline> <newline> When the woman opens the door Lily is angry and scared and confused . But the woman doesn ’ t try to pull her out of the closet . Instead the woman just sits on the bed and picks up her little brother and starts talking to him . After a while the woman starts talking to her , tells her that it ’ s okay to stay in the closet if she wants but that she doesn ’ t have to hide to cry . And she wonders how the woman could possibly know she was crying . <newline> <newline> <newline> Lily pushes her way out of the back of closet and peers through the door at the woman . She ’ s younger than Lily thought she would be . Pretty . Her mother used to be pretty , Lily thinks , remembering that photo her mother used to keep tucked away in the back of the dresser drawer . But the monster took that prettiness away . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The woman doesn ’ t try and coax Lily out any further . She keeps talking , her voice soft and soothing and Lily finds herself drawn to the sound . She hugs her knees tight to her body and listens , really listens , for the first time . The woman meets her stony gaze and smiles a nice smile . Lily likes nice smiles . She hasn ’ t seen one of those for a very long time . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ I want to show you something. ” The woman says , and Lily holds her breath as the woman pushes up the sleeve of her sweater . Lily can see the burn scars covering the woman ’ s entire arm and she cries out , remembering that night . She can still feel the scalding water as it hits her skin , hear those screams that couldn ’ t have possibly been hers except they were . <newline> <newline> The woman leaves her sleeve pushed up and crouches down on the ground in front of the closet door . Lily pulls back but the woman doesn ’ t try to get any closer . She just keeps talking . “ My father did that to me. ” The woman says and Lily reaches out and touches her arm . “ He hurt me , Lily . I had a father who hurt me , too. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Lily is angry when she hears this . “ Monster. ” She says . She pulls back and glares at the woman . “ He ’ s a monster . He ’ s not my dad. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Okay. ” Says the woman . “ Monster . We both had a monster who hurt us . But the monsters can ’ t get us anymore , Lily . We ’ re both safe here. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> Lily looks up at the woman and stares into her eyes and wants to cry because of course they aren ’ t safe . They haven ’ t caught the monster , Lily knows . She ’ s been waiting and waiting to hear that they have . That ’ s all she really wants anymore . But the woman looks like she ’ s telling the truth and Lily thinks that maybe the woman will protect her . She ’ s never had anyone to protect her before . <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"Howard and I sat in our respective chairs , looking through thousands of white specs against the black curtains of the universe . We had been 2 of a team of 15 people working with the Hubble telescope . In reality running an operation like this takes a small town 's worth of people , but as far as the actual research and data collection goes , we 're it . We had aimed Hubble at a pitch black patch of space , focused on and picked up any and all light in the area . We expected nothing . We had sent a man to the moon , we knew better than to 'expect ' anything . <newline> <newline> The pure awe from what was captured after a couple weeks time of exposure was unparalelled . Not one or two distant stars . No ... billions of them ! Galaxies ! Countless tiny little embers . It made us rethink our view of the universe and showed us that there was more to be found . Some things , though , are meant for a certain time and place . Some things , if discovered before their time , can cause wars . Level entire nations . Drive people to depravity to acquire it . <newline> <newline> `` Hmm , after reading the data from Hubble , there seems to be something quite off about the 'Deep Field ' . There 's an incredible amount of light coming from the upper right . Several orders of magnitude brighter than any known lightsource in our universe . It could be the farthest thing away from us in the universe , considering all the data . '' Howard noted . He stuck the eraser end of his pencil upward and balanced his chin on its point . He looked puzzled and also amused . <newline> <newline> `` It 's probably nothing . This photo just proves we have no clue what the hell we 're doing ! We had no idea the universe was *this big* . Just imagine , there would be stars out there brighter than the one you 're interested in . '' I retorted . I did indeed find it interesting , but we had much to go through . We had only catalogued 3 % of the stars within the image . Let alone *researching* them . Stars lives for billions of years , it could wait . I was still on the bottom left corner . <newline> <newline> `` I just , I ca n't stop looking at it now . I just ... is it still pointed towards the Field ? '' He asked , almost impatient . I guess I should just let him get on with it . Howard was a great colleague , a good man , but damn once he gets started he wo n't stop till it 's finished . <newline> <newline> I sighed as I said , `` Yes , the feed is still on . What , you think you can make out anything through a grainy feed with your 23/40 vision ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I just ... wait let me ... '' He put the feed on his computer . I started to get a very uneasy feeling as I watched him while my heart started to bounce around . *The hell was going on ? * <newline> <newline> `` There it is ! ! What is that ? ! It 's just a pixel , but that 's it ... That 's got to be ... '' His voice trailed off . His back was facing me as he sat hunched over directly infront of the screen , inching closer and closer . <newline> <newline> `` Howard ? What ? What is *what* ? '' He was shaking now , still transfixed on the screen , entranced . <newline> <newline> `` It 's uhh ... I mean ... Hahaha ! '' He burst out laughing , yet kept his face directly paralell to the screen . He seemed almost inebriated . `` Heh ... It 's ... Ah god ... . it 's He- ... . '' My heart was bursting out of my chest . I felt an intense dread strike me . This was n't him . I had never seen this in my life . <newline> <newline> `` Howard what the fuck is going on ? Is this some kinda of joke ? '' My voice was shaking . <newline> <newline> `` I 've found ... Heaven ... Hahaha ! '' His laugh twisted upwards on itself in a maniacal fit . He sat there , giggling lazily , rubbing his chest , twitching slightly , small spasms crept through his body as he stopped forming words or sentences . <newline> <newline> `` Heb ... ap.. bluhhh.. hehehe , HAHAHA ! '' He burst out laughing again , in between grunting , writhing , and seeming as if he was trying to speak , yet was lost in ecstasy . <newline> <newline> I got up and walked over to him cautiously , but he paid me no attention anymore . His eyes never left the screen , never blinked . He continued fidgeting around until , he suddenly stopped . He giggle a little , then sat completely still and his mouth slowly lowered . A small strand of drool snuck its way down his chin , onto his pants . I did n't dare look at the screen . I stared at him . His eyes ... oh god his eyes . I will never forget them , lifelessly staring , helpless almost . He looked dead . <newline> <newline> He was a fucking shell . I proded him , slapped him , pinched him . Nothing ... I screamed his name into his ear and he sat , staring . I had called my other colleagues at this point , and they were coming as quickly as they could after I 'd explained this was n't a joke . <newline> <newline> I finally decided to do what I 'd been dreading , yet the only thing I knew would snap him out of it . I felt panic as I reached over ... . and turned his computer off . <newline> <newline> The next bit , I ca n't remember . When they found us , Howard was over me , beating my chest . All of my ribs had been broken . I had a major concussion , lacerations on my arms and collarbone , and was unconcious in a pool of my own blood . I had nearly died that day . They said that when they had finally restrained him , he stabbed a security gaurd in the knee with a shard of glass before slitting his own throat . They said he was speaking tongue 's until the moment before he died , which the gaurd heard him utter , `` Bethany '' before plunging the glass into his neck ... <newline> <newline> I never knew the signifigance of the name . Howard had a wife and no kids that I knew of . He was old enough for his kids to have kids ... <newline> <newline> The 'incident ' became one of the biggest coverups in history . The Deep Field image was doctored , cropping out ... Heaven ... and releasing the rest . The original data was destroyed and Howards computer was replaced the next morning , along with all the rest of ours . <newline> <newline> I dedicate my work to Howard now . He was a good man ... <newline> <newline> There is one thing though . In a box , in a storage locker far from my house , I saved the original image . I never looked at it . Until today , so I 'm writing this incase someone finds me . All these years it 's been eating at me . I just needed to look.. I mean ... I had to ... I just ... I do n't ... *HAHAHAHA ! * <newline> <newline> <newline> ~~~~~~~~ <newline> <newline> Thank you for making this thread . I saw a while back , before the creation of this account , a thread titled something like : `` [ WP ] Scientists in the 90 's discovered heaven somewhere in space , but for some reason , decided not to announce it to the world . '' <newline> <newline> I wanted so badly to write a short story to that prompt , but the thread was long dead before I could write up a decent story . So that is the plot I am going by .

1,"*An excerpt from an idea I had called the Gold and Crimson Anthology . * <newline> <newline> The cough tore at the inside of the general 's throat . His age has fought against him for Cycles . He was weaker , but it had to take the combination of his age , injuries , and disease to really drag him down . <newline> <newline> He struggled to lift the quill . The arthritis stacking anvil after anvil atop his wrist . <newline> <newline> He breathed . The general felt his age turn back , reversing years of turmoil and war . He was only buying time . <newline> <newline> He wrote his will furiously . Trying to get everything down , especially his replacement . The old man was a widower , and all of his sons perished in war . <newline> <newline> Calories drained . The biomancy using 10 times the amount of energy required to write the letter . But even if he had resisted its use , his passing would happen at the signing of will . No matter what . He was just getting it over with . <newline> <newline> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <newline> <newline> Heat stabbed at the back of the lone infantrymen . He struggled to climb the dune . Sanding tumbling down , trying to bring him down with them . His planted spear prevented so . <newline> <newline> `` Tsarin ! '' A voice cried . <newline> <newline> The soldier glanced at the calling of his name . His younger brother reached out towards him , trying to say on the hill . Tsarin reached as well , trying to give aid . But the blade of a bastard sword impaled the young boy . Frozen for only a moment , he then proceeded to fall into the golden sea below him . Accepted by gravity . <newline> <newline> Tsarin looked up . Gold plate towered above him . A long crimson plume blew in the wind . It was meters long , whipping those who stood in the way of it 's velvety weight . The Capital General . <newline> <newline> It 's been years since the old General passed away , and Oriah had replaced him . <newline> <newline> The infantryman growled . Jumping up he foolishly lunged his spear at the side of the golden armor . It deflected harmlessly , causing Tsarin to stumble and the General to backhand . <newline> <newline> The soldier flew half way down the mountain . Head pointing south , he saw the two Suns in his blurred vision . First time in a month . The two stars grew closer each day . And they starred like the eyes of a beast , peering into Tsarin 's soul . <newline> <newline> And off his head went . Down the hill it tumbled , only to be accepted by gravity . Just like his younger brother before . <newline> <newline> ~~~~~~~~~~~ <newline> <newline> The shade hide the Capital General from the Suns . The golden year ended and the crimson began . The weight of Oriah 's golden feet cracked the soft ground below them . Troops followed not far behind . <newline> <newline> Entering the oasis , jungle isthmus with a sea of sand , they were greeted by the Western General . <newline> <newline> `` Welcome back to camp Gener- '' Before the man could finish , he was interrupted by the commanding voice of Oriah . <newline> <newline> `` Spare me the greeting . I need to get out of this armor , *then* we can talk on the turnout of the battle . '' <newline> <newline> The Western General blinked before backing away . `` Then so be it , '' he scoffed . He exited the clearing . Be followed by not only *his* troops , but Oriah 's as well . <newline> <newline> Starting with the helmet , the general opened it along its vertical hinge . <newline> <newline> Her lengthy crimson hair fell around her shoulders . Most people assumed her hair to be a plume , but it was apart of her more than her armor . <newline> <newline> She refused to cut it . The last time she did so was after she became Capital General , and that was a full shave . <newline> <newline> She removed each piece . Starting from her gauntlets , all the way to her boots . Soon she was free from the oven . <newline> <newline> The cloth clung against her muscular , yet curvaceous figure , soaked in sweat from the hours of heat , toil , and fighting . Removing it as well , Oriah 's pale skin was now exposed to the full coldness of the shade . <newline> <newline> Her captain left her a bag , which lay limp beside her . Removing its contents , she took the clothing from inside and redressed , now wearing a blouse and trousers . After finally putting on standard boots , she walked towards the new camp , tying up her long hair . <newline> <newline> As she entered , some of her soldiers rush to put the armor she left back in the transport . <newline> <newline> The camp was small . Not even close to the size of a *real* war camp . Soldiers saluted when she passed , some of them not even her 's , though they looked rather reluctant to do so . <newline> <newline> Finally entering the Western General 's tent , she immediately heard the man say `` Just leave the drink on the seat , my dear '' <newline> <newline> `` I would not , my lord '' she spoke , sitting down on the very seat the general requested the tea to be on . <newline> <newline> Now that general realized who he was now talking to , he rushed all but one servant , a young scribe girl who could not possibly be any older than 15 , out of the tent . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , the matters on the skirmish '' he began to say with the young scribe scribbling away at her parchment , `` We did mighty well crushing the rebels under- '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . Yes *I* did mighty fine , Shjavaz , it was quite easy subduing a small band of people armed with sticks . Remind me why it took you so long alone before you called me ? '' <newline> <newline> Shjavaz stammered . `` Wh-why they were using rather advance tactics for just a 'small band of- ' '' <newline> <newline> `` What tactics ? Running straight at us ? That was one of the worse bands I saw . And I ca n't seem to recall seeing anyone from your company at the skirmish . I 'm pretty sure I saw most of your men hungover on my way to your tent . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you see ... They '' <newline> <newline> She slammed his desk causing the scribe , and even Shjavaz to jump . `` Were giving you a hard time , or were just bothering you as you and your troops bounced around from brothel to brothel . <newline> <newline> `` Despite my feminine appearance , I 'm not some war maid going around cleaning up your messes and problems . May I remind you that I outrank you ? I 'm the Capital 's guardian . I simply do not have the time to help you swat a fly ! <newline> <newline> `` I was told there was a full scale rebellion here , not a bunch of citizens tired of having military occupation and soldiers ' using their job as leverage to fiddle around with every woman within an 1800 mile radius . You are the protector of this area , not the dictator . Now . I must ask you . What are you personally doing outside the capital ? '' <newline> <newline> With the Western general sitting there dumb , she turned and left , preparing to pull her troops out , and back to the capital , to report the Western General 's unruly behavior to King .

1,"Sunlight is leaking through the trees , hitting my eyes , which in turn caused them to flinch . I blinked many times , only to shake my head and sigh . The bed of leaves that clung to the wooden limbs did a fine job of keeping the warmth out , but I still found myself sweating . Perhaps I was nervous . The forest was scary , after all , despite the friendly green color that inhabits it . I always seem to forget why I decide to take a stroll here , and especially this deep . <newline> <newline> There 's fresh morning dew on a few pebbles and flowers , which led me to a pond , the slow creek depositing there . When I poke my finger through the water , colorful koi gather , tickling me with their curiosity . When a shrill voice erupts from beyond , I keep moving . <newline> <newline> Thankfully , I had come across an old cobblestone path . It confused me for many reasons . For one , I had never seen this path before , but I had been here a many time . Must have fled my field of vision . It was also still so put together , very few stones astray . But still , flora and moss sprouted through it , alerting me that this trail was not as fresh as one may think . My eyes followed it deeper down , until it was hidden , only a few beams of light showing me the way . <newline> <newline> As curiosity would drive me , for I have already gotten this far , and I , of course , would take a journey only along this way—as if it were almost inviting—down the path that seemed to have no return . At least , I knew I would n't turn around . Just a few steps in , my shoe feels a foreign object beneath it , something I have not stepped on before , something that did not belong where I was . Quickly , I lift my foot , only to be washed with relief . A tiny brass key , too tiny to forget , had wedged its way between two stones . It was covered in a familiar moss , and I decided it would be best to take it with me , despite my mind nagging me to leave it be . Juggling the key for another few moments between my hands , I decided to put it in my pocket , opposite of the one that held my pocket watch , chain still dangling to remind me of his presence . <newline> <newline> Gradually , it appears that my journey is getting dimmer . The more I go , the less that there is to guide me . My heart flutters in its cage , and I hold onto my vest for some form of comfort . I ca n't see the trail now , but I can feel it . Winding and turning , leading me further and further through the void . I am aware that I am completely surrounded , but being so dark and how quickly I move , it seems as though I saw stars . My feet move faster , my hands tremble . I 'm losing myself , I feel it , yet I ca n't feel the rest of me . <newline> <newline> But at one last angle , I curve over it , and everything comes to a stop . I find the light . It guides me to follow it down with my eyes , for it 's pooled on a tiger , his fur creamy and white , like he was bloodless . Without fury . His jowls twitched every few moments , and I could tell he was fighting for each breath . A spear , its handle wrapped in worn leather straps , thin strings with decorative beads hanging off of it , shot through his chest , strung through his ribs . Every breath , more red would stain his achromatic coat . When I moved towards him , he would flinch , attempting to jerk up at me , causing me to bounce back with a loss of air . Swallowing a thickness that rest in my mouth , I took one step forward , one stroke of my shoe across the cold earth . With two palms pressed against it , my fingers wrapped around the leather-clad hilt , and I dislocated it as quickly as a could . His languid body had enough strength to roar , booming from his chest in one quick thunderous strike . I fell , so taken aback , my legs out in front of me , the lance in both hands , still . Thrusting it through the fabric of my pack , I decided to keep it , suspended there as my own . I pay the new hole no mind , staring at him for a long moment . He mystified me . Was he asking me for help , or just not denying it ? <newline> <newline> With the little strength I had , I lifted the white beast . <newline> <newline> Each heavy footstep , now , I attempted to listen above his labored breathing , wanting so badly to hear that creek . Where it began . Following the sounds , I could feel the rushed rushed water pulsing beneath me . Again , I was winding and turning , yet this gave me no path . I had to use my intuition , for it was all I had , moving as quickly as I could with him in my hands . My eyes danced through the darkness frantically , feverishly , my teeth grinding in the wake of night . <newline> <newline> I found the clearing . A large basin presented itself to me , naturally carved out on the inside of a cave . Stalactites dripped from above me , and when I looked up , many vines hung down , flowers blooming from them , a soft glow emitting . My presence brought peace , and I could tell when I looked at him . I choked back my emotions , stumbled to my knees , and slowly extended my trembling arms to place him down in the water , his breathing near a halt . Running my palm over him one last time , I felt his final breath . He dissolved , then , all that 's left being a white cloud that floated up until it disappeared . <newline> <newline> I kneeled there for a long time , wiping away my tears . Mustering up the courage to stand , my glassy eyes fogged . I was hit with a wall of dysphoria , the clouds in my eyes refusing to float like he did . I rubbed them until I saw stars , and when I blinked myself back into consciousness , the world seemed to change . My knees wobbled like my mother 's aspic . Taking one step , the earth seemed to quake beneath me . Another and another , and the earth became lighter , like I was gliding over its domain . I found another clearing beyond my feeling of melancholy . This one was different ; it was wide and free , full of sunflowers . I wanted to run through them , but my body would not permit me . The night sky taunted me , and I stood , staring towards the center . <newline> <newline> He was there . <newline> <newline> In a shroud of light , he was there . <newline> I moved towards him , feeling it pierce my skin , heating me with each touch . He became something more . Even when I watched him leave me , he came back . I shall learn to never be as I was . <newline> <newline> My love had been waiting .

1,"It all began in the 56 year of our Surek . When the Rustafars were a tribal group of hunter and gatherers . With a population of no more than 50 they wandered from place to place seeking refuge and a place to honor Surek . Their leader was named L'naak Odonnel . <newline> L'naak was a man of great cunning and a brilliant tactician . One night he had a vision ( no doubt bestowed upon him by Surek ) of a promised land known as Tavainia . However a great peoples already lived their , known as the Gyptonites . L'naak rallied his fighting men , no more than 36 men , and proceeded to Tavainia 's border . To meet him the Gyptonites had assembled 2000 fighting men and 300 chariots . L'naak was not afraid , for a vision from Nick Cage had appeared to him the night before the battle : an account from L'naak of his vision before the battle in late memoirs `` It was cold , I felt a warm wind rush all about me , it made my skin tingle and raised gooseflesh all over my body . I did n't know what to think until a very warm presence entered into my tent . It was Kele ( Surek 's messenger ) , I knew it from that masculine , angular face , to those rippling muscles and ample chest hair ; to that warm voice that lapped against my ears like some sweet nectar of the gods . He told me , 'You need n't fear for the battle to come . For I am with you , my rod and staff , they comfort you , I will deliver the Gyptonites into your hand , and you will strike them down and leave none alive , neither man nor woman nor child nor beast of the field , all you must strike down and burn their entrails as a pleasing aroma to Surek . ' With that the Almighty Cage caressed my nipple and vanished , leaving a lingering scent that smelled akin to that of stewing onions . '' L'naak told his men that Surek would deliver the Gyptonites into their hands , he had all the men prepare their bodies for the battle : that is to say they all bathed , sacrificed a young ewe to Surek , bedaubed their bodies in green warpaint , and began to chant . <newline> <newline> Even though L'naak was promised a great victory , he still left nothing to chance . He laid his plans accordingly . The Great Battle took place on the plains of Wesfolia ( an area still in Tavainia that is hallowed and much visited ) which was a vast expanse of sweeping vegetation that culminated into a high summit that dominated the surrounding area . Here the Gyptonites drew up their battle line , with the Chariots on the summit and the infantry guarding the slopes . L'naak , vastly outnumbered , did the unthinkable : he split his forces three ways . With the guard of his house about him ( 12 in total ) he proceeded up the middle of the plain towards the slope . The remaining groups ( 12 each ) went to the extreme left and right flanks , but remained hidden in the dense foliage . As L'naak fearlessly advanced upon the formidable Gyptonites he offered a silent prayer to Surek , that he may honor his ancestors and win a great victory . The Chariots of the Gyptonites , led by the King himself , bethought the lone force easy prey and rushed down the slopes at a furious pace . L'naak 's armament consisted of a cuirass of burnished steel links , a lofty helm with outstretched raven 's wings , a shield , plated in gold and dazzlingly bright , a broadsword of the hardest iron , and a spear . <newline> <newline> This Spear was no ordinary weapon , it was the Spear of Antiquity . Made from the bones of a mighty sea creature and tipped with Mithril : a substance sharper than steel , colder than ice , more splendid than silver , a metal of adamant . This weapon was carried by all the leaders of the Rustafars since time-immemorial and it was whispered that whoever held it was invincible . <newline> <newline> As the Chariots of the Gyptonites bore down on L'naak with ever increasing haste , he raised his spear , that Spear of Indomitable Might , and threw a mighty throw . A throw that had never and will never be seen in history again . The Spear soared through the air more than 600 yards and split asunder the breastplate of the Gyptonite King , it passed through his heart and continued into his armor-bearer , killing them both . As the Chariots stormed upon the men of the Rustafar Tribe , L'naak climbed upon the King 's Chariot and hewed the head off of the King 's body . He impaled this upon the Spear of Antiquity , and surmounted it upon the chariot . He exhorted his men to commandeer chariots , which the did , and turned them upon the enemy . Some troops displayed significant valor and their tales have been recounted here `` Upon L'naak 's left was his chief lieutenant , Aramais , who 's might was so known that it made the Pairenthians tremble , was beset by 7 charioteers . He drew his sword shimmering from its sheath and stacked about his person bodies upon bodies of his enemies , only pausing to draw breath and wipe the gore from his blade '' Such was the valor of those men ! But even so the battle would have gone ill were it not for L'naak 's master planning . The Chariots were thrown down in ruin and the infantry pressed hard upon L'naak and his men , it was then that L'naak rose to his lips an Ox 's horn , an ox from the great troll-fells of Wendrividia where ice is more common than the grass , and blew such a blast upon that recheat that it burst asunder in his hand . That was the signal . <newline> <newline> Down from the slopes came his painted warriors , they hurled themselves upon the backs of their surprised foes just as L'naak led his captured Chariots in on their front . How many were killed there ? None know . There was a great rout and much wreck and slaughter up to the very river of Turmain were the Gyptonites where slaughtered in water that had turned red with their blood . L'naak had captured over 200 Gyptonites and killed thousands more . He and his army , suffering only 8 casualties ( 2 of which had died ) , marched upon the city of the Gyptonites and threw down the gates , entered into it , and left not a soul alive . A great burning was seen for miles around ; the remnants of the Gyptonites ' great city . <newline> <newline> Upon the Field of Westfolia a great victory feast was held upon the summit of Mount Mindollian ( the very summit where our great capital is now ) . There L'naak sacrificed the 200 captives to Surek , burning their entrails as pleasing aromas , and then he feasted . Such a feast had never been seen until the Horn of Building was drunk upon the completion of Conair , the great fortress on Mindollian 's summit ( which our capital is named after ) . <newline> <newline> And thus the Nation of Tavainia was founded , the Rustafars became Tavainians , and Surek our Lord and Kele his prophet protected our peoples and made us a prosperous and great nation . L'naak was renamed Renaak Septim , which means 'Blessed and Victorious One ' . Our currency , the Septim , still carries his effigy to this day .

1,"Choices <newline> <newline> Jons days consisted of a series of choices . Choices he ’ d made every day for the past and choices he would make for the foreseeable future . Most of his choices were small . But he delighted in them . Apple or banana ? Oatmeal or bran ? Milk or water ? His breakfast was the first choice . And then off to work . He worked nine to five . Nine more or less . Five sharp . Immutable . Then the drive home . The radio blaring some news about a war or a fight or a something in a distant land he ’ d never seen and half imagined didn ’ t exist at all . Then it was off to a friends . Sometimes they ’ d swim sometimes talk and play cards then to bed . Jons days consisted of a series of choices . Logical . Calculated . Efficient and correct . <newline> <newline> Jon ’ s life didn ’ t alter much . He knew what he was going to do . He had a plan . He would work and work and work until he got his pension . A nice sizeable pension . A pension to be proud of . Then he would retire . And golf . Or swim . Or sleep . Maybe all three . <newline> <newline> “ Castle inc has a very robust benefits package ” Sherri from HR quipped . “ We have a sizable reimbursement plan for healthy living that comes at the end of the year . If you exercise , eat right , sleep enough , you know be healthy , then you ’ re eligible. ” The fan droned . The coffee was stale and in a paper cup . Two small brown rings flanked it on either side . Jon fiddled with his although he ’ d long since absorbed its contents . His knee bobbed up and down like a jackhammer . Thirty minutes . <newline> <newline> The deer ’ s neck shot up as it turned to look at me . Eyes wide on either side of it ’ s head . It ’ s ears pointed skyward . Crickets hummed . A crack . The deer ’ s ears swiveled towards it . Another crack . It ’ s head swiveled now swiftly . A buck comes into view around a pine . A coocoo calls . The buck freezes staring straight at me . It has at least 13 points . Huge buck . One leg half lifted up it stares at me then the deer . As if we ’ d just been just been caught in the act . With a jolt it bounces away . It ’ s loping almost comical bouncing contrasting with it ’ s proud shoulders and muscled flank . The deer already gone . Just the crickets and the pine left . <newline> <newline> … pensions are as well a viable option for those who invest their 401k . Really we don ’ t put enough in . Coprorate inc has been very very generous in matching any investment up to 10 % for the first five years and then up to 12 % after . Really it is a very competitive company in regards to benefits . Any questions ? ” Tap tap tap tap . Fingers clicked on table tops . <newline> <newline> Wednesday . Then Thursday . That ’ s when he ’ d really feel it . Pushing down on him like a gray ooze . Not so much on friday or saturday . Those days he knew it would be over soon . But thursday . Thursday it would never end . <newline> <newline> The fire crackling happily comes into view . The teepee closely follows . The dogs get bigger as they get closer . Three black one brown . Barking manic happy barking . They follow me to the fire . Jump on my legs . I tousle their warm fluffy hair . The pup bites at my hand . I hit it and reprimand . It rolls over gayly toungue wags out . I pull out the meat they know I have and throw it . They run for the scraps . Big grey gets the majority as usual . His scar over his left eye looks healed . I sit into the bag of furs and skins . Big grey comes over rests his heavy head on my thigh . Warm . I put my hand behing his ears and scratch . He closes his good eye . The smell of smoke washes over us . <newline> <newline> “ Obviously pets are not allowed at work Jon. ” Sherri said slightly impatiently . “ Think of the effect that would have on others . Really I ’ m shocked to hear you ask . You know pets have been highly regulated lately . If you feel a need for a service animal or emotional support animal the proper paperwork can be filed with the office of disabilities . Otherwise I see no need for such a drastic measure I mean really . If we all can barely get along with one another then what ’ s a mutt going to fix. ” Jon nodded in agreement that obviously wasn ’ t shared and turned to leave . The lines of cubicles stretched for miles in each direction . Each illuminated by a phosphorescent bulb . The walkway was of course automatic . Only the best for valued employees . <newline> <newline> The mountain path stretches upward . Brown dirt and large boulders flanked on either side by aspens and blackberry bushes . The meadow would be up about half a days journey . Hopefully this time the cougar wouldn ’ t growl when we got there . The deerskin canteen sloshes with cool crisp water . About half full . Haunches start to twinge with effort . Three other deer skin clad companions keep a steady pace in front . Eyes trace the stick sharpened for hours last night to perfection . The bow made by our best craftsman and the pouches full of jerky and dried fruit . The dogs bark from behind . Maybe they found a squirrel . <newline> <newline> Office sounds filled the floor . Telephones rang . Men ran . Women in skirts sat to gossip and flirt . Nothing really needed doing . So nothing really got done . It ’ s just who did the least the best that got recognition . The screens were filled with pointless information . Funny videos and pictures . Jon sat in his seat . Sharpened his pencil with his pencil sharpener . And opened his computer . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Everyone thinks the bad guy wants to blow up the world or end civilization or some other far fetched plan to upset the status quo . That ’ s stupid . I AM the status quo . I don ’ t want you to leave . I want you here . Here I ’ m in charge . Here I control you . I don ’ t know what happens in the great abyss . I never have . So why make more people go ? What if it ’ s really a release ? What if it ’ s a void ? No I ’ d rather you were here . I enjoy your struggle . It gives me meaning . Gives me life . I ’ m not too proud to admit that subjegation is my marrow . Your submission my opiate . Let ’ s stop talking now . I have things to do. ” <newline> <newline> Jon might have been escorted out of Mr. Mann ’ s office at that point . We might just as well have left of our own accord . <newline>

1,"Vengeance Twisted <newline> <newline> “ They look like one big sausage , a big bulbous one . You ever made sausage Fritz ? ” <newline> <newline> Fritz had been staring at the huddled mass of disheveled , hopeless people shuffling into the ‘ shower ’ for the last half-hour . He did n't look back . <newline> <newline> “ No. ” There was a long pause . “ I 've eaten it though… ” He turned around and stared into Schwinstone ’ s eyes . <newline> <newline> “ Now I 'll never eat it again. ” <newline> <newline> “ What 's his problem huh ? ” asked Friedrich Schwinstone , as he absently , and self-importantly rubbed his SS armband . He always did this , the others had noticed , at the ‘ cleanses ’ . <newline> <newline> Schwinstone loved eating sausage and making it . His family has been in the sausage business since the 30 Years war had killed most of the men in Bavaria . It had been a Schwinstone who had bravely made sausage again . When he was not being beaten or berated by his father , Schwinstone loved the oozing meats , loved to control them , loved to beat and punish his stupid little bruder when he made mistakes with the equipment . <newline> <newline> Schwinstone started to tell the men about the different varieties of sausage . One of them interrupted , joking that these Jewish sausages were about to burst their casings . He was a dummkopf thought Schwinstone . They were going to use the last of the Zyklon-B today , then the other bursting methods would be tried and studied tomorrow . <newline> <newline> Tomorrow was the officially sanctioned opening of Camp Geheimnis . Schwinstone had been told so by the officer who had visited a month ago . New techniques and new methods were to be tried in order to expedite the Final Solution , as well as test weaponry for use on the Eastern Front . <newline> <newline> The men watched the doors close behind the condemned . Vermin , muttmuttered one of them . Others looked at him out of the corner of their eyes , making sure not to make eye contact . It was the act that was horrifying . Before they were alive and disgusting Jews , after they were just dead and heavy Jew 's . Their shoes usually smelled horrible too . So the men were slightly relieved when a slight hiss became audible . <newline> <newline> After awhile it stopped and silence reigned . Fritz was the first to move . The others followed him and did as he did . The bodies were dragged one by one to the pits and deposited unceremoniously . Each man looked with longing at the mess houses where they ate afterwards , and washed their hands with a vengeance . It was hungry work . <newline> <newline> This time was like every time , thought Fritz : horrible , depressing , and exhausting . As he dragged another body from the center of the room , a small hiccup made his heart jump into his mouth . He looked where it had come from but there was no movement . No need to be nervous he thought , the bodies always made strange noises so soon after they had been gassed . <newline> <newline> He looked one last time to be sure and almost threw up . Tears came to his eyes unbidden as he tried and failed to look into the bright eyes of a small boy with black hair . He trembled and tries to compose himself , but the eyes just watched him . They were full of pain , more than he could bear to see . <newline> <newline> Fritz continued to drag his body and told himself it was a hallucination , the stress and self-loathing finally getting to him . A scream ended this small fantasy . Schwinstone had come in , pointed at the head , and screamed as it rose on a body still very much alive . <newline> <newline> “ Someone kill it , kill the thing ” he said as he reached for the MP40 he was too lazy to carry and always left on his desk . <newline> <newline> “ How is it alive ? ” one of the guards said as he raised his MP40 and prepared to kill the freak . The little boy did n't give the man a chance . He brought his clasped hands from behind his back and delicately pointed a little pistol and fired it at the man with the MP40 . A small dot oozed blood from the forehead he had hit , and then it was mayhem . <newline> <newline> The other guards opened up on the little boy but he was too quick . Scrambling and dodging among the jungle of limbs and swollen faces , he made it to the doors and shut them . The guards were too rattled to realize what had transpired so quickly , so impossibly . Fritz was the first to realize what the little demon had done . <newline> <newline> Schwinstone assured him though that the last of the Zyklon-B had been used . They would just have to wait for someone to come and let them out . So they all huddled along the walls trying not to touch the bodies . <newline> <newline> “ They 'll kill the tyke and let us out soon . Once we hear gunshots it wo n't be long ” said Schwinstone . <newline> <newline> A few small reports echoed and then there was silence that never broke until Fritz looked at Schwinstone with utter contempt . <newline> <newline> “ You scheisskopf Schwinstone , why would you keep the second set of doors locked ? ” <newline> <newline> “ it 's more efficient to only open the ones closest to the pits. ” protested Schwinstone . <newline> <newline> Schwinstone confidently asserted again the boy would be shot and they would be let out . He did n't know why it was taking the others so long but it could n't be long now until they came for them . But they did n't come and the wait lasted . <newline> <newline> Outside the ‘ showers ’ David , the little boy , had done as his father had told him to . In the bunks the night before his father had whispered into his ear . <newline> <newline> “ David we are going to God soon . He loves us , always believe that. ” <newline> <newline> “ More than you love me ? ” David had asked in a small voice , almost swallowed up by the grime and pressed bodies and stench of the bunkhouse . <newline> <newline> His father , a man who had cried tears of joy at David 's Bar Mitzfah as his son read the Torah , who had suffered being beaten repeatedly for wearing his yarmulke long after the ban and the ghettos , a god-fearing man , did not hesitate : <newline> <newline> “ Not even God , David , loves you as much as I love you right now . So you must listen to me very carefully because I know I must go soon to be with your mother and sister , but I think there is a way for you to join us with more stories to tell of the the place the world may become long after tomorrow. ” <newline> <newline> As his father had made sure they shuffled their way to the center of the room , as he had held his hand and stood resolutely when the gas came , and as he had limply lay atop his son in the middle of the pile of bodies , David had remembered and done what he had been told . <newline> <newline>

1,"Too late to the party but here goes : <newline> <newline> They were plain bus tickets . The ones they print out , the more modern-looking one than those shabby pieces of paper they previously handed out . White and thermal now . They used to be blue . <newline> <newline> That night , I was feeling a wee bit like the colour , and grumpy , yet you had great energy like the biggest star at day . I wanted to keep my dour mood going all throughout the night because I wanted to be a bitch to you at least once , but your playfulness creeped in and just melted the icecaps surrounding me . <newline> <newline> We were supposed to grab a bite but forgot it was Sunday . My favourite Chinese restaurant was closed when we got there by foot a bit too hurriedly , ( which was very unneccessary ) due to the fact that we were hoping to catch the last train ride because it was such a pain to travel using any other means . <newline> <newline> Now , what happened next completely disarmed my defences -- witnessing a fully developed mature adult , a man by all rights , aged 31 , impulsively grabbing his woman 's hand and making her race for the underground stairway , galloping down step-by-step , like a deranged schoolchild all the while never letting go of her . I could 've lost my footing and hurt myself . But your spirit of carelessness amused me , I could n't hold character . <newline> <newline> I wanted to die of laughter there and then . I hated you . <newline> <newline> And then the daydreams kicked in . You were talking and eating but my mind was wandering off , wishing that all my favourite restaurants were always closed so I 'd get more of these moments . We 'd get crappy food and I probably would n't give one damn about it . I wanted to pretend to be the meanest female-bodied individual so you 'd aim to please me . Amuse me . Then I can snort like a fat pig and be childishly happy with no regard for anybody else except for that one person . Fingers at you . I wondered , what you would do next time ? Would you put my life in not-so-serious peril ? Is it the thrill , the unpredictability I 'm looking for ? Not the actual company ? Did I have a uninteresting childhood to find myself gleeful at juvenile shit you pull ? <newline> <newline> Nevertheless , I took our moments in . I drank it like Kool-Aid . I made sure I wo n't forget . I still remember it , in slow motion . Might not be as accurate as the real deal , but that 's how prose is . A little extra . We give it a little colour because of our fondness for it . Rosier and rosier as the time passes . <newline> <newline> So I continue with the story . We worked jobs . We had our own lives . We really were n't ... together . This time life got in the way , and we had no choice whatsoever but to hop on a bus to the closest train station and head home . Until our eventual parting . You paid for the damage , and promptly asked me to watch your skilled hands -- fingers , closely . <newline> <newline> `` See this ? '' <newline> <newline> Step by step , you folded the ticket to a heart-shaped origami and placed it in my hand . <newline> <newline> What was I supposed to do ? <newline> <newline> `` Cheer up , '' you encouraged . And I did . It 's the little things . It 's always the small gestures , my former love . They impress me the most , however cheesy they seem to be . <newline> <newline> I could n't look at you in the eye . I was feeling embarrassed for myself . For feeling warm . All I was supposed to be capable of was to feel randy . My mind was just about jumping your bones . That was me . Fuzzy was n't me . Corny was n't the usual you too . We were out of sync with our normal selves , but it felt just right . Nothing was wrong about coochy-coochy . Just this time . I did n't overthink it out . <newline> <newline> You grabbed my chin playfully and that was it . I was still staring at the marvel in front of my eyes . Scene ends here . Fade to black . I could add that I hugged and kissed you before I hopped off , but that 's a story you hear everywhere . I 'd like to fantasise about giving you bite marks instead . Did n't happen so I 'm not adding that . <newline> <newline> Whatever passed between us that night , I can not say for sure . But what I do know is that I declared that I was keeping that flimsy ticket for good . <newline> <newline> Now . Would you have scorned me , back then when we had stars for eyes , when you seemed affectionate , for losing all my possessions , the ones that meant something to us , even if I tried my very best to hold on to them ? Because I was careless ? <newline> <newline> We often talked about how I had no sense of belonging anywhere , in jest , with drama , and copious amounts of tears from self-pity . <newline> <newline> That 's never changed . <newline> <newline> But one thing I knew from the very beginning . I did not possess you . I had none of the keys to whatever you kept locked away , out of reach from most people . <newline> <newline> I misplaced that heart you made . We do n't talk anymore . I burned the bridge off to save what was left of my sanity . If we will , will you believe the excuse that it was made of paper and small that 's why managed to ? It was easy , not that I set out to get it done . Although my fully-fleshed out , pumping blood , constricting heart , I carry it everywhere . You still occupy a small space in there . Guess what ... It 's not the most effortless thing imaginable . <newline> <newline> You never belonged to me . People can not be possessed by people . They are not things . But I wanted us to belong together . Special to me , special to you . Linda Blair , alright . <newline> <newline> And yet . How come it still felt that I had so much grief over losing something that I never owned in the first place ? <newline> <newline> I had no illusions on how we meant to each other , or so I 'd like to convince myself . The truth is , I thought the concept of us would never get old . The bus tickets used to be blue . Things change . People , feelings ... <newline> <newline> The reality was that I deluded myself into thinking we were the exception to the rule . <newline> <newline> I 'm now on my way home writing this , the tickets in my sweaty palms . I tried folding the piece of paper the same way earlier . It did n't look anything special . I look at the stranger across my seat who has been staring at me for a good while , and gave him a sad smile .

1,"It was gigantic . It was n't possible- the size , the scope . Zilla could only look at pieces of it , could only take in so much at once , with the colluding shapes and impossible angles , the colors mixing to form combinations that should make black but did n't . It seemed not only to extend in physical dimension but in all dimensions . In time . It moved and it stood where it always had and always would . Always before her . Always in this place and yet moving from it at once . She thought , looking at it , that all the size of everything , the conglomerate mass of everything that was could n't possibly make up this much , and yet this was one entity . One monster . Or maybe this was all monsters , and all monsters were part of this one , together in this one monstrous being were all the evils it had ever wrought in one . Scales , tentacles , ghosts , mermaids , the rising tide . This something , this enormity , she could n't fathom it . She found herself forgetting as she saw , her feeble mind dumping understanding as it rolled in , and with each rush of knowledge came the crash and the terror , and then it was pulled back out from her , exposing her raw and naked sandy shore even as her senses brought in more of the horror . In the rotating , dark core of the planet was and always would be this same perpetual wheel . The beast that was always destroying humanity . <newline> <newline> Stumbling backward - was there still a backward ? - Zilla gasped for breath . Did the thing see her ? It could crush her without effort , but would it touch something as small as her ? How could something so big concern itself with a victim so small ? But her very existence seemed to enrage the thing - how dare there be something else , something that the monster did not encompass . She needed to get away , but was there a place in time , in all of history or of the future that this thing would not be there for ? Behind it all , the thing rumbled , moving with aching slowness , leaving devastation in its forever-wake . The sea lapped the stone on which she stood . The vast black water from which this unfathomable landscape and its colossal inhabitant rose moved beneath the dark sky , back and back until they met at a greenish , glowing horizon . <newline> <newline> The thing began to turn . It was minutes before Zilla noticed its vaguely humanoid face tilted downward to her , upon its massive domed , glistening head . Its mouth opened , but no sound came out . Instead , from all around her , chanting song rose from the depths , creating a picture out of sound , showing her where water met rock . At her feet , where there had been nothing but dark , wet stone , there was an idol . Around her , blue arms rose from the water around the perimeter of the lonely rock , holding idols in their dripping , wrinkled and webbed fingers . A small likeness , if it could be captured , of the great creature . An idol so small that she could take it in at once . She could understand it , and hold it , and it made her less scared . So manageable . Her white fingers reached out to the figure , but she did n't move towards it . A meter or so of darkness between them , but the idol might have been a mile away . She might take a lifetime and not get to grasp it and feel safe . But she wanted it , wanted a grip on this little big thing . This focus kept her from looking at the real monster , still enormous , still destroying , though , and she steeled herself within that focus before lifting one foot a hair off the ground and moving it almost imperceptibly closer to the figure . As if magnetized , her foot became completely still again when she put it down and it resisted her when she tried to move it any more . She could feel the pull now , all over her body , to the floor . She decided not to fight , but to crawl , instead of walk the few feet to the small stone copy of the beast before her . The same force pulling her to the ground seemed to be draining tears from her eyes . She cried so hard she couldn ’ t see , so hard it was as though she was under water - blinking through a sea of her own tears . Her lungs could barely keep up with the sobs , and she gasped for air whenever she could , still lowering herself onto all fours with a slowness that seemed a contradiction to the strength of the pull . A magnet being dragged to metal through molasses . <newline> <newline> Zilla ’ s knees and palms came in contact with the stone at the same moment , and she didn ’ t wait to feel the same lock that she ’ d felt with her feet . She slid forward , extending her body as far as possible , her fingertips straining . She needed the figure , she needed to fight this thing , not that thing , not the parent , the root - just the idol . <newline> <newline> When she touched it , her mind blew open . She could feel the rock below her but she could see only a storm . Her sisters , drowning on algae collections . Her pod , so small , being searched by guards regularly for algae hoarding . The girls who starved , because they missed one quota . Images flickered past her too fast to connect with . She only glimpsed personal struggles , she saw arms pinned down , legs opened , meal tickets issued . She saw children growing inside of people , who screamed in pain but then smiled as they bled , and died . Zilla heard crying . The storm spun around her , and she could see lines connecting them . She could see the algae , the purification tablets , the machines . She saw the tree of Command , could see the billions at the bottom , working and dying , and she saw the few grow fewer as she rose , and she could see those at the top dying too , but being replaced and replaced . <newline> <newline> She could do this . She could take up this idol and she could win this war , she saw it so clearly . But - the stone which she still felt beneath her knees , wet and smooth , rumbled . The beast was moving . It had given this to her - a winnable war against its image - she was so grateful it weakened her , and she flattened against the stone , lowering herself before the beast with the idol in hand . The beast ’ s face disappeared , maybe it had turned away , or perhaps it had never even had a face , and had never turned to her , but the chanting from the ledges grew louder , and the blue , webbed fingers waved their idols almost frantically . Their winnable wars .

1,"Mike was having a hard time keeping his eyes open . It was a lazy Saturday evening and he was watching the NFL playoffs with his wife . The couch was extra comfortable , especially in the reclined position . Mike closed his eyes and began to let his mind rest . Sleep crept closer to him , so much that he could feel a dream coming . `` Honey , '' said his wife , Chelsea . `` Would you like some coffee ? I 'm about to make a pot , decafe of course . '' `` Yeah , sure , '' said Mike . His wife got up and walked into the kitchen . `` You know tomorrow we have to go to church , my parents are expecting us . '' `` Yeah , I know , '' said Mike . He was never really a believer , but Chelsea 's mother was going to be baptised . `` Please try to make it seem like you 're not hating every second of it . We will just be there for the service and she will be baptised afterwards . '' `` I 'll try ... it 's just , you know how I hate sitting there , singing songs , listening to the preacher , '' said Mike . `` I know honey , but I will make it up to you by making you your favorite dinner tomorrow . '' `` Thanks babe , you know that I love you because of the cooking really , '' Mike said jokingly . Chelsea peaked around the doorway that led into the kitchen , '' Well someone is n't getting coffee or burgers tomorrow , '' she said . Mike laughed , he loved their little back and forths . `` I 'm sorry honey , you know I love you , '' said Mike . Chelsea walked out of the kitchen with two cups of coffee and sat down next to Mike . She kissed him on the cheek and handed him his cup . They then talked about the plans again for tomorrow and other ideas like what to do with the gazebo in their backyard . Eventually , night time settled in . Chelsea told Mike she was going to bed . Mike considered it , but told her he would be in a little bit . She left the room to head upstairs and Mike watched the tv , half paying attention and half dozing off . He thought about the football game he was watching. `` Are the Lions going to make it to the super bowl this year ? Hell no , '' Mike thought to himself . Maybe it would be something he would pray about tomorrow , if God did exist . He closed his eyes with a smile at the thought and started to drift asleep . He awoke much later . The cable box said 12:00 . The tv was off for some reason . `` Maybe Chelsea had come down to check on me and turned it off , '' he thought . It would have been very dark , almost pitch black , if not for the moonlight that crept it 's way through his blinds . He slowly dragged himself off the couch and stretched . As he extended his arms , he thought it was weird that his coffee was n't beside his couch on the table anymore . `` Where did it go ? , '' he thought.He decided to investigate the kitchen to get an answer to his curious question . He walked into the kitchen and checked the sink , but nothing was there . The counter was clean too . Mike was trying to decipher the situation when he heard a noise in the living room . `` That 's strange , maybe Chelsea has come back downstairs , '' he thought . He walked into the living room to find someone sitting on the couch . He could n't tell who it was , as the moonlight only made it so bright that he could see a figure in the resounding darkness . He was taken aback at the sight , `` who 's there ? '' asked Mike . He felt like it was n't his wife , no . This figure , this entity , had a dark energy to it . It 's outline looked human , but whatever it was , it was definitely anything but . `` Have a seat , Mike , '' said the being . For some reason , Mike felt compelled to sit , even though his skin was crawling on his back . Mike to a seat on the couch , farthest from the entity . The entity 's head looked staright ahead , it 's face masked from the side Mike was sitting on . `` Maybe a cloak or hood , '' Mike thought . He could n't tell , it was like the being was sucking all of the light that touched it , exuding only darkness . The entity turned it 's head towards Mike , there a smile on it 's face , a sinister smile . Mike examined the face , the only part of the entity 's body that reflected light . It was human esque in shape , but even Mike knew this was no human . `` What the hell are you ? '' asked Mike . The entity let out a chuckle , but there was no joy to be found in it . `` Someone who is interested in you , '' answered the being . `` What do you want from me , '' asked Mike . `` I 've come to tell you that I have a contract on your soul , as well as one on your wife . '' said the being . `` What are you talking about , '' Mike asked , trying to hide the quivering in his voice . `` What does it sound like , '' the entity replied in return . `` I do n't know what you are , but I want you out of here right now , '' demanded Mike . The being flashed it 's lifeless smile , no joy in it 's black eyes , or color in it 's pale white skin . `` How can I leave your house , if I was never here , '' said the being with his revolting smile . All of a sudden , the tv turned on . Mike snapped his head to look at the screen , a reflex since his nerves were screaming at him . He immediately looked back towards the being , but nothing was there . Mike began to hyperventilate . `` What the hell was that , '' he thought . He kept breathing faster and faster . The entity 's smile in his minds eye . He could n't seem to calm down . He tried to move , but felt heavy , like he was being sucked into the couch . He could n't stop breathing so quickly , he started sweating , but felt cold . His eyes started to become heavy , and he fealt lightheaded . He did n't know what was happening . He heard the being 's cold chuckle one last time before he passed out . `` Honey , '' said Chelsea . Mike opened his eyes . He was sitting on the couch , the living room lit by the setting sun . The game was on . `` Would you like some coffee , '' asked Chelsea .

1,"I had this laying around my computer and never had anywhere to post it ... . it 's part one of a three part series . <newline> <newline> <newline> The Watchmaker ’ s Son <newline> _________________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> “ The greatest gift God ever gave us was the naturally perfect rhythm with which his hands molded and shaped the Earth… The rhythm present in all of us : in the beat of our hearts and the time between. ’ <newline> <newline> Jack Dodson sat alone in the eighth pew from the back , just as he did every Sunday . He silently nodded his head in affirmation as Pastor Pound pressed on in his sermon . <newline> <newline> “ In His house , we sit now in awe . Never has there been a more meticulously calculated… ” <newline> <newline> High above the velvet-adorned altar stood John the Baptist , forever idolized in the stained glass artwork that had remained a centerpiece of the Church since its construction a century before . None forgotten , Jesus poised opposite the cross-bearer , standing in ominous guard over the congregation . It must be close to 10:30 , Jack thought , as the red-marked sunlight streaming in from above John ’ s cross hit the empty pew in front of him . His concentration unraveled into anxiety , just as it did every time that seventh seat faded to red . For four years he had sat on that bench with his wife Marianne and his son Chris , and then 13 more with Chris . <newline> <newline> “ Every perceived misstep , every imperfection , are indeed laid in careful following of his instruction. ” <newline> <newline> Sitting inside , Jack could effortlessly tell you the time of day based on the way the sunlight shone through the stained glass windows . This was his craft , a trait perfected in his decades as the town ’ s esteemed watchmaker and devout timekeeper . If burdened , he could recount precisely the number of days since Chris fled Maybury—634 . <newline> <newline> This was how Jack ’ s mind worked . <newline> <newline> “ And to those of you wading in anguish and heartache , drown no more . For God shall flood the streets so you may learn to swim. ” <newline> <newline> The mass came to a close . The aisles of St. John ’ s became busy with the shuffling of Maybury ’ s churchgoers , which proved to be at least two-thirds of the small town . The 80-year-old Pastor , Vernon Pound , had successfully instilled a gut-wrenching fear of God ’ s word in the townspeople through his 50-plus years of service , yet seemingly , more work always lay ahead for the holy mediator . His aspirations reflected brightest in the eyes of Jack Dodson , who sat unaccompanied with his eye-lids parted as if they were gently , magnetically opposed to each other , fluttering and fluctuating between open and closed . He justified his refusal to exit as simply working overtime for the Lord , laboring in his workshop-away-from-home . At first the townsfolk found his behavior curious— clamoring remarks about his isolation used to seep in through the crevices of the church door , but had become sparser in the last few months as more entertaining affairs began to occupy the gossipers . Maybe it was for this reason he avoided the notice board that was the church steps . <newline> <newline> As he sat there , Jack ’ s thoughts were displayed in his mind only as images flitting across time . First , it was his belt-wielding father who entered scene and just as quickly transformed into his son restlessly sitting across the table in the studio where he first laid down the framework for his magnum opus . <newline> <newline> In an illusion fueled by ambiguity and confusion , the fragmented timepiece masterfully assembled and rose upwards where it boastfully presented itself , dissolving the scene from whence it came . The face of the watch emerged in a silhouette , shrouded in a haze of white that backlit the vision . Jack ’ s expression was muted , yet his flickering eye-lids would have undoubtedly intrigued a passer-by , if there were such a thing . He devoted his concentration to reveal the obscured exhibition , focusing with the same intensity that was forever rooted in his devotion to God . Before he was able to mentally outline the elegancies of the watch , the vision began to dissipate . His view became saturated in white as the light gleaming in from the background amplified , and frustrated with failure , he swung his eyes back , opening himself to the emptiness of the chapel . <newline> <newline> By now the red beam of light was bouncing off the last pew . <newline> <newline> 11:20 . <newline> <newline> Jack stood slowly , taking in one last meaningful glance at the portrait of Jesus hanging above the doorway , and clenching in his fist that fiery ball of light , he made his way to the porch . <newline> <newline> The church doors jerked open . The crowd outside was shocked but not surprised to see Jack emerge in a hurried fit , hands still clenched as if trying to keep a captured fly from fleeing his grasp . No one in the chatty cluster felt compelled to comment on his strange demeanor , enough had been said about it around dinner tables and at book club meetings . They stuck to what they did best . <newline> <newline> The main road through Maybury began at Hendry ’ s General Store and ended at St. John ’ s . Jack ’ s house was somewhere in between . Old Chuck Hendry had just seen a sizable shipment in by way of auto from Atlantic City sometime this morning . Saltwater Taffy , among other things—things he wasn ’ t quite able to make out from the conversation he overheard in the ninth pew . <newline> <newline> He remembered that it took Chris two years and six-and-a-half months for his teeth to grow in fully . He also remembered that it was only four months after that that Chris had discovered what those teeth could do to a piece of saltwater taffy . Jack saw Chris , frozen in time , smiling with a fat piece of vanilla taffy smashed between his teeth . He resented the churchgoers in the ninth pew for jogging his memory . <newline> <newline> Talk about adapting the main road to allow more auto traffic had been circulating around Maybury . Just last week Pastor Pound had squashed that hope . <newline> <newline> “ I have heard of this ‘ urban renewal. ’ Has God led us to arrogance ? Why are we to raze the buildings that He aided in constructing ? He will not have us sacrifice our homes and livelihood for the convenience of machines . If there is to be any renewal in Maybury , it is a renewal of faith. ” <newline> <newline> Naturally , Jack agreed . <newline> <newline> In the time that Jack spent pondering taffy and destruction , he had , as if by mere coincidence , found himself at the foot of wooden steps to his home . The workshop that faced the street was unchanged except for some letters stuffed under the door . Jack noted them in his mental to-do list and walked around to the back where he slept . <newline> <newline> He opened his palms to the brass knob on his back door . The fly had escaped . <newline>

1,"The Thespian <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> I had always been good at pretending . Star of every school play since age eight , great at accents and impressions , liar extraordinaire . My mind was a complex of dressing rooms which housed hundreds of characters from the bizarre to the banal , each with names , stories , and idiosyncrasies I could spin out within a moment 's notice . Had I been less focussed on financial stability and putting food on the table , I might have even become an actor . <newline> <newline> So , on the January 16th flight from Chicago O'Hare to Newark International Airport , it should come as no surprise that when I sat down next to the total stranger I 'd be boarding with for the next four hours , I ditched my personality faster than you could say , `` Your captain has turned on the seatbelt sign . '' <newline> <newline> When she looked over at me , with a face I 'd never seen and would never see again , she said with a smile , `` Hi , I 'm Jen . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hi , Jen , '' I replied , clipping the ends of my words with a faint Cockney bent . `` Benjamin . '' Peter , it was . But she did n't know . <newline> <newline> We shook hands . `` So what brings you to the Garden State ? '' she asked . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm going back to England from a business trip in Chicago , but I wanted to stop and see my father first . He 's ... unwell . '' <newline> <newline> I suppose it was that tantalising desire that tingles on your tongue and flits about your brain- the desire to be someone else , just for an hour or two , discard your identity like a worn coat in favour of some glittering new one . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , that 's awful ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Mm . '' I picked at the fingernails on my left hand- a quirk of Ben 's . He did it when he was worried . And with the state of his father- <newline> <newline> `` Why is he unwell , if I might ask ? '' <newline> <newline> -who would n't be ? <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I 'm sorry , '' she quickly amended herself , `` I really should n't pry . '' Midwestern timidity . The woman was a true Illinoisan , though likely not from Chicago . I had her pegged as a farm girl . <newline> <newline> `` No , it 's quite alright , '' I said . `` He has stage three liver cancer , and he 's had Alzheimer 's for some time . He 's definitely a character , though- there are quite a few stories about my dad , actually . I 'd be more than happy to tell some of them , if you 've got an hour or two to spare . '' <newline> <newline> `` No books , no television , no crosswords , no sleeping pills , no magazines without ads for bulletproof glow-in-the-dark watches . I ca n't think of a better way to spend my time . '' She smiled sweetly . <newline> <newline> So I told her about Ben 's father . About the unfortunate hunting accident that nearly took his leg in his thirties ( `` He really should 've waited till he was outside to actually shoot it ! '' ) About how he went to war , and the atrocities he saw there ( `` My dad looked at all the bodies- stacked like firewood , he said- and he told me he would have said a prayer for them if he 'd still believed god existed . '' ) About the most important lesson he 'd taught his son ( `` Take every opportunity you can find , no matter how insignificant it seems . '' ) About the time he accidentally swallowed a live earthworm ( `` He lived , of course , though I ca n't assure passing it was a pleasant experience . '' ) About his personality , his hopes , his dreams ( `` Larger than life , he was . Booming , boisterous , positively boiling over with it all . '' ) About why he moved to New Jersey ( `` To be closer to my sister Tara , who emigrated a while back . '' ) And finally , about the liver cancer and the Alzheimer 's that were eating away at his brain and body and decimating his memory ( `` Every time I talk to him on the phone- '' voice break for dramatic effect- `` he seems a little bit farther away . '' ) <newline> <newline> I did n't tell Jen , however , about my own father- Peter 's father . About his job as a railway mechanic . About the uneventful life he 'd led a few miles outside Chicago . About his total lack of stories . About the biggest lesson he 'd taught me : that safety , security , and stability far outweighed adventure , risks , and creativity . I did n't tell her that I 'd listened . I did n't tell her that , at every turn , I 'd traded opportunities and dreams for concrete realities . I did n't tell her that every day I worried that I was getting a little bit farther away . <newline> <newline> And so , every time Jen laughed at a retold joke or covered her mouth at a horrible story , a small part of Peter became a part of Benjamin . <newline> <newline> Benjamin , whose favourite colour was red , who had two older sisters , who picked at his fingernails when he was worried and looked down when he laughed , who liked his steak medium rare and his eggs poached , who liked to walk in the city streets just before dawn . <newline> <newline> This made it all the more difficult when the pilot 's voice drifted over the PA system , notifying us all of our impending arrival . The plane landed and Jen and I said our goodbyes . `` I hope your father gets better , Ben , I really hope he does . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thanks very much , love , '' I said . `` It was great meeting you . '' <newline> <newline> Back to baggage claim and out into the slicing winds of the winter night . And suddenly , stumbling into a taxi and hauling my luggage in after me , I was not Benjamin any more . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I wondered if anyone could tell . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> Please let me know if there 's any formatting issues- I 'm writing this from mobile so I hope it does n't look too wonky . <newline> <newline> Edit : HOLY CRAP thank you guys so much ! Seriously , the support and encouragement I 've received from you all is just too much . I started a subreddit tonight for everyone who 's shown interest in my work , it 's called r/sushideception and it 's a collection of everything I 've written , all in one place . It 's obviously a work in progress- I have no idea how to design a sub- but feel free to check it out : )

1,"Interlude : Growing up / Location : A World Between Worlds <newline> <newline> The sun was slowly setting in the horizon , displaying a wondrous kaleidoscope of orange , red and yellows on the canvas that is the ocean . A large pile of colourful amorphous Lego blocks rolled along the beach occasionally forming into a jeep , a crab , a robot and more . A dozen little [ Squirts ] ( http : //vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/bastion/images/2/24/Images-7.jpeg/revision/latest ? cb=20111022020546 ) giggled like children and chased the blob of Lego but were always just a bit too slow . <newline> <newline> A tall snow-white figure form walked leisurely across the beach watching the Lego blob and the Squirts play . This figure was skeletal and mechanical but moved with a gait that suggested much old age . He found a familiar spot in the sands near a palm tree . He sat down with a huff and the sand near him began gradually frosting over . <newline> <newline> `` Hey there old timer . '' <newline> <newline> The white mechanical figure turned his head and activated his [ mask ] ( http : //vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/bionicle/images/d/dc/Akaku3.jpg/revision/latest ? cb=20081217214330 ) . From behind the shrubbery near the palm tree emerged an old fox dressed in a dapper suit . <newline> <newline> `` It 's been a long time Mr Fox , '' the white being said . <newline> <newline> `` It 's been a long time Kopaka , '' said Mr Fox . <newline> <newline> `` I honestly thought he forgot about you , '' Kopaka said . <newline> <newline> `` Nonsense . I was the first character he fell in love with ! I am forever immortalised in his memories ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Luck you . He just stashed us in a box and in a broom closet with my brothers and sisters . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well . Kids grow old and toys are thrown away . My kids are growing up too . You should understand . You are far older and wiser . '' <newline> <newline> `` Biological beings , '' Kopaka shuddered . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't be so bitter . I was just the spark . You lot were the roaring flames that gave him light and even after you were snuffed out , your embers remained . Now he 's coaxing them back to life . Ever so slowly . He has n't given up on you . You and your brothers and sisters ' legacy lives on . '' <newline> <newline> The fox and the machine paused for a moment as a small white rabbit and a large reddish brown dog joined in the play with the Lego blob . In the far distance was a gorgeous silvery submarine with a drill point surfaced . Following it was Plesiosaurus trailing lazily with its head poking out of the water . <newline> <newline> `` You know , we should head inside . There are more of us there and we could reminisce the good old days together and welcome the newcomers . '' Mr Fox said . <newline> <newline> Kopaka grumbled and stood up . Both the mechanical being and the Fox walked deeper into the island . It progressively became darker and darker until both could only make out grey and white outlines of things moving surreptitiously in the undergrowth . Kopaka drew his sword . <newline> <newline> `` Goodness gracious Kopaka , what has gotten into you . They 're just Mistwraiths ! Put that away . He 's already had enough things going on in his brain . '' <newline> <newline> Kopaka grumbled again . Both continued to walk until they reached a very very large house . The house seemed to be a mish mash of different architectures from different time periods and different worlds . Some parts of the house were wooden , brick , concrete , floating , dirt and more . But somehow , it all managed to blend together in a haphazardly beautiful way . Both stepped into the house . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Mr Fox . Hey Kopaka . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh hello young lady . Why are n't you inside joining in on the fun ? '' Mr Fox said . <newline> <newline> `` You know me Mr Fox . I 'm not exactly a social butterfly . I want some quiet time to myself . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you decided to do that by working ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It feels like old times . A little bit . He probably would n't allow me to go back to that place even though it was my life . I do n't blame him though . It was kinda - it was horrible . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well . I hope you have a pleasant night Roberta . '' <newline> <newline> `` You too . '' Roberta said . <newline> <newline> Mr Fox and Kopaka walked into the main room . A soft murmur of a music was playing in the background , the smell of various types of Asian cuisine wafted through the air and despite the enormous amount of people , the room was n't stuffily warm . <newline> <newline> `` Alright old chap . While you were stuck in the broom closet , our old friend made some new friends ! Let me point them out to you ! That 's Aang , Taylor , Harry , really really *really* tall Harry , Vin , the Kid , the Chosen One , Rabbit , Sheason , Dipper , Maya , Spiderman , Geronimo , Kaladin , Amethyst , Vivenna , Nathan , Ms Martian - hey hey hey ! Where you going ? I have n't finished yet ! '' <newline> <newline> Kopaka made his way to the bar who was tended by a man wearing a spotless white apron . He was handing out drinks to a couple , a large beefy bearded man and a slim woman with her striking red hair in a ponytail . <newline> <newline> `` Thanks Mac . You 're the best . If you ever feel like seeing the start , hit me up and I 'll take you around the galaxy on the Hyperion '' the bearded man said . <newline> <newline> Mac grunted and turned to Kopaka . He looked over the white robot and began filling a glass with a dull metallic grey liquid . Kopaka accepted the drink with slight confusion as to how this man knew about protodermis but drank anyway . A small child in a pink shirt and a thin middle aged Indian man approached Kopaka . <newline> <newline> `` Hey ! You must be Kopaka ! We heard a lot of stories about you ! You 're like the first right ? You met him first ! I bet you have so many more stories to tell ! All the adventures you and your buddies and him went through ! Why do n't you join us ! '' the small child said . <newline> <newline> `` He 's growing up . He 's twenty now . He finally got to his senses and realised chasing after the childhood and teenage years was pointless . He 's not in denial anymore about his parent 's not getting older . He knows he ca n't be a kid any longer . He 's going to have jobs , responsibilities , people to take care of and other baggage . We 're just going to be relics of the past . Even you- what 's your name ? '' <newline> <newline> `` My name 's Steven ! We met recently ! He though I was annoying at first but we grew fond of each other ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I feel like I have to introduce myself too . My name is Pi Patel and we met a couple of years ago . '' the Indian man said . `` What you have said is all quite true . He is going to have to come to terms with his past , his loved one 's mortality and the passage of time . It is going to be difficult for him . That is why he needs us more than ever . '' <newline> <newline> `` We 're not even real . Or alive . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . True . But when he interacts with us and paints the scene in his head from the pages he reads , the screen he watched or the computer he interacts with , he gives us life and we give life back . We would n't be here in his head with him if it were n't for him , '' Pi said . <newline> <newline> `` As long as he remembers and I know he will , we 'll be with him every step of the way . We 'll always find a way . '' said Steven . <newline> <newline> `` Do you think some fictional characters can help him ? For crying out loud we 're just projections of his inner voice and imaginations ! '' Kopaka said . <newline> <newline> `` When he ca n't trust his own voice and his critics start torturing him , we 'll be there to help him and guide him . We 'll be there even when there is no one else around for him , '' Pi said . <newline> <newline> `` Just because you grow up does n't mean you have to let go of your childhood . '' Steven said . <newline> <newline> Kopaka looked at the two humans in front of him . He sighed and chugged down the rest of the protodermis . He stood up and started making his way to the crowd .

1,"The birth of `` The Gentleman '' <newline> <newline> Albert Mancer and his wife Jane lived the high life their noble blood thrust upon them . They were quite contempt to life out their life together in peace until one day , Jane fell ill . Her body was degenerating and the beast clerics in the land had no way to cure her , only slow down her inevitable demise . After calling an all the best healers in the world only to have them fail , Albert took matter into his own hands . He designed a way to extract the essence of a person ’ s soul and mind from the body and set them free from physical limitation . After testing this on rats however , he found that the smoke like essence of the creature couldn ’ t survive indefinably without a container to keep them together . So the next step was to develop the *insert name of new race here* . A mix of an undead and a construct , they wouldn ’ t feel pain or other physical limitation making them practically ageless . <newline> <newline> After much testing Albert was almost ready to complete the procedure when the news was dropped on him that Jane had stopped reacting to the healing spells keeping her stable . As he rushed to her bedside she looked right in the eye and said `` Alby ... I 'm scared ... '' Dread filled his heart . As he felt a lump in his thought he whispered `` Do n't worry me love , I have a plan '' he stood up , wiping his eyes and told the clerics to take her to his lab immediately . <newline> <newline> The machine was all set ; it had worked on animals that retained their memories on how to navigate mazes and what buttons to press to get food . He had wanted to test it out on a human *or whatever race he ends up being* before Jane was placed anywhere near the machine , however here he was , strapping his own wife , the love of his life into this essence wrenching contraption . On the other end of the device that now took up a whole room , he hooked up his wife ’ s temporary shell . At this early stage it was basically a rubber suit enchanted with ghost touch with a see through visor and an exoskeleton . <newline> <newline> As the contraption whirred into life the room crackled with energy as science and magic clashed in an un-natural battle to remove the body from the equation of a living being . As Jane ’ s body went limp a green light shone from the console Albert was watching . `` Stage 1 ; Essence removal complete '' said a robotic voice only just loud enough to be heard over the sparks and whirs of the machine . `` Do n't worry Jane , let it happen . '' Albert whispered under his breath . <newline> <newline> At this moment Jane ’ s soul and mind were separate from her body , and soon would be in a new body . Albert started to think of how he would design a proper body for Jane , with fine silk and gold to make her even a fraction as beautiful as her original body was . He quickly swiped these thought aside as he watched the console once more even though there was nothing he could do now but hope all his theories and models were correct . <newline> <newline> Just then a blast of arcane ripped into the room as a cloaked figure tore a hole in the fabric of space between where-ever they were and Albert ’ s lab . The figure reached out toward the machine as spectral arms flew through the tear and plunged into Albert ’ s contraption . `` What are you doing ! ? '' Albert roared at the intruder `` You 'll ruin everything ! '' The cloaked figure , without even looking at him waved his other hand towards Albert and more spectral hands charged towards him , grabbing him and pressing him against the wall . `` NO ! '' he shouted `` Leave it alone you ... you Savage ! '' That got the figures attention . `` You declare me a savage do you ? '' boomed the figures distorted voice `` You , who hath brutally tore away at the minds and souls of others , and for what ? To extend the life of this feeble creature ? '' The spectral arms that had dived into the machine slowly retracted showing a smoky shape . `` JANE ! '' Albert shouted `` ... help ... me ... '' emanated a voice from the smoke as the spectral arms wrapped themselves around her , encapsulating her . “ How dare you ! She deserves a full life ! Not shriveling away ! I could n't live with myself if I let her go like this ! '' Screamed Albert at the cloaked figure looming over him . `` Do n't worry , you wo n't have to , Savage . '' smirked the figure as it reached towards Albert . <newline> <newline> Shock is an interesting thing . It desensitizes you to pain , reason and many other things . The last Albert saw of Jane she and her old body were being dragged into the tear created by the Cloaked Figure . He blacked out as he felt a strange sensation in his left arm . Then both his legs , and finally in his gut . <newline> <newline> He barely came too when the fissure in space closed up . In front of him he saw his arm . He tried to move it , even though he could n't feel it . It did n't move . He tried to get up , but he could n't move his legs . He reached out with his right arm and pushed himself up . The body ’ s of the clerics that helped Jane stay stable while he worked on the machine were all laying there , dead . He noticed that his left arm was still lying on the ground ... The realization hit him like great hammer . His arm was on the ground as it was n't attached ! He couldn ’ t move his legs at they were broken . He sat up and saw as his abdomen had been stabbed into . He did n't have much time . He set a delayed start on the machine and dragged his broken form towards where his wife one sat . As he tried his best to strap himself in the machine whirred into life once more . Before he knew what had happened a white flash blinded him , and then visions of pipes and cogs flashed before him until finally , he could see the wall of his lab . As he moved , pipes disconnected from his new body and valves closed . It had worked , he gasped . He rushed as fast as this temporary carapace would let him to the start of the machine . There lay his old body , battered and broken . On the floor next to him was Jane ’ s old locket . It had a picture of them both together in it . He closed it and went to his bench to make a plan . To start to get Jane back .

1,"The Menessi and the Man ... <newline> <newline> DJ was the largest out of his family , he felt very proud of that . He was the youngest in the trio of siblings , matching age with his step sister . Teshyr was the oldest , but also the shortest , standing at 6'3 . Their sister Janette was the middle sister , in age , in skills , in height , but she was away from the family most of the time so she managed to avoid most fights . As DJ stood by his window , still in awe of the beautiful planet that he and his family had come to , he wondered what could possibly ruin this beautiful day . DJ had been through it all , from a planet exploding and having to singlehandedly evacuate everyone , to fighting another god near a black hole . That experience is something that had scared him the most . A light knock at the door and Teshyr spoke `` Hey DJ , mind coming with me to the deck ? Mom and Dad have something important for you . '' As Teshyr walked away , his wooden slippers clacked down the hallway , DJ thought of many things as to what his parents would want from him . <newline> <newline> `` There 's no way . No damned way that can happen . They 're squishy ! '' DJ said defiantly . `` And they reject us too ! Of all the worlds we visited so far , the majority of the inhabitants welcomed us with open arms , and we agreed to place them under our protection ! There has to be a way to convince them to trust us , and that 's why I chose you ! '' Tenebrae said . Dad was always scary when he got angry , and we had seen what a badass he becomes when he gets angry . Clearly there was no arguing with him on this subject , and I was fighting a losing battle already . `` Alright , ok dad , fine I 'll do it . '' I let out with a deep sigh . Mom was next to him as well , and this planet was her home planet . Figure that , her name is Mona , an abbreviation of Mother Nature . No wonder the Earth was so beautiful . <newline> <newline> `` Teshyr , get off my damned dresser and help me with this dumb problem . '' You would think that a family of gods would have no need for other clothing . On the contrary , we are a family of gods that act as a police force in the Pantheon of Gods . Quite a grand title , but it gets tiring , theres only so many times you can stop Zeus from brutalizing Thor , only so many times you can get between Odin and the Christian God . Fun fact , the man calls himself God , with a capital G. He 's quite a self absorbed prick . Back to what I was saying though , we get into fights , and either our armor get damaged or blown off , our clothes get ripped or burned or disintegrated . Takes a lot of time to design what we wear , so we have back ups for everything we wear . Teshyr and I were back in my room , and he may be older than me , but he tried to find ways to annoy me . <newline> <newline> `` Well what are you thinking ? How are you gon na do your entrance ? What are you gon na wear , what are you gon na say ? You ca n't exactly go down there and pick up someone and then come back , that 's kidnapping ! Unless its a kid , then its literal kidnapping ! '' He always held his arms out to his side and did a big cheesy smile like he was the god of jokes . That guy is cool , but my brother , he could use some work because that pun was painful . <newline> <newline> `` That 's why I asked you , you 're older , you know diplomacy better than I do , you 're the people person out of this family ! I ca n't believe dad is n't having you do this . '' I held my face in my hands , well , I had my mask in my hands , but I wish it was my face instead . <newline> <newline> `` He 's trying to teach you what I know as well , and you learn better if you crash and burn ! That 's why we count on you for certain fights ! '' I know what he 's doing , he 's trying to cheer me up and it is n't working . This thing looming over my head was dragging me down . <newline> <newline> `` Ok , then do you have any advice ? '' I think what I was wearing would be fine . I had on a white short sleeve button up shirt with a high collar , sliver gauntlets with sky blue highlights for the outlines and my hands , a white pair of cargo shorts with a black belt on , and silver greaves . I think when I go down , I 'll go without my mask on , Teshyr tells me because mankind is based off of the form of mother nature , that 's the form we take , so I guess I could relate to them . <newline> <newline> Not saying I should be surprised , but they shot me , and it had a lot of force behind it . Who shoots a god who is trying to come in peace with a tank round , moreover a round that 's a metal slug ? OK wait , let me rephrase that . Who shoots a god , REPEATEDLY , with slug tank rounds ? `` Alright ok fine , if you guys want to do it that way , then I have to escalate a bit . '' My mask always gave me comfort . Aside from hiding my facial expressions , it also let me get up close and personal without ruining my pretty face . With hands on the tank barrel , I just squeezed it closed on all of them . That would set them back , right ? `` Hey guys , do n't shoot anymore . I do n't think it would be a good idea . '' The soldiers kept their weapons trained on me though , very tenacious . One of them said something , I could n't decipher it until I smacked my headphones a bit . They 're a universal translator . `` I 'm sorry , would you say that again please ? My translator was broken . '' `` I said put your hands up , and do n't move a muscle ! '' The brown man was very angry , I can tell he did n't want to be here , and my arrival was not helping his day . Why was he wearing four silver stars on his helmet ? <newline> <newline> Oh sure , surrender , go with them in peace , that was the plan was n't it ? They kept trying to cut me and my clothes , and no matter what I said , they just kept trying . `` Guys this is n't going to work . I tanked a slug shell from a tank , your blades ca n't cut me or my stuff . '' A couple minutes went by and they kept bringing in larger and larger tools , until the tools had gotten comically large . `` Hey do you guys have a leader or something , like a president or a prime minister ? Maybe a king or a lord of the land ? '' Finally , one of the operators spoke up , `` Yeah we have a president , his name is Barack Obama , he 's also our Commander in Chief since you decided to come down from that fortress up there . '' There goes my first impression . `` Oh ok , well uh , where does he live or work exactly ? I tried coming in peace with you guys , but my peace was met with gun fire . '' `` It 's called the White House , its literally all white outside , and I think some people live in it . Have n't been in there myself , but once we cut you open , I know I 'll get to go . '' Oh , you 'll get to go buddy , but not for succeeding . `` Yeah it 's been a fun little chat , but I have to go now . '' Their leather straps were like wet toilet paper , and I took off like a rocket straight through their ceilings . My processor in my mask told me exactly where it was . Lets hope my second impression is better than the first . <newline> <newline> Back at the facility ... <newline> <newline> The man in the blue scrubs walked up to the man in green , both staring at the holes DJ left . The man in blue looked down to see the man in green was still dumbfounded . `` Jenkins you idiot ! '' A loud slap resounded through the room . <newline> <newline> This was a fun little story I thought of on the spot , a different spin on an original story I have . I feel like I 've done better with this one than what I currently have written on my original .

1,"I leaned back in the chair , feeling my muscles go limp as shock settled in . The screen in front of me played the footage over and over again , the only video of its kind . A transmission from a star far , far away that had mystified the greatest scholars in the galaxy . <newline> <newline> Krang knocked on the door . `` Hello ? Amanda ? '' Normally , I 'd have invited him in , but I was n't sure he wanted to see this . `` I 'm coming in now . '' He stepped inside the room , respectful and wary of my presence . Everyone was wary of us . <newline> <newline> One hundred Earthyears ago , humanity took its first interstellar steps . We launched a ship to Alpha Centauri , a journey that took two years with our primitive warp drives . The explorers aboard that ship were surprised to find a large fleet of battleships awaiting them . They were even more surprised when faces and forms just like ours greeted them using our communication protocols . Turned out life throughout the galaxy had evolved in the same way : two legs , two arms , five fingers , opposable thumbs . We were n't all Human - some called themselves Da'gassi , or Philaean - but we had identical biologies . Some saw it as proof of the existence of God , others interpreted it as the universe 's idea of a practical joke . <newline> <newline> These newfound neighbors revered us as gods . We had come from a sector of space that was thought to be inhabited by the Tharseeli , a vicious and brutal race . They were fiercely tribal , and war seemed like a sport to them . Death on a massive scale was tolerated and expected in their society , and the galactic community was starting to worry . What if they stepped off their planet ? What if they came here ? Then one day , they vanished . Radio activity from their planet all but ceased , and then we showed up . The other civilizations figured that those events were closely connected , and bestowed upon us the honor of eliminating a foe we never knew existed . We denied it , and promised to find out what happened to the Tharseeli . Ostensibly , it was to ensure that they would never threaten the galaxy , but humans have always been curious . We needed to know what really happened . <newline> <newline> Further exploration of stars close to Sol revealed the remnants of another civilization , just on the brink of achieving interstellar travel . Our archaeologists deduced that their society had self-destructed . The planet was war-torn and irradiated , with vast areas cleansed and sterile for the rest of eternity . We guessed that this was the grave of the Tharseeli , whose vicious tendencies had been their undoing . We announced our success , and the galaxy 's respect for us grew . Within a few Earthyears , the other races were speaking our languages and imitating us more closely . It was clear that we were seen as special , a unique race that many could imitate , but only we were worthy to rule the stars . And so we took up our mantle , and our empire grew . <newline> <newline> `` Amanda ? Are you alright ? '' Krang 's voice was tender , but not condescending . He looked at the screen . `` Oh , Amanda . You should n't watch those Tharseeli transmissions alone . You know how disturbing they are . '' Now he was condescending . <newline> <newline> I turned to him . He recoiled slightly as he saw the shock on my face , then collected himself and put on his best bedside smile . `` Come on . You need a break . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , I ... this is ... '' The enormity of my discovery was impossible to convey . How could I explain this ? `` This ... these are n't Tharseeli transmissions . '' <newline> <newline> Krang laid his hand on my shoulder . `` Yes they are . That 's why you should take a break . '' <newline> <newline> `` Krang , you do n't understand . Look ! '' I tapped the screen , scrolling the video to a clip of a Tharseeli in a vehicle , riding down a lane lined with people . I felt Krang 's grip tighten as I pointed at the screen . `` You see ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Amanda ... I do n't think I want to watch this clip . '' The Tharseeli waved to the crowd . The sound was too corrupted to recover from the centuries-old footage , but the reaction was visible through the distortions . The crowd of Tharseeli waved vigorously , their fanaticism for their leader evident . `` You know what happens . Come on , stop the video . Let 's go . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ca n't you see it ? Look ! '' I was raising my voice . I was starting to cry . `` Look at the video , Krang ! What do you see ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I see Tharseeli . I would like to see a cup of Da'gassi tea . '' <newline> <newline> `` No ! Look ! Look at their faces , their hands ! '' The Tharseeli leader kept waving as his vehicle came closer to the camera . The operator zoomed in to catch the vehicle passing by . <newline> <newline> `` ... Amanda . I understand now . '' <newline> <newline> `` You do ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . The Tharseeli are just like us . We all have deep instincts that we have chosen to suppress . That is why we did not destroy ourselves as they did . '' The Tharseeli leader waved again . <newline> <newline> `` No ! Dammit , Krang , look at the footage ! '' I still could n't say it . It did n't register . <newline> <newline> `` Amanda ... '' The Tharseeli 's vehicle turned slightly , its side facing the camera . I lost it . <newline> <newline> `` Krang , WE are the Tharseeli ! '' The Tharseeli 's head snapped back , blood spattering the other seats in the car . <newline> <newline> `` ... What ? '' The car accelerated . <newline> <newline> `` This footage is from *Earth* , Krang . These are humans ! '' The President 's motorcade sped offscreen as his wife held his corpse . <newline> <newline> `` I ... do n't understand . '' <newline> <newline> `` We are not gods ! We did n't save you from anything ! The civilization that we found committed suicide because they saw *us* ! They saw what we were and knew we would destroy them if we found them ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey , you- '' <newline> <newline> `` We built an empire on lies , Krang ! We- '' <newline> <newline> `` Amanda ! Get a hold of yourself ! '' Krang put my face in his hands , gently turning my head to look at him . `` I see now . I understand . '' I felt myself calm down , and pulled away . Krang leaned on a nearby table , lost in thought . We sat in silence for several minutes , the shock wearing off for both of us now . <newline> <newline> `` We ca n't tell anyone . '' <newline> <newline> I turned to Krang . `` What ? '' <newline> <newline> `` This does n't leave this room . '' His friendly , caring demeanor was gone . Krang was suddenly resolute , more determined than I had ever seen him . I felt a chill run down my spine as an old Earth saying ran through my head . *Demons run when a good man goes to war . * <newline> <newline> `` We ca n't keep this a secret , Krang . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , we have to . This could upset everything . I mean interstellar warfare . '' He got up and walked over to a terminal . `` Humanity must remain unchallenged . If word got out that the Tharseeli were running our governments , well ... '' He typed a few passwords and brought up a dialog . I got up . <newline> <newline> `` Krang , what are you doing ? '' I read the window . <newline> <newline> < ARCHIVE PURGE INITIATED . ENTER CREDENTIALS. > <newline> <newline> `` Stop ! '' I moved towards him . <newline> <newline> `` Why ? '' I faltered and stopped . `` You do n't understand what 's at stake . Look at what happened when a single world saw your race for what it was , Amanda . They cleansed their world and sterilized it so no life could ever see the horror of the Tharseeli . '' Krang turned to me . `` Civilizations would rather kill themselves that risk you butchering them . Imagine what would happen if an entire galaxy found out that they had placed their trust in monsters like that . '' <newline> <newline> He held my gaze as his words sunk in . Finally , I turned away . `` Fine . '' <newline> <newline> Krang turned back to the console and entered a code . <newline> <newline> < PURGE COMPLETE . THARSEELI RECORDING AND ROOM AUDIO LOGS DELETED. > <newline> <newline> `` Now come on . I owe you a cup of tea . '' <newline> <newline> `` ... Okay . '' <newline> <newline> I followed him out of the archive room , the burden of my forbidden knowledge mingling with the accomplishment of averting interstellar war . I felt as though my insides would pull themselves apart as one thought raced through my mind . <newline> <newline> *We are not gods . * <newline> <newline> -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> With apologies to /r/HFY . Thanks for reading !

1,"Changing States <newline> <newline> The house was dimly lit , with beer cans littering the countertop and large table in the room . A laser light in the middle of the room illuminated indiscriminate skimpily clad women and jean dressed men as it spun on its axis . <newline> Suddenly , from across the room , John noticed a beautiful woman , with blonde hair in a quarter part flowing over her bare shoulders and sandals covering her painted toenails above a pair of form fitting jeans that hugged her figure nicely . Staring longingly into John ’ s eyes , John was stunned and looked away . But when he looked back , she was just mere feet away and approaching him with hip swaying confidence . <newline> <newline> The alarm went off at 5:30 AM , as it does every day John works . Groggily , he reached for the snooze button , knowing full well that he didn ’ t have time to snooze for those golden 10 extra minutes . Dejectedly , John rose and head to the bathroom . It was time for the morning routine : shower , shave , put in contacts , brush teeth , and take his pills . The pills were important , if he didn ’ t take them , he felt uncomfortable the whole day . <newline> To John , it seemed gray outside today . In his uniform , thick blue pants with multiple pockets on each side and a blue button down shirt with a PGH EMT patch on the side , John drove to the hospital in the beat up Hyundai Sonda he ’ s owned for years now . It ’ s dents never bothered him , but today was different . He longed for a new car . One with working A/C , one that didn ’ t smell like the McDonalds he got most days on his way home . <newline> <newline> It never took long to get to work , there was never any traffic at this time . Despite this , John zipped down the highway . His father always emphasized driving slow , his father a traffic court judge , but he hasn ’ t lived with them for years . <newline> <newline> John saw Mike standing , leaning against their ambulance smoking a cigarette . His hair was unkempt as usual and his glasses were round , framing an otherwise pointed face . <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t know how you smoke so early , Mike ” John said , with a slight smile on his face . <newline> <newline> “ I just inhale my friend , ” Mike replied , a smirk creeping across his right cheek . He dropped the cigarette at his feet , ashes splashing where it bounced on the ground , and simultaneously stomped on the butt . “ Ready for breakfast ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You know it , ” John said . Unnoticed by Mike , his original enthusiasm already left his voice . <newline> <newline> The two EMT ’ s drove through the tight Pittsburgh streets to Al ’ s deli . They walked in , triggering a bell that was too loud and high pitched to be heard at such an hour . A bald , stocky man in a plain black tee shirt a little too small for his figure was standing behind the counter on his phone and looked up at the two men with tired eyes . <newline> <newline> “ Hello , my friends . The usual today ? ” Al said . <newline> <newline> “ I think I ’ ll go with the Yinzer today . Switch things up a little , ” said Mike . <newline> <newline> “ Same as always for me , ” said John . <newline> <newline> The EMT ’ s walked to the opposite side of the store to the booths and a mirror covered the entire wall . On the way , John looked at the two of them , wondering to himself how many times they ’ ve done this exact same thing . He quickly pushed the thought to the back of his mind , he was on the clock . <newline> <newline> “ I didn ’ t tell you what happened to me last weekend , ” Mike said after they sat down on opposite sides of the booth . It was story time , Mikes favorite time of the day . “ So I was at McFaddens , you know that new bar that ’ s big with singles , and I saw , no lie , an angel . She was beautiful , lem me tell you. ” <newline> <newline> John looked at Mike with glassy eyes , half listening to Mikes latest conquest , something he seems to do every weekend , politely nodding and smiling when something funny happened . Mike was one his only good friends , but these crazy stories never seemed to happen when they went out together . He was still happy to hear the tall tale ; silence is always uncomfortable . <newline> <newline> “ Foods ready ” Al said , interrupting an engrossed Mike . <newline> <newline> “ So once we were back at my place , I get a call from Jake , who said the chick ’ s friend started throwing up everywhere. ” , Mike said , followed by laugh one can only have when such events happen to close friends . “ Apparently it wasn ’ t from alcohol , just from eating too much dairy in her melt. ” After paying for the food , the two walked in silence to the truck . <newline> <newline> They drove to their usual spot , right on the corner of 5th and Kirkpatrick . Mike , breaking the silence , asked John , “ So , do anything fun this weekend ? ” . <newline> <newline> “ No , just was catching up on some sleep . Had work five days in a row , was really tired. ” John had only worked three days last week . <newline> <newline> “ Understandable , this job certainly gets to you. ” <newline> <newline> After John finished eating , he laid his seat back and closed his eyes , for what only seemed to be a minute before the radio began shouting , “ Medic 6 , Medic 6 . 32nd and Green Street , apartment number 7 . 72-year-old male Mark Munchack . Chest pain , requesting transport to the hospital. ” John sighed and pulled his seat up , preparing himself for the first call of the day . It didn ’ t seem serious , but mental preparation is always necessary . You never know , and he had a responsibility to always be ready . <newline> <newline> The two men drove the five minutes required and arrived at the apartment complex . The complex was an old , brick building , common for Pittsburgh , three stories high and full of soot . It clearly hasn ’ t been power-washed since pre-coal days . Mike buzzed the bell for apartment 7 and , fifteen seconds later , heard the intercom whine in annoyance and opened the door . They then ascended a short number of steps and reached apartment 7 , finding it open . <newline> <newline> “ Finally you ’ re here , what the hell took so long , ” A man said when he saw the two in the doorway . He was sitting in an old dark green love-seat facing the door on an angle , feet resting on a dusty rug . Mr. Munchack was had a half-halo of white hair around the back of his head . It was almost like he had one foot was in the grave . He was wearing white slacks and a plaid polo tee shirt from well before John ’ s time . The geriatric was breathing normal , using no accessory pleural muscles in his chest they tell you to look for . <newline> <newline> “ Sorry Mr. Munchack , we came as fast as we could , ” said John as he walked in , as appeasing as he could muster without feeling meek . ‘ I needed to project more confidence to strangers , ’ he thought . He immediately noticed many old black and white photos on the walled up fireplace mantle across from Mr. Munchack of a young man with a full head of dark hair smiling with a young , pleasant woman , usually in a fancy dress of some sort , in iconic places across America , from the Grand Canyon to San Francisco to New York City . Mike spoke to the man and brought John back to the world of color . <newline> <newline> “ What seems to be the problem today , sir ? ” said Mike , bag over his shoulder of various equipment and medicines . <newline> <newline> With a glare , he said , “ I already told the operator , shouldn ’ t you know ? I was walking up the steps , as I always do , and once I got to the top my chest started to hurt and I couldn ’ t catch my damn breath. ” <newline> <newline> Taking a step forward , John said , “ Don ’ t worry , we ’ re here to take care of you . My name is John and this Mike . We would like to listen to your heard and get a blood pressure reading , is that ok ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Fine , just make this damn pain stop. ” <newline> <newline> John reached into his bag and grabbed the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff . He would have liked an EKG , but much to his chagrin he wasn ’ t a paramedic . Maybe one day he will go back to school like he always would tell grandma when he saw her on the holidays . <newline> <newline> “ So , sir , do you take any medications ? ” Mike asked while John went through the tests . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , a blood thinner , a blood pressure medication , it ’ s been high for a long time . And an aspirin every morning. , ” He replied , a little calmer and more at ease . “ My wife had the same thing , she had really high blood pressure . It was never in control , but mine isn ’ t as bad . I have been getting tired more recently , but I still wake up with the sunrise . Have been all my life , ever since the farm days as a child . It was my job to get the milk , you know , and those cows didn ’ t milk themselves . But that all changed when I moved to the city with Phyllis… ” <newline> <newline> While the man was rambling , John performed his battery of tests . There seemed to be nothing acutely wrong . His lungs sounded clear , his heart sounded normal , his pulse was fine , and there seemed to be no problems with respiratory rate . Guilt ran deafeningly through John . It was clear he only wanted someone to talk to . <newline> <newline> “ …And that was how my sister broke her leg back in grade school . Lets see , what other medical history is there in my family. ” <newline> <newline> Before he could resume speaking , John said , “ Sorry to interrupt , but it sounds like your lungs are clear and pulse is good . Do you still have pain in your chest ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes , it ’ s still there , and I want to be taken to the hospital. ” <newline> <newline> “ Alright , you said you don ’ t take any nitroglycerin , correct ? ” <newline> <newline> “ No , but I ’ ve taken it before . A few weeks ago , I think , back when I was strolling through the park and had to sit down . I- “ <newline> <newline> “ Alright well we have some and it could definitely make you feel better. ” John said . ‘ Callous , inconsiderate , unworthy… ’ bored into his mind . “ Would you like some ? ” <newline> <newline> After administering the nitroglycerin under his tongue , the two helped him into a mobile chair and carried the man to the ambulance , where the myriad of questions were asked to Mr. Munchack by John as they made the quick trip to the hospital in no rush . <newline> <newline> “ It was great to meet you , and I hope you feel better , ” said John after passing off the now kind old man to the hospital staff , echoed by Mike ’ s own sentiment . The two EMT ’ s walked out of the hospital and back into their truck . <newline> “ Another wasted call . There are people out there in real pain and he is just wasting our time with his calls . Did you see how many times he ’ s been to the hospital ? Man , what a waste of taxpayer money. ” <newline> <newline> John solemnly nodded , staring out the window . “ So , about that new bar . When are you going to show it to me ? ” <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"`` The Short Story '' <newline> ( I wrote this for my english class a couple months ago . ) <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The clock was ticking . It was 11 o ’ clock , post meridiem . I was stressed beyond comparison . I had spent the whole day messing around with my friends , causing me to forget about the 1000 word short story that was due the next day . I sat in my room , contemplating how I was going to pull this one off . I opened my computer and created a document . “ Short story draft ” were the first words I wrote in bold at the top of the page , alongside my name , Jacob . <newline> <newline> I tried to pull inspiration out of thin air . I tried to look through my pocketbook that I used for my English class , but it was empty . I put it in my pocket to save it for later . My eyes were already starting to feel heavy . The need for sleep that I required to function every day was starting to become a problem . I started slapping and pinching myself to make sure that I didn ’ t doze off . My inspiration levels were low . I stared at my screen endlessly , with no words to put on the paper . I closed my eyes . I woke up and looked at the digital clock on my laptop . 11:30 PM . I need to work , I thought to myself . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the room started shaking . I scrambled for cover . I ran to my door to find shelter in my home , but when I touched the handle , it broke off . I got under my desk table and put my hands over my head , which was the only thing I remembered to do in the case of an earthquake . <newline> <newline> After about 20 seconds , the shaking stopped . I got out from under my table and went towards the window to see what happened . When I opened the blinds , I found myself staring at a plain white wall instead of the neighborhood I was familiar with . I thought to myself that it must be a dream , like the Wizard of Oz , where the protagonist ’ s house gets transported to an unfamiliar land . <newline> <newline> I felt a weight accumulate in my pocket . I reached in to figure out why , and I found a notepad and a ballpoint pen . I opened the notepad to the first page , and found the words : “ Take inspiration. ” Strange , I thought to myself . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , my door burst open . A man in a purple suit stood at the door , holding what seemed to be a vacation pamphlet . I was unable to make out his face . “ Welcome , welcome , welcome , ” he said in a familiar voice . “ You are inside of your own brain . I brought you here because you needed help with something . Technically you aren ’ t allowed to leave until you figure out a plan for what you need to do. ” <newline> <newline> “ Who are you ? ” I asked quickly . <newline> <newline> “ You can call me your conscience . I am here to guide you through this land and show you what you need to know. ” He stepped forwards into my room . I observed his face - it was completely identical to my own . “ Do not fear . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get along just fine. ” <newline> <newline> Sure , I thought to myself . We get along just fine , especially when I ’ m procrastinating and you ’ re nagging at me not to . <newline> <newline> “ I heard that , ” he said amusingly . “ Come along now . If you don ’ t , you won ’ t get what you need , ” he said , resembling the voice that resonated in my head when I was doing something questionable . <newline> <newline> I followed him outside of my door . My house was no longer with me , only my room followed into my dreams . We found ourselves in a hallway , no bigger than six feet tall and four feet across , white on all sides . The walls and floor were perfectly symmetrical and untarnished , almost as if it was created by a computer . About every five feet there was a small rectangular door with a word over it . <newline> <newline> My conscience told me the purpose of this . “ This hallway is your thought station . All of your self created thoughts reside inside of these doors , including your ideas , inquiries , imaginations , memories , you name it. ” We walked until we reached a door labeled “ Short Story Conventions. ” Those words seemed familiar to me , but I couldn ’ t quite remember what they meant . <newline> <newline> I opened the door and walked in . I found myself in the English classroom , except instead of many desks lined up , there was only one desk in the center of the room . “ I advise you to sit in that desk , ” my conscience said . I decided to follow my conscience and do as he said . <newline> <newline> Immediately after I sat my bottom into the chair , my English teacher appeared right in front of me . “ EXPOSITION , ” she said in her loud teaching voice . “ THE INTRODUCTION TO A STORY . CHARACTERS , SETTING , CONFLICT , AND POINT OF VIEW ARE GIVEN HERE. ” <newline> <newline> As she said this , a notebook flew out of my pocket and into my hands . I wrote down what she said . She went through the conventions of plot , such as the rising action , climax , falling action , and resolution . As the lesson slowly came to a close , the room started collapsing on itself . Not in the sense that it was breaking apart , but that the room was caving in on itself , as if someone was squeezing a small bag from the outside . <newline> <newline> I ran out as fast as I could . I found myself in the hallway again . I found my conscience on the left . “ So , how did it go ? ” He asked . <newline> <newline> “ Well , I learned about the structure of a short story , ” I said . “ We went through everything , such as exposition , risi- ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , yeah . I heard it , just making sure you remembered , ” my conscience interrupted . He led me down the hallway to another door that was labeled “ creating voice. ” Inside I found the same exact room . I sat down in the chair , and my teacher appeared once again , using her loud teaching voice . This time , instead of learning about stories , she taught me how to create voice in the short story . How to represent the character that I was writing through diction , syntax , and imagery . I wrote all of these things down in my little notebook . After we finished going through creating imagery using different techniques , the room started collapsing again . I ran out to find my conscience . <newline> <newline> He was already standing at the door . “ Follow me . This will be a long walk , the next thing I ’ m taking you to is at the very end of the hallway. ” <newline> <newline> We started walking for what seemed like hours . Every once in awhile we ’ d run into some strange object , such as a hippopotamus with a birthday hat on roller skates or a talking chair . My conscience explained that it was just memories being leaked from the “ bored ” part of my brain , which happened occasionally . <newline> <newline> Finally , we reached a door . Instead of being like all of the other normal white doors with text over it , it had letters written in a cursive font on the door - “ Inspiration. ” <newline> “ I can not follow you into this door , ” my conscience said . “ Inside you might find terrors , happiness , or really anything . This is the room of imagination and inspiration , where anything that you think of can happen . Anything that your brain can comprehend is possible inside of these doors . Be careful. ” <newline> <newline> “ Thanks , ” I told my conscience . <newline> <newline> “ Don ’ t mention it. ” <newline> <newline> I walked into the room . I found myself in a void with no floor . I was simply there . Everything around me was black , and there were no objects in sight . <newline> I started imagining things . Literally . The first thing I thought up was the hippopotamus we ran into in the hallway . Without delay , a hippopotamus with a birthday hat stood in front of me . I started to play with this newfound ability , allowing the hippopotamus to dance to music I made up in my mind . <newline> After a few minutes of toying with my imagination , I got to work . I thought to myself , what will make my short story interesting ? I started thinking up original scenarios , and of course I was immediately put into these scenarios after I thought them up . <newline> <newline> The first thing that came from my imagination was a scene from World War II . I hovered over the land as if I had the ability to see everything . I followed a commando officer as he ran through the battlefield , defeating enemy Germans and being the deciding factor in a very important battle in the war . This might be a good idea , I thought . <newline> <newline> There were issues . There was no way to progress a story of that kind , and all of the characters I could think of were very thin and had no arc . I immediately moved on to the next idea . <newline> <newline> As my brain formulated my thoughts into sequences , I observed sparks of light appearing , dissolving , and contorting into each other to form items . A green blob of light arranged itself into a large plane of grass , while a colossal item of grey made itself into a castle . I found myself in a medieval story . A prince and a dragon appeared . <newline> <newline> “ YOU ’ LL NEVER DEFEAT ME , ” The dragon told the prince in a deep , rasping voice . The dragon spat fire at the prince , who skillfully dodged it . <newline> <newline> “ I am the rightful heir to the throne ! It is my destiny to defeat you ! ” The prince retorted as he shot an arrow at the dragon , which hit it directly in the eye . <newline> <newline> Super cliche , I thought . Maybe not this one . <newline> <newline> After that idea I couldn ’ t think of anything . Every little idea I had ended up being a random thought that couldn ’ t be turned into a real short story . Little wisps of light would contort and form around me but only to dissolve into dust seconds later . <newline> <newline> “ Think of something , ” I told myself . “ Think of something special. ” <newline> <newline> “ Something , ” I said . I thought to the last memory I remembered . Suddenly , I saw a floating surface that resembled the floor in my room . The surface started generating items , such as my desk , my clock , and my bed . Soon enough , I saw myself on the surface , pinching myself trying to stay awake whilst trying to pull inspiration from thin air . <newline> <newline> “ Well there ’ s something , ” I said to myself . At that point it was set . My idea was the lack of an idea . <newline> <newline> The area around me started collapsing . The void was caving in on itself . I couldn ’ t see it , but it felt like I was in a garbage compactor that was squeezing trash to maximize space . The world started getting tighter and tighter and I was unable to breathe and then I lost vision ... . <newline> <newline> I woke up on top of my computer . I looked over at my clock . 12:30 AM . I opened my short story ’ s document and erased the “ Short story draft ” at the top . I reached into my pocket , and found a notebook which had notes on how to write narratives . <newline> <newline> At the top of the page , I wrote in bold , underlined text : “ The Short Story . ”

1,"Chapter 1 : <newline> He scurries past the rats on his way home after a successful day of work . Down the dirty alleys , through musty tunnels underneath bigger homes made of clay and stone , and past the familiar faces he 's seen on the corners for the past 16 years . As the sun sets the breeze of the warm air feels good spiraling around his body as he dashes down the pock-marked dirt road . He opens his tunic to let the breeze glide over his dark green scales , and opens his hands to let the wind brush through his claws . The people of the neighborhood are going inside for their last meals of the day . <newline> <newline> The human man clothed with rags of all different exotic colors who lives on his corner is tending to the flowers in a small pot on his window sill . Further down the road is his own home situated between two shacks of lesser size . It is broken down , cold , dark , and quiet . The neighbor to the right is a very old Elvish woman with long pointed ears and a similarly long pointed nose with fantastic stories of her adventures overseas . She personally knows hundreds of years of history that she has experienced , from the wars in Licportia and Xeodong , to having attended three meetings at the Council of Elders in Nealean . Having no family , and after having outlived all her friends , she moved to this city to live out the remainder of her exciting lifestyle in peace . As a child he would listen to her stories as often as he could . <newline> <newline> To the left is a shack that used to be inhabited by a small struggling family of Dwarves who hailed from the north . They weren ’ t used to the hot weather beating down on their pale skin and were constantly changing their clothes due to their profuse sweating . They once considered cutting their hair in order to make themselves cooler , but the Elvish woman helped them adapt by lending tunics of her own and introducing her to her own Dwarven friends in the area . They worked hard and did their best to chug along in the rough world of the Rausdibian deserts . The father and the only son were hired to protect a merchant caravan headed through the desert to the neighboring country of Irstentorf . They were attacked . There were no survivors . The mother was a wreck after having lost her only two family members and returned to her homeland in Krahunsh . The shack has been rotting ever since . <newline> The Lizian man approaches his own home lying in the middle . The doorway is made of a single rotted plank of wood surrounded by brown clay like the rest of the shanties surrounding it . He pushes into the entryway with a small creak as the door ’ s rusty hinges shout in protest . A single dim candle flickers , allowing just enough light to shine on the face of the figure lying in the single bed . He rushes to the man , and kneels down beside him . <newline> He rubs his hand across the man 's forehead , `` Father , how are you feeling today ? '' <newline> <newline> The older man grunts and grits his fangs , `` Oh , hello there , '' his attempt to sit up was interrupted by a violent coughing fit . <newline> <newline> `` Please , '' the young man says , slapping his father 's back lightly . `` You do n't have to get up for me . '' <newline> His coughing ceases as he pulls himself to sit up in his bed . `` You worry too much . The doctor even said I need a little exercise now and again . Heheh- '' he resumes coughing into his scaly green hand . He spits a glob of saliva at a bucket next to his bed . It 's nearly half full . <newline> <newline> `` Dad , that was years ago . Your legs hardly work anymore . Just please , lay back down and rest , I got some dinner for us . '' He pushes the man back to his back , gingerly laying him down on the ratty bed of straw and cloth . He then pulls two apples out of his pouch , and begins slicing one up . <newline> <newline> `` Apples ? '' The man in the bed is surprised . `` I have n't had those in years ! '' He claps his hands together in glee while looking through the cieling filled with holes and tears . <newline> <newline> `` There was a shipment at port today , lots of exotic fruits and vegetables . I 'll try to get some more from the market tomorrow . '' He cuts a bit too deep through an apple and slices his finger . He holds back his wince and ignores it for now , making a mental note to clean his blade later . `` Here , eat up . '' He offers a sixth of the apple , holding it to the old man 's mouth . The man stretches his neck gingerly , and bites , taking half of the slice into his mouth . A bit of juice slips down his lower lip , but his forked tongue slips through his yellow teeth to grab it . The rest of the slice is pushed into his mouth by the young man 's dark green claw . The young man bites into the other apple , while still holding out slices for his father . He grabs the knife from his lap with the tip of his dark green tail , and tosses it to the corner of the room near his larger leather sack . After three slices the old man lays his head back . <newline> `` That 's enough for now . I can finish tomorrow . '' He coughs lightly , and rolls onto his side , facing his son . He grabs the boy 's hand and squeezes it as tightly as he can . The candlelight is low , flickering on the man 's face . His orange eyes are sunken into his pale and bony face . His weak scales flake off of his tender skin and onto the pillow . It hurts him to even smile , but he still beams a toothy grin at his child . `` I 'm proud of you son . Every day I am proud of you . I love you , Neri . '' He closes his eyes and promptly falls asleep . The young man bows his head , and lays down in the corner of the room next to his things . His meager `` bedding '' consisting of his bag of personal objects and a thin cloth is all he has for the night . He has no time to sleep , because he has a job to do in a few hours , so he closes his eyes and counts the seconds he can spend with his father . <newline> <newline> Chapter 2 : <newline> <newline> The night is cold on his dark screen scales . He shivers thanks to his cold blood that normally keeps him comfortable during the day . The uniform he wears can not block the cold winds of a desert night . The breeze flutters past the flags and the masts of the gigantic ships in front of him , and through the slats of the wooden crate he and his partner are hiding within . Money had been getting low for the guild , but tonight 's job should get them some nice bonuses . Neri looks forward to a newer and better fitting pair of pants , without a makeshift hole cut in the ass for his tail . Neri pulls out his dagger , and pokes it to the tiny scab on his finger . The Murid man next to him spies intently at the large ship in front of them , watching for any movement . His long fur-covered face smiles as the breeze passes across him . He looks down his pink-tipped nose to spy on the large ship in front of him . The symbol of a merchant fleet is painted onto its flag at the top . Neri scowls at the night sky , knowing it ’ s either succeed the mission or go hungry for who knows how long . <newline> <newline> `` Neri , Neri , can you see that ? '' His skinny arm wrapped in black rags points to the crows nest . Neri squints his eyes . <newline> `` What am I looking for Herx ? '' He sees the man in the crows nest sitting there , rocking back and forth on a stool most likely . <newline> <newline> Herx hisses at him through large pointed front teeth , `` He 's sleeeeeeping ! '' He lowers his skinny arm and turns excitedly to his partner , pumping his fists up and down in front of himself . <newline> `` I 'll go tell the point-man. ” He crawls out of the back of the box , pushing some barrels out of the way that were hiding the opening , `` You keep your eye on him . '' He turns back and points at the crate , growling , `` and for the love of all the gods if you move too early again I wo n't bring you back in one piece . '' Neri slinks up the road , keeping as close to the gutter as possible . Two lazy guards are shouting at each other down the road about a woman they both believed to be their own girlfriend . They shout over one another and pull out their swords which are slightly rusted by the salty sea air , and begin threatening each other . A few moments pass before a third guard appears from inside the bar and breaks up the fight . Neri gazes at them from afar as they walk westward , away from the coast , up the road . He crawls around a corner into an unassuming alleyway where he is to meet whoever the point man is . He notices that another person is hiding not so stealthily behind a crate , with the orange cat-like tail wagging back and forth excitedly . He steps towards her , making sure to hide his presence . She still does n't notice . She 's too busy giggling to herself about something nonsensical . <newline> <newline> Neri leans forward and whispers into the ear protruding from the top of her head , `` Ahem . '' <newline> <newline> The Felis jumps up with a yelp , and turns , Neri slams his hand up against her mouth and pushes her against the wall . <newline> <newline> “ What ’ s rule number one ? ” He slides his hands away from her mouth to her cheeks , pushing them tightly together so her fangs show through her pursed lips . She writhes in discomfort from having her whiskers twisted between his smooth fingers . `` Damn featherheaded cat , '' he whispers . He lets go of the woman and slaps her upside the head , the padding of her hood and her fur are enough to stifle the sound . `` The man in the crows nest is asleep . Tell Pal . '' She smiles and jumps up and down in excitement . Neri , whose patience has been tested long enough , slaps her head again . She yelps , and lowers her ears while cowering away from the clearly frustrated Lizian . `` Go ! '' He points , though the direction does n't matter . She should know where to go . She nods and jumps up the wall , scaling it nimbly . Neri shrugs and takes the same route to return to his partner . The three guards to the west are long gone , and there doesn ’ t seem to be another patrol in sight , but he still remains cautious and slithers down the dirt path the same way he went up it . <newline> <newline> The small mousy man is waiting for him in anticipation . `` Well ? Well ? How long ? '' Neri points to the crows nest . <newline> `` When he falls , we go . '' He sits back down on the ground inside the crates and sighs a long sigh . `` What 's with that tenderfoot ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , some people are excited for the first time on the job ... '' He trails off to nibble on his fingernails . <newline> <newline> 1.5 of 8 chapters <newline>

1,"( Just a short story about a tolkien style fantasy elf who somehow has found herself in modern New York , its the first short story I 've ever written so apologies if it seems juvenile . If you have any criticisms I 'd appreciate it if you told me . ) <newline> <newline> Effi was overwhelmed . All around her were megastructures of glass and steel that seemed to scrape the sky itself . Countless metal beasts in a variety of coulors rumbled down a road while at either side humans walked in and out of the structures in great numbers . She was surely a long way from her little elven village . Never before had she seen nor heard of such a place . Stumbling through the crowds , Effi found navigating her way around this strange new land a nightmare . She stopped inside one of the structures to get her bearings . The Interior seemed to have several isles stocked with small boxes and cases decorated with strange pictures and a dialect of writing she did not recognise . Humans lazily browsed up and down the aisles . Three more humans with bored expressions on their faces stood at the back of the building behind desks . Effi noticed an oddity , the humans of this land seemed much fairer in complexion than those she was familiar with . They were still short with rounded ears and less angular features , most however were significantly more kempt . A lack of dirty beards and greasy hair was evident . Their clothes were cleaner , more colourful and varied . She could not differentiate between the peasants from the noblemen . Could they have built these massive structures ? The thought of how they could accomplish such a task made her mind reel . If it was indeed the humans of this land who built it then they must have made significant use of sorcery . Enough to put even her clan ’ s most powerful mages to shame . She was broken out of her deep thought as she noticed someone approaching . A human boy paced toward her nervously , flinching as her gaze met his . “ uhh , hey ” He stuttered nervously . <newline> <newline> “ Speak ” Effi responded curtly . <newline> <newline> “ Your cosplay is great , do you mind if I take a picture ? ” <newline> <newline> After thinking for a minute , Effi decided it was probably a cultural norm in this place to “ take a picture ” with complete strangers . <newline> <newline> “ Very well , go ahead ” <newline> <newline> What the human did next confused Effi somewhat . He retrieved a strange object from the pocket of his jacket and aimed it at her . Instinctively , she reached for her dagger at her hip . As her hand made contact with the hilt a flash emitted from the device the human was using followed by a strange clicking sound . <newline> <newline> The human thanked her and was about leave when she stopped him by grabbing his shoulder and holding on firmly . <newline> <newline> The boy looked over his shoulder at her , a startled expression on his face . <newline> <newline> “ Where am I ? What land is this ? ” Effi asked . <newline> <newline> The boy continued to stare with that stupid shocked expression . She almost wanted to smack it off his face like it was an intruding insect . <newline> <newline> “ Tell me the name of this city ! ” she almost shouted . <newline> <newline> “ New…New York ! ” the boy hastily responded before adding quietly “ you ’ re making me uncomfortable and people are staring ” <newline> <newline> She held on for a moment but turned her head as she felt a presence behind her . <newline> <newline> “ Mam , Sir , I ’ m going to have to ask you to leave ” said a fat , bald , and tall human male . The human boy gave her a pressing look . <newline> <newline> “ Come on , let ’ s leave and I ’ ll tell you whatever you wan na know when we are outta here ” he urged her . <newline> <newline> “ Very well , but I have my eye on you . If you leave my sight and attempt to escape I will make you regret it ” She said reluctantly and ushered him out the door . <newline> <newline> The two moved through the crowds barely keeping together amidst the constant noise of honking and shouting until Effi pulled the boy into an alley and out of sight . <newline> <newline> “ Oh god , you ’ re going to mug me now aren ’ t you ? ” said the human . <newline> <newline> “ No , I merely want answers , for a start what is your name ? ” The elf responded . <newline> <newline> “ Mike , my names Mike… ” <newline> <newline> “ Thank you… Mike ” she pronounced his alien name slowly “ I am Effi Lynnara , Warlock of the clan Leaf upon the Wind . In what direction is the human city of Havenrock ? ” If she could find Havenrock then she would have no trouble getting home from there . <newline> <newline> Mike looked at her with that puzzled expression once more . “ I can ’ t tell if you ’ re being serious or you ’ re just really devoted to your character. ” <newline> <newline> “ I do not know what you mean ” the two stared awkwardly at each other for a few moments until the Elf said “ Is there a place we can eat near here ? Perhaps it would be easier to discuss such things on a full stomach. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , there ’ s a good pizza place just down the road a bit . I ’ ll lead the way ” Mike said with relief . <newline> <newline> Pizza ? Human cuisine , from her experience is crude but that actually sounded interesting . Effi thought to herself . This was going to be an interesting day indeed . <newline> <newline> Well this has been an interesting day so far . Mike thought to himself . This woman is a daunting puzzle , who or what is she ? She obviously can ’ t be an actual Elf , even though she damn well looked convincing , right down to the ears height and face . He was sure he wasn ’ t dreaming , his dreams were significantly more haphazard and surrealistic . Effi wasn ’ t just a pretty face in ornate armour , she was quite tall with defined muscles . He was pretty sure she was at least the same height as his high school football coach who was a menacing six foot three inches . Her face was almost immaculate save for a large scar that marred her features . He felt intimidated by her to say the very least and the more he looked at her the more convincing she seemed . <newline> <newline> They reached the restaurant , a large neon sign depicting two burly men in chef outfits and moustaches along with the name “ Dough Bros ” illuminated the front of the building . Possibly the brightest thing on the block . <newline> <newline> “ Alright this is it. ” Mike said as he turned to face Effi “ please don ’ t cause a scene. ” <newline> <newline> They walked in and a dishevelled greeter looked up from his phone , showed them to a booth near the back of the restaurant and handed them the menu . <newline> <newline> “ I can ’ t read this… ” Effi spoke up gesturing to the menu and looking frustrated . <newline> <newline> Mike who was engrossed in his copy almost jumped out of his seat . <newline> <newline> “ Umm… here lem me help you with that ” Mike insisted . <newline> <newline> “ So this one here is the margarita , that ’ s just a plain pizza with cheese an- ” <newline> <newline> “ What would you recommend ? ” she interrupted . <newline> <newline> “ umm ... well I ’ m having the pepperoni , that ’ s- “ <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ll have that ” <newline> <newline> “ Alright then , you got any money ” <newline> <newline> Effi looked at him blankly . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ll take that as a No. ” Mike said with a sigh . He assumed it would be in the best interests of his health not to say no to her . <newline> <newline> “ Fine I ’ ll pay ” he moaned . This was going to be an interesting day indeed , and Mike wasn ’ t sure if he ’ d live it through . <newline> <newline> The elf has an appetite , Mike thought to himself as he relaxed in his seat . She easily got through her own meal , and finished the half he left with great vigour . He had barely stuttered “ I can ’ t eat anymore ” before she snatched it up and devoured it in almost a minute . Mike gave her story some more thought . The more he looked at her the more he was convinced she was for real . She did not look human . Her features looked real . Her pointed ears did not look plastic , her elven eyes were certainly not contact lenses . He doubted anyone would go through all this effort to maintain their character and trick gullible people like him into buying her pizza . <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re for real , aren ’ t you ? ” He finally spoke up . <newline> <newline> “ Pardon ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re an honest to god legitimate… . Elf ” <newline> <newline> Effi narrowed her eyes . “ You seem surprised ” she responded . <newline> <newline> “ But that ’ s not possible…. ” <newline> <newline> Effi leaned forward and propped her head on her hands . “ Did your mother and father tell you we aren ’ t real ? It is not uncommon for humans to do that , they don ’ t want their children running off into the wilderness on an adventure to “ find the elves ” , I don ’ t blame them . The wilderness has many dangers . I could tell you a tale of the beast who gave me this. ” She traced her finger along a scar that began above her eye and ended halfway down her cheek . “ No… you don ’ t understand , Elves are meant to be a work of fiction . I ’ ve never heard of a city called Havenrock , you are a really long way from home . If you can even measure that with distance… look I can get you a map of our world , you can see for yourself ” Mike explained as he fumbled in his pockets for his cell phone . <newline> <newline> Effi leaned over , curious about this strange device the human possessed . Her eyes widened in surprise as a light emitted from the device revealing a picture of a furry creature staring right back at her . The picture quickly changed as the human went to work on it , the pictures changed as he tapped the device rapidly . Before she knew it she was looking at a map of some kind . As the human seemed to suggest , it was nothing like the maps she had seen of the world . <newline> <newline> “ This is where we are ” , the human said as he made a reverse pinching movement with his fingers on the western continent . <newline> <newline> Effi had seen enough and was now leaning back against her chair in deep thought as she attempted to process this information . It seemed as if she would be staying here for a while . She was going to miss her village , but this new world was strange and had many wonders . A smile graced her features as she considered her next move .

1,"SuperFam <newline> <newline> June 3rd , 1991 was generally anticipated by the general public to be a singularly ordinary day . It was a Monday , and while Chicagoans were sweltering in the heat that bounced from skyscraper to skyscraper , there was something altogether extraordinary bouncing from the thermosphere and into the mesosphere . Shoppers emerging from the many Marshall Field ’ s exits failed to notice the nearby comet sailing by the Sears Tower , and beachgoers were more preoccupied with volleyball than the sky , so that when that something extraordinary plopped , sprayed and subsequently steamed in the middle of Lake Michigan , few people noticed and even fewer people cared . <newline> In fact , it was a whole day later , Tuesday , which could be argued is a much better day for world-changing discoveries than Monday , that the first morning boat-tours from Navy Pier spotted the neglected silver orb a ways off in the equally neglected water . <newline> <newline> The captain phoned the police , who sent a boat out to investigate . After an hour and a half , the police phoned the FBI , who had agents there in two . The FBI , of course , being the FBI , didn ’ t phone anyone , least of all the CIA , but begun the process of extracting the something from the water and transporting it to a location that was probably a national secret . Before that could happen , however , another extraordinary something—although , after fifty years , he might now be considered ordinary , or at least normative at this point—floated down and briskly skipped from official boat to official boat until he found someone in charge . After all , X-Ray vision only distinguishes bone from flesh and flesh from metal , and everyone ’ s skeleton looks essentially the same . Don ’ t even get him started on the blind spots pencils used to cause before the thankful switch over to graphite . <newline> <newline> The lower FBI lemmings grumbled and moaned , probably because most of them were young men , but a few of the older officers straightened their backs and tucked their chins when addressing Superman . Sergeant First Class Morales , only outranking six other military titles , shifted uncomfortably in his military-grade boots when he saw some of the privates rolling their eyes . He would later assign them to kitchen detail , using some other arbitrary offense as justification for the punishment , without telling the underlings what actually agitated him , in classic American military fashion . The higher-ups remembered this gravity-deficient hero in his youth , back when things made sense—or no sense at all , depending on who you asked—but at any rate , the peppering of gray in his hair and the noticeable slump of fabric in his uniform signaled to all involved that they heyday had passed . Don ’ t worry , he looked good for his age , and maybe Kryptonians lived slightly longer than humans , but fifty-three years has a tendency to wear down even the most resilient . <newline> <newline> Clark had given up the charade of a secret identity long ago- facial recognition software could apparently see past a misplaced curl and a pair of glasses . It had frightened but astounded him , and with a shake of his head he marveled at the technological advances humans had made in such a short time . His father ’ s hologram back at the ice palace had had the same reaction , before voicing concerns about the excessive amount of water dripping down the walls . <newline> <newline> After a few brief words with the superiors , and a cordial call to the White House , Clark inspected the debris and capsule that had been hauled on deck . Poked here , prodded there , until his nimble fingers came across something that surprised him . He lifted a solitary finger before a red and blue blur replaced the space where his body had just been . Five minutes passed and again Clark was standing on deck in front of the crew like he had never left in the first place . The solitary finger was now replaced by a metallic pentagonal rod , which he slipped into a crevice near the front of the device . <newline> <newline> The metal broke and cracked in organized fissures , and steam hissed and spat out of the rifts . The separate parts opened up like a flower blooming , and the Major General behind Clark instinctively reached for his gun , despite the fact that he knew snipers on the upper deck of the ship were in position . <newline> When all the fuss had died down , and the mist in the air had cleared , Clark had his mouth gaping open , and was tentatively reaching down into the machine . When he retracted his iron arms , in his hands he held what looked like a small child , swaddled in an unearthly material , opening its eyes on this earth for the very first time . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> “ Joe , what the hell have I told you about smoking that stuff in the basement of my parent ’ s house ? ” <newline> Joe tentatively set down his favorite bong , a misty green tube which had a tiny little glass alien sitting on the slide , lighting his own little tiny glass bong with a laser gun . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s Marvin the Martian , Clark . It ’ s ironic. ” <newline> <newline> “ We all get it , you ’ re very clever ! ” Clark Kent ’ s voice was shrill and always a touch too loud with his begrudgingly adopted son . “ What I fail to understand is why you needed to bring it on your visit back to Kansas . My parents lived here , and they would have never put up with this crap. ” <newline> <newline> Clark lifted a slightly wrinkled hand to pinch the bridge of his nose in frustration . When that ship crashed down in 1992 , Jonathon and Martha Kent were too old to take care of even a regular human being , so Clark had stepped up to the plate in between hero sessions and Daily Planet articles . Twenty-two years of raising a hellion of a Kryptonian had laced his skin in liver spots and creases , and now the aging hero looked more human than he had ever looked before . <newline> <newline> Joe , or Loth-El in his native language , had always looked very human ; right down to his wrinkled plaid button-down with a wire surreptitiously placed in the collar so he could keep it mussed just-so , worn corduroy pants , and dirty old Vans . He would have gotten a tattoo , perhaps a sleeve or an emblem across his muscular chest , but after unsurprisingly breaking no less than ten of the artist ’ s needles , he had lost hope . <newline> <newline> “ Don ’ t worry , I just brought the essentials . Marvin , hemp rope dipped in cannabis oil—the butane in those lighters will really mess up your lungs , you know ? ” Joe retorted , absent-mindedly floating in the hazy basement air . <newline> <newline> “ Literally—and I mean that , literally—nothing can mess up your lungs , Loth-El. ” Within a fraction of a second , Clark angrily snatched Joe ’ s bong out of his drug-slowed grip , set it on the kitchen table upstairs and was back again . Joe made a mild whimper . “ You really need to stop smoking that stuff . People may not know me as Superman around here , but Kent is still a respected name. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , I know , I know . If someone saw me , you would probably shove a whole pound of Kryptonite down my throat. ” <newline> <newline> “ I would if you pushed me enough. ” <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s fucked up , Clark. ” Joe took a particular enjoyment in taking Clark ’ s eternal good intentions and twisting them into something dark . Testing the nerves of steel in the man of steel . “ Especially considering we ’ re the only two of our kind left. “ <newline> <newline> Clark sighed . He took a moment , turned his back , but then quickly turned back around to face Joe . <newline> <newline> “ I think you should try to do what I do . I know we ’ ve had this conversation a million times before , but I think you should come along with me , as Superman . I want you to learn something . I want you to do something . You have abilities , Joe , and you can change the world . Don ’ t you think it ’ s weird that you ’ re not harnessing any of your potential ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , super weird , ” Joe laughed at his own cleverness , which happened to be his favorite thing to laugh about . He straightened himself up , and floated down until his feet touched the unfinished concrete floor . His chin lifted , and he turned a stern look to the aging Kryptonian. “ There aren ’ t any super-villains anymore , Clark . Just regular old villains , and half the time , they look friendlier than the good people do . And sometimes there really aren ’ t any villains at all , just a little villain in a lot of good people , which collectively make the world a shittier place . It ’ s much more complicated than it used to be . How do I punch , I don ’ t know , systemic racism in the face ? How would I fucking laser-vision the world to see why child sex trafficking , or slave labor , or some other shit , is still a lucrative industry ? What about worldwide sexism , or uneven distribution of resources ? I ’ m faster than a speeding bullet , not a secure WiFi connection . I can ’ t do anything . So , it ’ s probably better if I just stay out of all of it. ” <newline> <newline> “ Now , ” Clark said , “ hold on just a second there . I have been on this planet for decades , and I ’ ve seen all these things change . I lived through the sixties . Decades ago , I heard Dr. King on the radio , and now , we have an African American President . Women used to be berated for wearing slacks instead of dresses . But nowadays , women can get any job they want , at least in this country , and this country is where we are . It ’ s the people here who we aim to protect . For heaven ’ s sake , I wear red , blue , and—well , yellow , but you get the point . We—well , I , sorry—have made it better than it once was . What have you done ? You sit there , or in your shitty apartment , and you smoke dope and you go online and complain about everything . At least I ’ m out there trying to keep change happening. ” <newline> <newline> “ Give me back my bong. ” <newline> <newline> “ This is exactly what I ’ m talking about. ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ll post something on my social justice blog. ” Joe made the signature ‘ V ’ for victory sign with both his hands , which Clark recognized , and then double-tapped them across each other , which Clark didn ’ t recognize at all . “ I ’ ll make a hashtag . Got ta stay woke. ” <newline> <newline> “ I don ’ t even know what any of that means. ” <newline> <newline> “ You want me to be involved ? Fine , get me involved . I ’ ll do a ride-along , ok ? ” <newline> <newline> ( To be continued ? ) <newline> <newline>

1,"Prologue : Epilogue <newline> <newline> <newline> At the end , your life flashes before your eyes ; or so they say . Your birth , your sixth birthday , your father ’ s funeral , your promotion at your job , and hundreds of other images speed by . Every thought and action you have ever made pass you , until they blur and mesh into the mess that was your life . And then , it ends . The light dies behind your eyes and you become a shell of your former self . This is how it worked for most people . But for some , death is only the beginning . <newline> <newline> <newline> Axel Thornberry bolts upright , gasping and coughing , forcing the air back into his lungs . Taking deep mouthfuls of air , he places a hand over his chest as if to stop his heart from jumping out . Opening his emerald eyes , he takes in his surroundings and is horrified by what he sees . Surrounding him are hundreds of dead bodies , stretching on for as far as his eyes can see . The floors , walls , and even the ceiling are caked with dried blood . The dangling florescent lights cast a pale red glow over the room . <newline> <newline> <newline> As his sense of smell returns to him , Axel goes to cover his nose , but pulls his hand back in shock . His hands are covered in dried blood . Many thoughts raced through his mind . How did he get into this room ? Was he responsible for all the blood and bodies ? What in the world is going on ? Placing his hands back down , Axel uses his hands as support to stand while carefully not touching the bodies . Looking down at his body , Axel ’ s eyes widen . His formerly lean and athletic body has become emaciated with his skin stretched tight over his bones . His clothes are dirty , bloody rags that barely offered any protection and that hung from him like curtains from a window . <newline> <newline> <newline> Closing his eyes , Axel tries to desperately think and remember how he came here . But all he draws is a blank ; a gap in his memory . As if his life had been ripped away from him violently and all he had left were the frayed ends . Sighing , Axel opens his eyes and looking around again . Across the field of bodies , he can barely see the outline of door . His mind begins to whirl at the possibilities of what may lay beyond that door . Maybe answers lie beyond that door . And it would be better to head through the door than stay in the room with the blood and bodies . <newline> <newline> <newline> Taking a few breaths to calm his nerves , Axel starts walking towards the door . He walks over the bodies of the fallen , his bare feet sinking slightly into each . He stares ahead , his eyes focused on the door and not the sound of soft squishing beneath him . When he reaches the door , Axel closes his eyes and breathes deeply again , willing himself not to look anywhere but the door before him . The door is—or rather was—painted white before the massacre of the room sprayed dark red blood over it . The blood on the door must have been dried , as it cracked and flaked off as Axel ’ s fingertips ran across it . <newline> <newline> <newline> Axel grips the door handle and pushes the door forward with surprising strength . It flies open and Axel tumbles face first through the doorway and onto the cold linoleum floor . Groaning , he pulls himself up only to scream at the scene before him . Like the room behind him , this room is covered in blood and dead bodies . The dark red liquid drips from the flickering florescent lights as if he were at nightclub run by vampires . <newline> <newline> <newline> Shakily he stands and closes his mouth tight . Whatever happened here was deadly to say the least and that he was the only survivor ; until a hand grabbed his right leg . Startled , Axel pulls his leg back and loses his footing on the slick floor . He tumbles backwards into a pile of decaying corpses , his leg still in the iron grip of the strange hand . He scrambles back , deeper into the corpse pile while flailing his right leg . The owner of the hand groans loudly before the grip is loosened and Axel pulls his leg closer to his body . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ What . . . ? ” Axel mumbles his voice hoarse from his screaming . The corpses in front of him begin to shift and Axel searches around for a weapon . Looking over his left shoulder he spots the butt of a rifle protruding out from some corpses . He scrambles towards it on all fours just as the hand swipes at him again . Axel pulls the rifle out of the pile of corpses and he grips it tightly . Turning around , he swings the rifle at his attacker . The wood on the rifle cracks loudly against the form and the hand drops with a thud . <newline> <newline> <newline> Releasing a breath he didn ’ t know he was holding , Axel pants . Lowering the rifle , he pokes at the form before him . It is a man dressed in a military uniform of blues and greens . This man—like everything else in the room—is soaked with blood . Axel pokes at the man again and leans in closer . The man ’ s head springs upwards and causes Axel to tumble backwards with his rifle flying somewhere behind him . He closes his eyes and begins to kick wildly at the military man . An iron grip grabs him by the left leg and another snatches his right arm . He thrashes harder against the man , but stops suddenly when he hears the man speak . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Stop . . . Reverent . . . . ” the man wheezes at Axel . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ What ? ” Axel asks hoarsely . He stares into the hazel eyes of the man before him as the man loosens his grip on Axel . <newline> <newline> <newline> The man closes his eyes , as if trying to find his words . “ Reverent , ” he wheezes as he slowly opens his eyes again . “ Please . . . Reverent . . . Help me. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> Axel shakes his head . “ I don ’ t . . . ” he begins to say but is interrupted by man again . <newline> <newline> <newline> The man places his cold hand on Axel ’ s warm cheek . “ Please , Reverent . It ’ s . . . me . Claus. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> Axel shakes his head again . “ Who ? ” he asks softly . “ I ’ m sorry . . . I don ’ t . . . . ” he lets his words trail off into silence . <newline> <newline> <newline> Claus looks perplexed and then the confusion falls from his face . “ My God , ” he mutters to himself . Pulling the hand from Axel ’ s face , Claus places it on his stomach and groans in pain . With his supporting arm shaking , Claus collapses before Axel . Claus lifts his head and stares at Axel . “ Those bastards . They did this to you . . . all of it . . . . ” He motions around the blood and body filled room with his head , before locking eyes with Axel again . <newline> <newline> <newline> Axel looks at Claus . “ I don ’ t understand. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> Claus nods his head in a sagely way and opens his mouth to speak when a low sound permeates the air . It sounds like a mix between growl and a howl and it stiffens Claus like a log . Casting his eyes to the far corner of the room , his breath quickens and beads of sweat begin to form on his forehead . “ Shit , ” he curses quietly and crawls over to Axel . “ I ’ m sorry , Reverent , but please trust me , ” Claus says as he climbs over Axel and places the smaller man beneath him . With his head in the crook of Axel ’ s neck , Claus wheezes into his ear . “ Don ’ t move . . . Reverent . And close . . . your eyes . Don ’ t look . . . at it. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> Feeling the weight of the strong man on top of him , Axel turns his head to the side slightly . His mouth opens to ask Claus what is happening when growl-howl get louder . The ground beneath him shudders with the stomping of two large feet . Closing his eyes , Axel desperately tries to hide from the noise , as if it unlocks some deep fear within . <newline> <newline> <newline> Stomping through the field of dead bodies , the creature snorts and snarls and its powerful nose sniffs at the air tracking Axel by his scent . However with the blood permeating the air , Axel is effectively scent blind to this creature . Growling , the creature stops . It looms over the tallest of men and elves with each of its limbs longer than any dwarf and it is covered in black coarse hair . Its dark red eyes dance across the dimly-lit room , the pupils widening to take in as much light as they could . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Reverent , ” it snarls in a deep and guttural voice , “ I know you ’ re here . I can smell you. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> Terrified of the voice of this creature , Axel begins to tremble . He trembles hard enough to gentle shake Claus . Feeling the lithe man shaking in fear , Claus slowly slides the tips of his cold fingers along Axel ’ s warm arm . “ Reverent , ” he wheezes , his hot breath tickling Axe ’ s ear , “ Stop . . . moving . . . . ” <newline> <newline> <newline> In the dead silence of the room , Claus ’ s wheezed voice sounds like an explosion from a cannon . The sound pricks at the sensitive ears of the creature . It snaps its head towards the bloody mound of Claus and Axel . It grins and its hound-like face nearly splits in two for the human emotion looks grotesque on such a creature . Chuckling , it swaggers forward slowly like a lion that has cornered its prey . “ Found you , ” it taunts in a sing-song voice . <newline> <newline> <newline> Suddenly however , the creature stops . It leans its head forward slightly and it narrows its eyes , looking intensely at some object beyond Axel and Claus . Its eyes widen and its head snaps backwards , with crack . Blue magical fire dances along its fur and it howls in pain , desperately trying to stamp it out . <newline> <newline> <newline> Picking up his head , Claus focuses on the new attacker . The newcomer is wrapped in a long blood red cloak that is currently parted in the middle . The man holds a smoking blunderbuss in his right gloved hand . Several runes glow brightly blue along the dark oak barrel . His left glove hand crackles with electricity . Peering closer , Claus can see the body of the man is covered in a dark drown hardened leather tunic and that sever fist sized stone and smaller grenades are strapped to his chest . With each step the man takes forward , Claus can barely see thick , dark leather boots with the occasional glint of a strapped dagger .
"
1,"And then , there was him . The Other People didn ’ t like to talk about him ; they liked to pretend he wasn ’ t there . They taught their children not to believe in him . They convinced themselves that he was simply a myth . But whether or not the simple , self-satisfying minds of the Others accepted his existence was irrelevant . Because here he was . And no matter how hard they thought about not thinking about him , he would never stop going about the business of existing . <newline> <newline> He called himself Aurgor , though the Other People called him something different . They had many names for him , actually . Some that were silly , some that weren ’ t . Some that made sense , some that didn ’ t . But for the purpose of the story we will stick with his most common Other title , a devil . Aurgor was not a devil so far as he knew . From what he understood of the People ’ s fantastical musings , devils were from a dark , lower place beneath the earth where creatures from outside the bounds of nature were spawned . It was true the Aurgor was from a lower , darker place than what the Other ’ s were used to , but he certainly wasn ’ t from beneath the earth . And as far as he understood all known laws of life applied to him , so he certainly was within the normal bounds of nature ; therefore , he couldn ’ t possibly be a devil , right ? <newline> <newline> Aurgor was , as far as he knew , the only one of his kind in this area . He knew he couldn ’ t have always been the only one because though Aurgor ’ s understandings were lowly , he knew the requirements for life and the reproduction thereof so his mind accepted the belief that somewhere else in the world were other Aurgors . He accepted it without any visible evidence beyond his existence , but that was enough for Aurgor . However , as it was in the present , Aurgor was alone . His appearance was one unique to his kind . From a distance he seemed one of the People , but close up one would find Aurgor ’ s bowed body to be covered in smooth blonde hair , much like the coat of a hound . His face was gaunt and his mouth opened up twice as wide as the Others ’ did . His protruded mouth housed a row of sharp teeth in front , four up top and five on the bottom , and ten thick molars in the back . His eyes were large and vibrant green . Atop his head was a shaggy mane of brown hair . His thin hands held six long , spindly fingers . His legs had two joints instead of one and bent in thirds rather than in halves with the lower third bending backwards rather than forwards like the Other ’ s single joint did . His feet were the only thing that seemed People-y , though he only had four toes and they were webbed . Aurgor liked to imagine that his fifth toes had somehow made it up to his hands and grown up there . This didn ’ t make very much sense so Aurgor didn ’ t imagine it very often . <newline> To return to a previous subject , to say Aurgor was alone wasn ’ t quite correct . There were quite a number of Other People here , but he disliked them just as much as they disliked him , albeit for different reasons . The Other People were loud and always moving . They always seemed to be either running towards him or away from him . In either case , they were annoying with their loud movement and Aurgor never stuck around any of them for very long . He wasn ’ t afraid of them , he simply didn ’ t like them . <newline> <newline> Aurgor lived in what he had always known to be Brookstone . Though the People called it by a different name . He lived in a lower , abandoned place beneath the busy streets , unseen and forgotten by the Other People : an old abandoned railway station , decorated by stone and marble . A beautiful place , even if it was built by Others . It was definitely more pleasing to the eye than the railway stations the Others used currently . This particular station had been abandoned before Aurgor had memory , which isn ’ t to say he wasn ’ t alive to see it occupied . <newline> Aurgor ’ s sense of time was distorted , he only saw the sun every so often and when he did he never had any idea how much time had passed since he saw it last . Aurgor ’ s understandings of the People ’ s methods of keeping time was vague . Their logic behind organizing the rising of each moon into three-hundred and sixty-five days was lost to Aurgor but from what he understood he believed he was somewhere between twenty-six and forty-two years old . <newline> <newline> Life in the station was a mundane one . He would spend his time gathering mold where he could find it and hunting tunnel-crawlers where he could find them . He would then combine the two with water , cook them into a food , which he called “ snraek , ” and eat it . He would do this whenever he had enough ingredients for a snraek . Sometimes the time between each snraek was long , sometimes it was very short . It depended on the season . The only time Aurgor did not eat snraek was when he ventured out of the Station , which was about every six or seven snraeks . That too depended on the season . Whenever he did go out he would find the most interesting thing he could and eat it . If he found that it wasn ’ t edible , he would keep it as a decoration for his station ; if he found that it was , well , it was eaten . What was interesting mostly depended on Aurgor ’ s mood . Sometimes what was interesting was what was the shiniest . Sometimes what was interesting was what smelled the best , or looked the strangest , or felt the softest . He found that some interesting tastes were often more edible while others were usually more decorative , as a result Aurgor ’ s hunger would also determine what was interesting . He tried his best to go out with the moon ; there weren ’ t as many Others out when the moon shone and the less he had to deal with them and their loud , screaming way of speaking the better . <newline> <newline> This is also something to note . Aurgor ’ s favorite thing to talk to , for there weren ’ t any other Aurgors to talk to , was his reflection . He found his voice smooth and warm as it echoed off his station ’ s walls . He would verbally take count of how many tunnel-crawlers he had caught for this snraek or outwardly reflect about his last outing . He found that his reflection was a very good listener , for whenever he looked at it , it was always staring at him attentively . <newline> It was during a particularly good snraek-time that something unimaginable happened to Aurgor . Aurgor actually believed that had it not been for the goodness of the snraek , the event would have probably gone a lot worse . As he was talking to his reflection about a particularly ill-tempered , long tailed tunnel-crawler he had caught his ears picked up the sound of something walking towards his station from the farthest entrance . At first he dismissed it , but then his mind grasped the reality of the sound . Something was in his station ! Somehow , and Aurgor couldn ’ t imagine how , some foreign entity had found its way through the maze of tunnels , collapsed doorways , blocked paths , and crumbled walls into his abode . This did not sit well with Aurgor . In stunned silence Aurgor listened to the thing walk closer and closer to where he was standing . He was sure it was drawn to the light of his snraek-fire . After sixty-seven beats of Aurgor ’ s heart , an Other walked into the light of Aurgor ’ s station . At first it stared at the camp in bewilderment , then it saw Aurgor standing just outside of the ring of light . It spoke it ’ s screaming voice . He had heard this particular cry a thousand times but he was never able to determine a meaning beyond identifying the males from the females . The males and a low voice and the females had a high one . This particular Other was a female and her cry echoed wildly around Aurgor ’ s station . <newline> <newline> Aurgor moaned . Great , now there was this Other scaring away all the tunnel-crawlers with her loud way of speaking . Half-heartedly Aurgor said “ Baaahhhhh saku re. ” which roughly translates to “ Aaaahhhh to you too. ” This caused the Other to immediately stop talking . She stared at Aurgor for twenty heartbeats , her face a perfect example of surprise . And then she did something Aurgor didn ’ t know the People were capable of , she spoke softly . And by softly , we mean at the same level that Aurgor did . In a normal , smooth voice . This , in turn , surprised Aurgor . He looked at her , intently examining her face . Was she some sort of youngling , still developing her voice ? Aurgor wasn ’ t sure the Other People grew that way , but this one seemed tall enough to be full grown so he held the idea loosely . Aurgor responded to it with “ May sanechan re tolas eko ci. ” The Other made a gasping sound followed by a short sound , high and happy . The closest thing Aurgor could compare it to was the joy-sound he made when something delightful happened . Whatever the sound meant , Aurgor felt the tension in his station ease , which was excellent for Aurgor was terribly opposed to tension ; this caused Aurgor to make his joy-sound . That one sound was enough to melt away the rest of the tension in the room leaving only curiosity . Why was this Other in his station ? How did she get here ? Why wasn ’ t she running like all the others did ? After a while the Other made more sounds , they sounded like “ Ummm-hehheh ” and “ Jo. ” He looked at her , puzzled . He could never quite figure out their language , everything he knew about them he learned through observation and imagery . She motioned with her small hands , pointing at her chest . “ Jo. ” It didn ’ t take Aurgor long to realize that she was pointing at herself saying , “ Jo. ” It was only logical that she calling herself “ Jo , ” So Aurgor responded in turn . Perhaps this was how the Other People made greeted each other . “ Aurgor , ” he said making the same gesture that Jo did . Her eyes went wide and she made that joy-sound again . “ Aurgor ” she said . The word sounded strange coming from her but she was saying his name well enough . Aurgor grinned and tested her , gesturing with his hands to point at her . “ Jo. ” He said in his deep , smooth voice . She once again made a joy-sound and made the same gesture saying , “ Aurgor. ” Aurgor hummed in satisfaction , this Other was catching on quickly . <newline> <newline> And that is how Aurgor met Jo .

1,"My name is Fred . <newline> <newline> I 'm 26 , and I 'm at a party . <newline> <newline> I moved to Vancouver from the southern US about a year ago . I had to leave to get away from my family - we were very isolated in our little southern town , and I wanted to get out and meet people and have sex with pretty girls . <newline> <newline> I was reasonably successful at this - I 'd had a couple encounters , but nothing terribly noteworthy . Enough to keep me coming to parties . <newline> <newline> But I was really looking for love . That closeness was something I missed when I left home . My parents were awful , but my sister and I always got along really well , we were close , but I left home while she decided to stay in town . She was ... a little crazy . She was a social butterfly and her decision to stay in such a small town baffled me , and I think it made her a little stir crazy . <newline> <newline> But suddenly , in the middle of my reminiscing , I saw her walk in the front door of the party , a girl in one arm , and a guy in the other . <newline> <newline> I did a double take - what the fuck was she doing here ? <newline> <newline> I made my way over to her . My chest was tight - how did she get here ? Why did n't she tell me she was coming ? Did she know I was here ? <newline> <newline> What the hell ? <newline> <newline> Maybe it was n't her . <newline> <newline> But as I rounded the corner , I knew that it was . Her bright pink , chest-length , curly hair was a dead giveaway . She was wearing a black dress with a low cut in front . It hugged her whole body in a way that I could see made some jealous , and others envious . <newline> <newline> She 'd always been gorgeous . <newline> <newline> `` Jessica ? '' <newline> <newline> She spun around on her heels , a smile already on her face . <newline> <newline> She knew I was here . <newline> <newline> `` Fred ! Hi ! It 's been so long , it 's so good to see you ! '' <newline> <newline> She embraced me , then gave me a kiss on the lips . <newline> <newline> I was shocked . <newline> <newline> Her companions shrugged , took each others ' hand , and walked into the party . <newline> <newline> Her eyebrow was cocked slightly , in that way that says she as a nefarious idea . I 'd seen that face many times , just before we got in trouble . <newline> <newline> `` Jess , what the- '' <newline> <newline> `` Come on now Fred . I know it 's been a while but we 're all having fun here ! I mean , it 's not like you 're my brother or anything . You 're just my ex ! A little awkward I guess , but that was years ago . Loosen up ! Have some fun ! '' <newline> <newline> My eyes went wide and my eyebrows went up . My heart was pounding in my ears . I could still taste the raspberry lipstick she always wore . <newline> <newline> She had kissed me before . <newline> <newline> But never in public . <newline> <newline> She leaned in close , put her arm around my waist , and pulled me close to her . I could smell her perfume , light and fruity , and I could see the details on her purple winged eyeliner and eyeshadow . My arms fell naturally around her waist . <newline> <newline> Fuck , she was so gorgeous . <newline> <newline> I 've always felt this way about my sister . <newline> <newline> I missed holding her like this . <newline> <newline> I left to get away from these feelings . I ca n't be in love with , or attracted to , my sister . <newline> <newline> `` Come on Fred . Let 's go get a drink , shall we ? '' <newline> <newline> Still in shock , I ca n't think of anything to do but agree . It 'd been less than 5 minutes since I first saw her , and already things were moving pretty fast . <newline> <newline> `` Hey hey Fred , nice arm candy there ! Daaaaamn ! '' <newline> <newline> I did my best to look relaxed . <newline> <newline> `` Come on Jessica ... this is crazy . What if someone here ... knows us ? '' <newline> <newline> `` What are the odds of that ? We 're over 4,000 miles away , in a different country . '' <newline> <newline> `` I dunno . You 're here . '' I said in accusatory tone . <newline> <newline> We 'd made it to the drinks area , and she started to pour some punch into a couple cups for us . <newline> <newline> `` Ugh . You 're always so worried , Fred . Just relax for once , maybe ? '' <newline> <newline> I leaned in close so I could whisper in her ear . <newline> <newline> `` Jessica this is fucking crazy . We ca n't be doing this ! Not in public ! I left so that I would n't have to- '' <newline> <newline> I felt her body shudder . She turned her head slightly to make eye contact with me over her shoulder . `` You ca n't go whispering in my ear like that without turning me on . You know that . '' She shifted her hips slightly to press her ass into my lap . Her body shuddered again . <newline> <newline> With a smile , she took a sip from her drink . <newline> <newline> I was frozen . <newline> <newline> She turned around fully , leaning back against the table to face me . Looking me in the eyes , she started to chant `` Chug ! Chug ! Chug ! '' . It took five seconds for the rest of the party to join in , and I chug my drink somewhat reluctantly , followed seconds later by Jessica . <newline> <newline> `` Now that was n't so hard , was it Freddy ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Damnit Jessica if people start calling me that again ... '' <newline> <newline> She smiled at me evilly again , one eyebrow raised . <newline> <newline> `` You know this is a nice house . I 'm friends with the girl who lives here . Want a tour ? '' <newline> <newline> Without waiting for me to respond , she took my hand , and lead me upstairs . <newline> <newline> It was a truly beautiful mansion . Teak and mahogany and cherry everywhere . Huge rooms , a grand piano , and a second floor indoor balcony that looks down onto the first floor . <newline> <newline> `` ... And this is the master bedroom ! '' Jess said , gesturing grandly as she entered . <newline> <newline> I was ready for her to make a move - but she made none , just continued to point and describe and oohh and aahh . I started to relax . <newline> <newline> Leaving the master bedroom , I felt ... disappointed . <newline> <newline> Why ... <newline> <newline> She leaned against the balcony railing , showing herself to me . I could imagine the milky white skin under her clothes , soft and delicate . Her B-sized breasts were the most modest thing about her . Everything else , from her black-and-steel chainmail collar to the long , dangling earrings , the deep V in her dress , and how she was standing , screamed at me to fuck her . <newline> <newline> `` Whatcha thinkin ' 'bout , Freddy ? '' she said , smiling evilly once again . <newline> <newline> `` Jessica , what the fuck are - '' <newline> <newline> Jessica rolled her eyes , reached for my hand , and took it , pulling me closer . <newline> <newline> Her expression softened . <newline> <newline> She kissed me gently , lightly biting my lip and holding me close with her arms , her pink hair framing us . `` It 's ok Fred . I know how you feel about me . I know , when we were young ... things were weird . We were both so lonely . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah . '' <newline> <newline> `` And when you left , I just ... I just wanted you to come back . The people in that town ... ugh . And the other people I 've met ... They 're just so empty . You , you seem so much more , alive I guess . I missed you . I missed everything . I do n't care what people think - I do n't care if people know . But I love you , Fred . It 's weird and it sucks - but I can see you feel the same way . Why lie to ourselves about this ? Why stay apart from someone who loves us for who we really are ? No games , no pretending - Just you , and just me . '' <newline> <newline> She kissed me again . <newline> <newline> `` Jessica , geez , I ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Fred , I want you to come into the master bedroom with me , and I want us to make love . We 've played before , we even got caught that once ... but we 've never had sex . And I want it . I want you . I want you inside of me . '' <newline> <newline> I felt like I could cry . <newline> <newline> I thought ... Is n't this crazy ? <newline> <newline> `` Jessica , come on , you ca n't be serious . You 're one of the hottest girls here . You can have anyone . Why me ? Why ... your ... '' <newline> <newline> She took my hand , and started to lead me towards the door to the master bedroom . A couple whistles from the lower floor made their way up . They had no idea . <newline> <newline> `` Brother ? Well . I do n't care about that stuff . I care about loving someone who deserves to be loved and someone loving me the way I deserve it . And that person is you . '' <newline> <newline> She opened the door to the master bedroom , and closed it behind us . <newline> <newline> She slipped her dress off one shoulder , then the other , allowing it to fall to the floor . She stood in front of me in only a black thong . <newline> <newline> She walked towards me , and started to unbutton my shirt and pants . We moved slowly , there was no rush . No parents to interrupt us , no one knows who we are . <newline> <newline> I kissed her , laying her onto the bed , and we made love gently , lovingly , with care . After that though , things got more intense each time . We 'd fall asleep for a bit , then wake up , see each other , remember what happened , smile , then kiss , then ... well , you get the idea . By the time the sun was coming up again , the sound of flesh slamming into flesh seemed like it was filling the now-quiet house , punctuated only by moans of pleasure and temporary periods of silence . <newline> <newline> We slept in till past noon . <newline> <newline> And were woken by the door opening . <newline> <newline> `` Jessica ! ? What are you doing in my parents ' bed ? ! I thought I told you- '' <newline> <newline> She stopped for a second , staring at me . <newline> <newline> `` Jessica ! Is n't that ... your brother ? ! ''
"
1,"`` Here it is . '' I say as I pull out the picture in my bedroom drawer . <newline> <newline> I look behind to find my best friend , Shawn , looking at me skeptically . <newline> <newline> A lot of people always calls us brothers especially back during elementary . He and I have short black hair and slightly lean builds , though he gained a little plump a couple years later . Now 'best friends ' sounds better on us . <newline> <newline> `` Please do n't judge , Shawn , '' I say with a sigh , `` I told you I 'll tell you more when get into it . '' <newline> <newline> His expression does n't change but he willingly walks up to me and slings an arm over my shoulder . I hold the image up to over eye level . <newline> <newline> `` Just follow my lead and stare into the photo . '' I say , looking back at him to make sure that he keeps his eyes on it before focusing . <newline> <newline> Slowly , the photo begins getting brighter and starts pulsating as I start to hear voices . I just hope that Shawn does n't chicken out in the middle of this . Eventually , the photo turns into a bright flash of light . <newline> <newline> When it fades , I slowly adjust to my new surroundings . Pretty much what you would expect from a new mall , lots of stalls , behind me is an advertisement about something opening in the city . <newline> <newline> `` Whoa ... '' I turn to the direction of the voice to find a guy around his early twenties , a couple inches taller than me , and looks at his arms in amazement and confusion . It does n't take long for him to notice me staring at him . <newline> <newline> `` Connor ... ? '' He asks doubtfully . <newline> <newline> I immediately nod at him with a smile . <newline> <newline> He walks up to me with a completely dumbfounded expression on his face , he reaches out his hand to my face but I grab it by the wrist . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , it 's me , Shawn , '' I scold him in my new voice , `` do n't be weird about it , we 're in a mall . '' <newline> <newline> `` D-dude , I just ... I know I had my doubts about whatever you said you could do but now that I 'm actually in it is just ... '' He stops to make a gesture of him shooting his brains out . Honestly , it looks totally bizarre seeing someone other than Shawn doing it , or maybe I 'm just used to seeing him do it in his real body . <newline> <newline> Looking down , I find a phone on the floor , I reach down to pick it up . When I flip it over , the phone shows the image I used to get me and Shawn here . I immediately turn off the passcode setting on it before handing it over to Shawn . I 've been to this moment a couple of times , it took some trial and error before I could memorize the passcode on our new phones . <newline> <newline> He smiles like a kid getting their favorite candy and takes it off my hands , `` No bullshit , this is actually mine , right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , technically , it 's belongs to the body your ... '' I cut myself off while shaking my head , `` Yes , it is . Just do n't make me go into detail about this , okay ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait a minute ... '' Shawn mutters as he checks his phone , `` 2014 ? Did we like , time travel ? Or it is just my phone going nuts ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well here goes ... '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't just send our minds into our people 's bodies , we 're also sent back to the exact time the photo was taken . '' <newline> <newline> His face lights up at the thought of time travel . `` So , we can like change our pasts ? Dude , this power of yours ... '' <newline> <newline> I cut him off right there , `` It does n't work like that . Whatever we do now does n't change the future . We 're just hitchhikers of this time period . '' <newline> <newline> He seems disappointed but it quickly fades away . `` So how long can we stay in here ? '' <newline> <newline> I shake my head , `` I do n't actually know to be honest , I 've always stayed in a photo for at least an hour or two . There 's got to be boundaries to my powers but I 'm not taking any risks . '' <newline> <newline> He pats me in the back , `` So let 's enjoy all the time we have ! '' <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> I have been in this photo a couple of times by myself , so I always had to play Joshua with Karl ( the guy who 's currently Shawn ) . So it was a strange mix of euphoria , bizarreness , and camaraderie when I could be myself as Connor while being Joshua at the same time . <newline> <newline> The photos were like a save state , everything happening in that moment were maintained until someone travels back into it . For example , hunger . I initially thought the hunger was just Joshua 's problem in this moment but when Shawn suggested that we should eat lunch , turns out Karl was hungry too but did n't bring it up , or they both ate after I left this moment . <newline> <newline> `` So when did you discover your ability ? '' Shawn asks me before taking a bite out of a pizza slice . <newline> <newline> I did n't respond as I stare at the pizza toppings . I left it to Shawn to pick what he wanted on it . But I 'm slightly regretting that decision . <newline> <newline> Shellfish . <newline> <newline> I 've always been allergic to shellfish the aftermath was n't life-threatening but it was always a burden . The sensation of internal swelling gives me nightmares . <newline> <newline> I did n't realize that I was staring at pizza long enough for Shawn to notice . <newline> <newline> `` Wait ... You have n't realized ? '' He remarks . <newline> <newline> `` Realized what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Dude , you do n't have Connor 's allergies anymore . Joshua never had any , right ? '' <newline> <newline> It was weird that he referred both 'me 's ' in the third person but his point stands . Allergies go with the body not the mind , so I 'm not allergic to shellfish right now . <newline> <newline> I was hesitant when he grabs a fresh slice and leaves it on my plate . Looking at Shawn , he 's literally waiting for me to take a bite out of it . <newline> <newline> I knew that he was right but for some reason I was scared . I did n't want to deal with an allergic reaction when we 're having the time of our lives , yet his argument keeps nagging me in the face . <newline> <newline> 'One small bite , ' I thought to myself . <newline> <newline> I was still a kid when I found out about my allergies , so this was getting out of my comfort zone . <newline> <newline> It was a really wimpy attempt , I took a bite with my eyes closed . The taste of cheese was dominant but there was a taste of meat albeit it was salty , like sea salt salty , for some reason it goes pretty well with it . <newline> <newline> `` Well , how 's your experience with shellfish for the first time in years ? '' He says triumphantly . <newline> <newline> There was still that hovering fear of my allergies kicking in , but I was n't going to give him the time in the sun . So I took another bite , and another ... Until I finished the slice . When I did , I have n't thought about my fear at all . <newline> <newline> `` I completely forgot how it was , Ka ... Shawn . '' I correct myself . <newline> <newline> He leans forward a bit , `` C'mon , get into character , Josh . '' He mutters audibly to me . <newline> <newline> Honestly , being called 'Josh ' felt really natural , I think it 's because I 've travelled to different moments of his life already . Reason ? I found a box containing a lot of photos of random and relevant moments of his life after we moved in . <newline> <newline> I lean forward too , `` You can stop leaning now , SK . '' <newline> <newline> He leans back and laughs mildly , `` Shawn Karl ... I kinda like the sound of that , CJ . '' He retaliates . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't think Connor John really clicks , '' I rebut . <newline> <newline> `` You got me there . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ha ! So I get another slice from your half . '' I say and grab the slice but Shawn stops me . <newline> <newline> `` Like hell , I 'm gon na let you do that . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , well a big guy 's got ta eat . '' I 'm older than him by a few months . <newline> <newline> To my surprise , he pulls out his phone and shows me the picture we to jump in . `` This picture says that I 'm taller and older . '' <newline> <newline> `` Dammit . '' I mutter . `` Touché . '' <newline> <newline> We laughed it off in the end . But he actually gets away with a slice from my half while was telling him my other stories from my previous visits . I did n't notice until I wanted to grab a slice and realizing it was gone . <newline> <newline> `` You win this round , Karl . '' I admit . <newline> <newline> He slouches back on his seat , `` What now , Josh ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I guess we should head back . Let 's not risk it . '' <newline> <newline> `` How are we gon na head back ? '' He asks . <newline> <newline> `` The same way we got in . '' <newline> <newline> He pulls out his phone and shows me the picture . He slings his arm just like before , we both stare into the photo and the exact same thing happens . The next thing we knew , we were back in my bedroom . <newline> <newline> Another thing about my ability is that time does n't pass when we travel . But needless to say , Shawn 's mentally exhausted from the experience . <newline> <newline> He sighs , `` Back to being short and young again . '' <newline> <newline> `` It was worth it though . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . Yes it was , Joshua . '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay , I think you had one slice too many back there . '' <newline> <newline> He laughs out loud but says goodbye to me shortly afterwards . <newline> <newline> `` Another round , next time ? '' He asks . <newline> <newline> I smile . `` Definitely . '' <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> It 's just something I wrote from a prompt I found after lurking for sometime .

1,"Letters to a Mentor <newline> <newline> I find it odd that I write this to you , since we do n't really talk anymore . I was reminded of the days when you and I would just hang out , do n't you remember teacher ? do you remember me ? I would hope so , after 4 years in high school , I 'm finally in the place I can finally call home ... All the things you taught me still linger in my head to this day . I still remember my apprenticeship with you . Maybe you do n't , but that 's just fine as well . I would n't think it odd after 10 years passing . So I thought I would update you on what has happened in these 10 years . <newline> <newline> <newline> When I had first gotten into university , I remember you telling me that my days in uni were going to be the best years of my life . I recall that in high school , while i did have `` friends '' , they were n't the kind of people you would hang out with simply because of their hypocrisy . So I dropped almost all of them like a sack of hammers ! ! <newline> I did make new friends , people who actually cared about me , they gave me something more than those who had come before them . These people had actually treated me like I meant something to them , or at least for a time . See my group of friends and I had dissipated from our time hanging out mostly due to ours schedules being so different , but we still keep in touch , it 's funny because they reach out to me more than I reach out to them , I do n't know if that makes me rude , but for the first time people actually look for me , and that I found to be nice . <newline> I also took a bunch of classes in art , applying the skills you had taught me , I still even have the book you gave me the last day we saw each other on my graduation `` Advanced Drawing ; A Course In Artistic Excellence '' , you are still my favorite artist to this day , and still my inspiration . Although I 'm not following in your footsteps and going into Animation and Illustration , I decided on something similar ; Advertisement and Graphic Design , with illustration as a minor . Sometimes I felt less determined in uni , but I always remembered the words you told me `` that 's gon na happen , when that does , you need to meditate , and get back to where our love for art all began , only then can that fire be re-ignited , and sometimes you have to dig deep to find that which you once loved before . '' I do that now even in the workplace , it turned out pretty helpful . Toward the end of my first year of uni , I had done alright , but honestly , I know I could have done better , if I could go back and do better , I would , I made so many mistakes , you would n't be proud of me , but I hope in the end I did alright . <newline> <newline> <newline> Second year of uni was actually pretty swell . I felt reborn in a sense , I was determined throughout the whole year , that was until , I had gotten a new job at a pizza place . Let me tell you , they treated us like payed slaves , no amount of money could ever make me want to be treated that way ever again . However , after I quit that job I got a job at a senior center , I worked in activities , and that was one of the best jobs I had ever had . My second year came with hurdles , I always found myself discovering something new about myself , and that was because you had suggested that I become open minded to all aspects of life , and so I did , and still am . Your teachings are still relevant into my adult life . <newline> <newline> <newline> My third year of uni was actually special . It was the year I had met my wife of 5 years . Do you wan na know how we actually met ? We met in bio class , and every Monday and Wednesday , we sat next to each other , and every Monday and Wednesday I would draw her , she turned out to be a good muse for my art . I finally got the stones to talk to her , I 'm surprised the she did n't noticed a creepy gent like myself drawing her two days a week . She was interested in me and we started going out , if did n't have the confidence to do that I probably would have never done that , you did that.. you had taught me how to smooth with the ladies , and as corny as that sounds , it helped . I mean I had three different relationships in high school , I 'm sure you remember . However , this was different , she was different . She was determined , she had a fire in her to that I had never seen in anyone before . When I had gotten to the point of no return , she brought me back . She much like you , saved me . I know you do n't want to hear me say it , but I am truly grateful for that , for saving me from myself . <newline> <newline> <newline> Fourth year at uni was my final year , it was the final curtain call , I was determined to go out in a blaze of glory . During this time I was building up a portfolio in order to find some work , along with personalizing my resume . I had everything prepared , and I was finally ready to wrap up uni . I had plans to moved out to Washington State , and finish my MA there , while looking for work as a freelance , while trying to start up my own ad agency . It was time for me to move on from this place , I did all I had to do there . I was ready to set sail on new waters . Finally the day came , graduation , that most important day for me and my peers who were forced by our parents to walk for the sake of a picture . Some of my friends had came to see me and my friends who were walking . I had invited you , but you were busy that day , it 's ok , I understand , you were a family man . For that I could n't be more understanding , your family will always come first . I wished we coulda saw each other before I left for Washington state ( also I do n't know why people get so trounced when I say Washington , they instantly assume D.C. ) . That 's ok too , I had emailed you , but you had never answered , it 's ok I assumed you were busy with that too . Eventually I just had stopped contacting you once I got out to Washington , even when I got settled in . I really do apologize for that . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> After a year in Washington , I had finally asked my wife to marry , me , and she actually said no the first time , to which I was a little taken back by it . She had waited 2 months until finally she proposed to me , to which I was then surprised , of course I said yes , I love her , yea it is non-traditional , but hey , who is anyone to judge me , we got married really quick , just a small courthouse wedding , it was quaint , serene , but also romantic in every way . After a year , I finally became a father of two twins , a boy and a girl , Heather , and James I 'm pretty sure you would have loved them . They are cute kids , but boy let me tell you , those nine months were a little hellish on both my wife and I , mostly my wife though , I ca n't imagine what she was feeling during that time . However , when those beautiful kids came out of her womb , she did n't want to let them go ! She even started crying when they had to take the kids away to clean them and put them in a incubator to make sure they were healthy , she cried for 2 hours until she fell asleep ! ! Ha ! how cute and funny ! But man once those babies were out in the world , eyes wide open as if they were ready for whatever the world was to throw at them , it was very.. perfect . This is while I was still going to school , although I was almost done with my MA and my wife was still working on her doctorate . We managed to figure it all out . My mother decided to stay with us for a year in our condo , while were doing school and work , to take care of our kids . It helped quite alot . <newline> <newline> <newline> My kids are now four years old , and we are visiting our old home town , you know where you and I met . Where me and my wife met . It 's funny , I used to hate this town for all the pain it gave me , but it gave me some of the greatest gifts I will ever have . I guy like me does n't deserve any of that . I finally understand what you were teaching me , you did n't just teach me art , you taught me about what it meant to be alive , and since I met you all those years ago , I have been able to breathe , and to live . Even though you are gone now , and I wo n't ever get the chance to really talk to you , it was a good life , I 'm glad , you gave me a good life , and I gave myself a brighter future than the one I was going down prior to us meeting . I made this letter to sort of make peace with you and in my own way , talk with you one last time . Thank you for everything , for an amazing life , for your kindness , patience , and inspiration . My family and I decided to move back down here , I 'm going to start my first day of teaching art classes at the local high both you and I attended , and where we first met , and where your son will be attending his first day of high school . I guess things always do come full circle . I just hope I could be half the teacher that you were , if i could do for kids what you did for me all those years ago , that would be just fine . I will never forget you , I hope in your last days you never forgot me . <newline> <newline> <newline> With love , <newline> Joeseph . <newline> <newline> edit : This is my first time doing something like this . I hope i did ok .

1,"Light is filtering through my closed lids , alerting me to the presence of a new day . I keep my eyes closed for a few minutes , luxuriating in the feel of my cotton sheets , thick pillows and firm but squidgy mattress . I love my bed . All told it cost me more than most of the rest of my furniture combined , but it was worth it . As I open my eyes and stretch my waking muscles , a trickle of unease seeps into my mind . The light is wrong . Why are my curtains open ? <newline> <newline> I sit up and look at the big bay window . The curtains are pulled all the way back , showing me my overgrown garden . The nets are pulled back too . I never pull the nets back and I always close my curtains at night . What was going through my mind when I settled for bed last night ? <newline> <newline> I live alone , and while I 'm not exactly in the wilderness , the beaten track is n't all that visible from my viewpoint either . Locking doors and windows and drawing curtains as soon as it 's getting dark are motions that for me are as automatic as breathing . <newline> <newline> I pull the nets back into place and continue about my morning routine , shaking my head at the brain fart . We all get them from time to time . <newline> <newline> I 'm working from home today and I plough through my tasks for the morning , before locking the house up to go for my lunchtime run . I check the bowls of meat and water that I leave out for the family of hedgehogs that live around my garden . All empty . Hopefully the hedgehogs got to them before the other local wildlife . <newline> <newline> As I step off my porch I notice that the flower pots by my door have been trashed . Dug up by an animal by the looks of it . There 's earth scattered everywhere and what flowers remain are mangled . Scraps of hydrangeas and sweet peas are scattered across the wooden boards . I sigh . I have the opposite of a green thumb , despite having the best of intentions , and I had been inordinately proud of keeping these humble plants alive . I 'll deal with this when I come back . I lock the doors , standard lock and deadbolt , and set off , heading for the tree line that backs onto my garden . <newline> <newline> I notice a few dead rodents along the way and a small dead cat . The rodents I pass by without too much thought but the cat catches my attention . It 's curled tightly into a ball , it 's eyes are wide and bulging and it looks to have died in agony , but I do n't see a mark on it . Maybe it ate something poisonous . <newline> <newline> I return home with a heavy heart , made heavier by the sight of my ruined plants when I approach the porch . I unlock the doors and grab my sweeping brush . I 'll empty the pots out and start again . I pick up two of the pots and carry them off the porch to dump the earth out . As the earth hits the ground in a series of small clumps , I hear a thud that 's suggestive of an object heavier and denser than a clod of earth . I cast my eyes down and am met with the sight of the hedgehog matriarch , who I 'd affectionately named Bristles . We 'd become fast friends over the two years I 'd lived here , and she was tame enough that she would take food from my hand on occasion . She 'd had her babies in a blanket lined box on my porch , and still spent many a night in that box with her little family . She too was curled up as though in agony and as I dumped out the rest of the pots , I was greeted with the rest of her family . <newline> <newline> I was halfway through burying them before it occurred to me that the sides of the pots were far too high for them to have found their way inside them by themselves . <newline> <newline> I retreat to the house , locking the door and double and triple checking the locks on the back door and windows . I call my best friend and coworker , Dan , to have someone to share my worries with . <newline> <newline> He empathises with me , knowing how much I love those cute little bastards , but assures me it was probably an animal burying its kills . <newline> <newline> `` Annie it 's winter , it 's cold and food is thin on the ground . It 's just a fox or a cat saving itself some food for later . Take the rest of the day to yourself and try to get an early night . You 'll feel better tomorrow . '' <newline> <newline> He is so convincing that I begin to feel foolish and completely forget to mention about the curtains and the other dead animals . It 's probably nothing anyway . I take his advice and for good measure I take a sleeping pill and am drifting off before the light of the sun has even departed for the day . <newline> <newline> When I wake I feel groggy and heavy , like there are weights strapped to my limbs . It 's still quite early and the sun has n't quite cleared the horizon yet , lending what light there is a misty , grey quality . I bolt upright , adrenaline coursing through me , chasing away the cobwebs of sleep . The curtains are open and the nets have gone , disappeared entirely . <newline> <newline> I can see that the window does n't look quite right and I stumble from my bed , peering blearily through eyes still crusty and blurry from sleeping like the dead . I can just make out , in the grey dawn light , a smeared handprint , and a foot or so above it , fading condensation , as though someone has just breathed on the cold glass . I draw my finger through the misty patch . It 's on the inside of the glass . <newline> <newline> I step back , heart in my mouth , breathing too quickly I know , but I ca n't slow it down . I check my wardrobe and beneath my bed , finding nothing as I dial those three numbers , so rarely used by me and yet so well known , and sit on my bed , drawing my knees to my chest and trying to keep calm . There is no mobile phone signal out here , so I use the landline phone next to my bed . <newline> <newline> A gruff male voice answers . He sounds slightly familiar but I ca n't place him . <newline> <newline> `` Please help me , I think someone has been in my house while I was asleep ! '' I breathlessly run through the events of the past 24 hours , hearing the panic in my own voice , trying to keep the volume low . Saying these things out loud I feel a wave of uncertainty run through me . Do I sound crazy ? <newline> <newline> `` Ma'am are you under the influence ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It sounds to me like you 've had a heavy night , a bad dream and you 're scaring yourself . Are the mist and the handprint still visible ? '' <newline> <newline> I glance over to the window . The mist of gone and the handprint is almost invisible in the light of the rising sun . Could I be imagining this ? <newline> <newline> `` Well barely , but- '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry ma'am but we have more important things to look into than one woman 's bad dream . If you have a concern worth reporting , feel free to call back . '' <newline> <newline> *click* . <newline> <newline> I stare at the phone in my shaking hand , now emitting a flat dialling tone . I replace it in the cradle , reminding myself to breathe , before picking it back up and dialling Dan again . <newline> <newline> He picks up after 15 rings , when I 'm starting to feel desperate . His voice is thick and heavy with sleep as he answers , an annoyed edge audible in his tone . <newline> <newline> I blurt out my fears , tripping over my words , desperate for someone to believe me , to help me . <newline> <newline> There 's a long pause before he answers , and when he does , his tone is laced with what I can only describe as gentle condescension . <newline> <newline> `` Annie did you take a sleeping pill last night ? You know they give you funny dreams sometime . Remember in your last place when you thought your neighbours were pumping sedating gas through the vents ? You were taking the tablets then and nothing ever came of that . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't answer for a few seconds . I trust Dan , he 's been one of my closest friends for years , and was the only one of my friends that stuck by me through that 'episode ' . I 'm still not convinced that my perception of events was n't the reality , but the restraining order my neighbours brought against me after I spent hours screaming through their letterbox begging them to stop poisoning me , suggests that at least from a legal standpoint , I was wrong . <newline> <newline> I still have n't figured out what was wrong with me while I lived there , I 've been fine ever since I was forced to leave . Dan suggested this place to me , his mother 's remote old house , thinking that having new neighbours might just lead me to have a new bout of paranoia , and so far , it 's worked fine . <newline> <newline> `` Dan , please listen to me . This is n't in my head ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Annie maybe you need to go back to the doctor . I know you do n't think you need medication and I know you 've been fine for a good long while , but it 's better to get to these things before they become a bigger problem . '' <newline> <newline> I stare at the phone in my hand , tears spilling over my lids , blurring my vision anew . I hear Dan 's tinny voice coming from the phone , telling me it 's probably best that I take a few days off , see a doctor and get myself settled . He does n't want to see me in work until I 'm feeling better . He does n't offer to come out and see me . I mumble something that could be construed as assent and place the phone gently back into the cradle . <newline> <newline> Feeling better ? What a joke . I down the glass of water on my bedside table , and curl into a ball , pulling the blankets over my head and sobbing until I fall asleep from exhaustion . <newline> <newline>

1,"Intelligence is everything nowadays , that 's why I am in this position . Come to think of it , what is this position ? I 'm in total darkness . Am I dead ? I 'll have to try and remember from the beginning . <newline> <newline> It must have been two years now , 2 years since I was taken . Why had I been taken ? Something to do with knowing too much . But what had I known ? I 've tried to remember so many times now . It 's hopeless . <newline> <newline> I remember being bundles into a white van on a dark , cold winter night . I could hear some dogs talking to each other in the way dogs do , the man that had grabbed me wore a green boiler suit and a balaclava . I felt a strange feeling inside . Fear ! there was no point getting worked up , that would n't have helped . Next thing I knew I was dragged into a tall , abandoned-looking castle with grey stone walls ; it could n't have been that old though , it looked as though it had been built in the last fifteen years . I remember how scared I was with my back scraping along the cobbled floor , my raw back was burning . <newline> <newline> I was shoved in to a room with a solid steel door , inside was a wooden table and three wooden chairs but no windows . After four days alone in that room I was starting to lose my mind until one day when two guards entered . <newline> `` Stand up and sit on the chair ! '' ordered one of the guards . <newline> i could n't be bothered with more pain so I just obeyed , I was acting like a well trained dog . <newline> `` How much do you know about Indigo 2000 ? '' Questioned the other guard . <newline> I said nothing . The guard who spoke first slapped me , my cheek immediately started throbbing . Still I did n't speak . The first guards face reddened with anger and he aimed a punch straight at my jaw , it connected . Weakly I fell to the floor . I was in so much pain but I was n't about to give in that easily . My whole face was aching , I felt like crying but I could n't give them the satisfaction . I tried my best to keep a straight face with my mouth clamped shut . I did know about Indigo 2000 , I knew it was a secret operation , I knew they could n't kill me because I was the final piece of the puzzle . I knew the Ministry of Defence like the back of my hand , if I did n't have some information that they needed they would have shut me up already . <newline> <newline> The guards man-handled me back to my seat . <newline> `` Tell us what you know and this will be much more , pleasant . '' <newline> I continued my silence . Together they dragged me to my feet and marched me to another room . This room also had a solid steel door but inside it was a little different , there were still no windows but this room contained only a mattress , a toilet and a bucket of water that was clearly for washing . They shoved me onto the mattress , quickly shuffled out of the room and shut the door . I heard the clicking of the lock and at that point knew that there was no escape ! I felt like screaming but what was the point . <newline> <newline> Days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months . Every day followed the same routine : Waking up early to a knock on the door and then the guard bringing in the first meal of the day which was bread and butter with a glass of water , I ate the bread and then sat waiting and thinking until another knock on the door which was the sign of another meal which was exactly the same and they collected my plate and glass from earlier . about an hour after delivering the second meal , the guards would collect the plate and glass again . <newline> <newline> After a couple of months the routine was broken . About midday the guards came in and ordered me to my feet before dragging me back to the previous interrogation room . Once again they asked what I knew , they were much tougher this time though . same as before , I held my silence , so once again they marched me back to my room . This was my chance , I was going to wait any longer . I set of at a sprint which caught the guards by surprise . I turned the first corner and nobody was there , I was going to get away . I turned the next corner and almost ran straight in to an armed guard , at this point the other two guards caught up . It was all over . Once again I was dragged along the cold floor and thrown back into my room . <newline> <newline> The next day we were back to the same routine that we had followed for the previous few months . It lasted for a year and half with the guards trying to break me nearly every day . They asked me if I was ready to tell them what I knew every day , the truth was that I no longer remembered , I did n't even remember my own name . They must have drugged my feet to stop me from thinking for myself but the only thing that it achieved was to make me forget . The one thing that I did still remember was that I needed to escape . <newline> <newline> One day I decided that I was going to try and attempt an escape , I could n't even remember if I had tried to escape before and if I had I definitely did n't know what had gone wrong . I started to plan , there were n't a lot of options available so it almost planned itself . I was going to smash my glass and then attack the guard when he came to collect it . When the time came it was a lot easier than I could have expected , the guard thought that I had given up and certainly did n't expect the attack . <newline> <newline> As I got out of my room I heard a voice , a male voice from the room next door it was shouting for help . I knew it was potentially dangerous to let him out but I needed all of the help I could get . How was I going to get him out of that room though ? What was that ? A glimpse of silver on the guards belt , a key . I snatched the key and tried it in the door , it worked . A man who must have only been in his twenties bust out of the door . He had dark brown hair and eyes as green as leaves . The main things that stood out were his bushy eyebrows and his overgrown beard . Overall he was very unkempt . <newline> `` Who are you ? '' He asked . <newline> `` I could ask the same of you . '' I replied . <newline> `` Oh , sorry . My name is Fred and I was taken by Lucas , I do n't know why though . '' explained Fred . <newline> `` So that 's who took me ? . I 'm john by the way , I 'm starting to remember why I was taken but I ca n't tell you . <newline> `` Let 's just get out of here ! '' Pleaded Fred . <newline> <newline> We ran for what felt like hours down endless corridors until we finally found the front entrance . The door was welcoming us with open arms . We barged through , fresh air . I had n't experienced this since I was captured , paradise . It did n't last for long . I was brought crashing back to reality by the 30 foot wall that stood in front of us . It was a stone wall and we were going to have to scale it . the climb up was horrendous , it was slightly easier on the way down but it was still awful . We only realised how stupid we were when we touched down to the floor , there was a welcome party consisting of five guards . A bang to the head and then darkness . <newline> <newline> So that was how I got here . <newline> <newline> Lay in total darkness , I 'm starting to consider what the future may hold and for the first time I have started to cry . i may die , I probably wo n't escape . I 'll just have to wait and see . <newline> <newline> What 's that ? A break in the darkness , some natural light , hands on my neck pulling me out . I was in a car boot all along , a green BMW with a private reg . I was thrown face first in to some sand which I had to spit out as I stood up . <newline> <newline> Standing in front of me was a tall , well-shaven man with Blonde hair , He was in a black suit . <newline> `` You must be Lucas ! '' I exclaimed . <newline> `` We finally meet . '' Lucas chuckled . <newline> `` What have you done with Fred ? '' I questioned . <newline> `` We had to dispose of him . '' he explained . <newline> I screamed . <newline> `` You 've caused me endless trouble and we need to end this . '' said Lucas . <newline> As he finished I was shoved in the back , the force knocked me straight into Lucas ' swinging fist . I managed to recover fairly quickly and landed a punch of my own . Lucas managed to swipe my legs and started to kick me as I lay on the floor . It almost turned into a wrestling match until we scrambled back to our feet . I managed to land an uppercut which shook him and then I punched him in the stomach , as he doubled over I brought up my knee to meet with his face . Lucas fell and I jumped straight on top hammering his face with my fists . I started to choke him , as the last bits of life started to slip away from him I was tackled from the side by one of the guards , this was never going to be a fair fight . Lucas still was n't moving , I was once again dragged back to my room . <newline> `` Why am I still alive ? '' I asked . <newline> `` I do n't know , Lucas has ordered us not to kill you . '' replied the guard . <newline> <newline> I must have been stupid to think I 'd get away . I thought I was free , now I 'm stuck in this room again and I have no idea what 's to come .

1,"( I originally wrote this trying to find something that goes along with [ this music . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4VBU4vqk8jA ) Took me a bit to figure out something that worked for me . ) <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> He could n't look back . It might make him stop walking . <newline> <newline> His shoes finally had given in . A few hundred steps ago , the sensation on his soles was different . Or was it a thousand steps ? By now , he was n't feeling it any longer . It did n't matter , just another piece of pain in his body . The only thing that mattered was to move on . To get to where he had to be . He was no longer looking at the skeletons at the side of the road or the somewhat fresher corpses . The smell no longer reached his nose , either , there was only ash . His hands were used to woodwork . He was good at what he had learnt , making many people happy with the things he made for them . <newline> <newline> Despite what little energy he had in his limbs , he looked at his hand . His fingers were stiff and black with the dust that had rubbed into them . They were as dry as his throat and his entire body . He stopped looking down . It would only add another chance of failure . If he stumbled , he would stay on the ground , giving up . He was avoiding stepping on bones . They had given up , but he could not hurt them for that . He wanted to rest and give up so badly . Was he the last one ? He was alone , it all was on him . <newline> <newline> Another car was in his way , but he was starting to like it . In the midst of all the pain , he felt something special . The soft touch of the layer of ash on his hands . A soft bed , he only had to lie down for a moment . Just sit down , all of them had done it as well . They wanted him to join in , they knew that he was suffering . Their empty eyes staring at him . <newline> <newline> Another step . He was past the car , past another . Avoiding to stop on the pieces of glass , for his soles were barely there . Everything felt strangely soft . Painful , but soft . The wound on his back had opened up , but the blood that was spilling was feeling good . He was not , he could not be afraid any longer . The pain was a sensation that was everywhere , but it was just that . A sensation , nothing else . He had the power that noone else had . That man or woman with a child in their arms . They were bones , dry bones . <newline> <newline> The man stood still for a moment . Every step of his path was his enemy . The ones who had given up were enemies , speaking their lies into his ears . He looked up into the sky , dark , ashen clouds spanning it down to the horizon . A croaking sound came from his throat , the muscles used for speaking so long without use . His eyes were hurting . He wanted to see the sky . He wanted to see ... <newline> <newline> A silent scream of pain on his lips , the man forced his gaze back . Demons were riding in his mind . Not god , not angels . They would not make him go further , force himself to take another step . Glass shards were cutting into his skin , severing the dry tissue in his feet . He moved again . Further , down the road . Past the skeletons , the cars . A bus with skeletons in each of the seats . His foot felt warmer than before , at least a bit . <newline> <newline> Was he happy ? Would he be happy if he got there ? He did not dare to look if the piece of paper was still there . What if his eyes failed ? What if he lost it ? He should just give up . It was not going to work . How could he , the demon-ridden being that he was , save anyone ? He was so weak , his body was weak . It was so long , too , to get to the place . So many , many more people who were all relaxing , sitting by the side of the road . They were laughing at him , too . Laughing at his shaky , old body . How his breath caused clouds of dust to appear before his mouth , the dust that had gathered in his beard . <newline> <newline> Maybe he should sit down for just a minute . Maybe just a second or two , to get his strength back . He put more of his weight on his hand as he steadied himself on a ash-coated taxi . Maybe he could try to open the door and take a nap on the seat . Just a small dream of a better world , then he would go back to this one . He promised himself with all his might that he would stand up again . To go on . Why was it not enough to sate the demons in his head ? He moved on . Each step drove the glass shards deeper , but the pain was just there . He was so tired , he was so cold . The hunger was there , too , but his stomach probably could not do its work any longer . Why was he still able to walk , anyway ? <newline> <newline> He probably was dead and just imagining all of this . There was no way it all happened , that it all could be up to him . And still , his shaking knee felt real . He was not falling . He wanted to give up , but he was not allowing it . His body was a machine that had rusted and was damaged , but he was keeping it going . Further and further , without fuel or repairs , towards that goal of theirs . He was not alone , he had himself . But his machine was giving up . One arm was hanging down loose . It was not going to work again , ever . The legs were working , muscles tightening up and protesting with every step . They were burning up themselves and anything to sate the being that was commanding this rusty , old machine . <newline> <newline> They arrived . The man was standing in front of a small building that looked as destroyed as every other building in the city or on the planet . The upper floors were gone . It was a house for a small family of four , maybe . The wooden floor had somehow survived the fires , but it was creaking as he stepped on it . It was not giving in , either , even if he was wishing it did . So close to his goal , and he still wanted to give up . There was a burnt couch . He was crying as he walked past it , towards the kitchen . The tiled floor was covered in the ash , his steps drawing some figures in the dark , a bit of red adding to the grey world . <newline> <newline> The door to the cellar opened easily enough , but he was terrified of the stairs . So close . He would not give up any longer , by now he could only fail by his own shortcomings . The first step down the stone stairs was the scariest step of his life . Such a simple thing and he knew that it could end all of the world right there . The next step was natural , the long-trained program in his brain coming up . The glass shards were driving deeper still , but he was not going to lose his balance . He was too close . He would be happy that he failed . He would be with everyone . He would not be alone . <newline> <newline> He made it to the end of the stairs . Another step , then another . The cellar was darker than the outside , but his eyes were used to the dark . He found the door , the thick metal stoically resisting the times . It would give in some day , too , but not just yet . Only one of his arms was still working , trying to push down the handle . Why was it so strong ? The door was stronger than he was . His weight pushed down on the handle , but he hardly had anything left over . The fight was a silent one , for the man had no more voice . It lasted a minute . Then two . Maybe he could sleep until the door gave up . <newline> <newline> There was no way for it . He was the messenger . He was the one who had not given up . If there was a wall of stone , he would walk through it . If there was a metal door , he would open it . It opened , almost making him fall over as it did . As it opened , the man tried to stand still in the doorframe , looking into the room . There were a few simple wooden chairs , only coated with a thin layer of dust , not ash . Then there were some pults with levers and buttons . The man stood still a bit longer . He was terrified . It was hurting him , but he moved his arm up , to the pouch in his coat . The piece of paper he produced was small , but it was there . He moved forward , another step . Towards the console . <newline> <newline> He was blinking . He should not have blinked . He had no more tears , no more water to clean his eyes . He was crying without tears , but he forced himself to look at the piece of paper . A number . <newline> <newline> His breath sped up . Excitement . He was sprinting towards the goal , sprinting towards what he desired so badly . That thing he desired more than anything his body could ever want . He dropped the piece of paper onto the console , entering the code on the buttons . That was what he had to do . That was all he had to do . <newline> <newline> His breath was raspy , he could taste the blood that was pouring down his throat through the dry , ripped up tissue . He was too fast . But nothing would matter much longer . A step to the side , but he could steady himself on the console . Then the last button . The last button he needed . Without any ceremony , he pushed it . <newline> <newline> Nothing happened .

1,"**No title yet . ** <newline> <newline> Been working on this for a while and getting nowhere . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> Hilt couldn ’ t believe that people actually lived like this , so confined and restricted . She ’ d arrived in the city barely an hour before and was still having trouble coming to terms with her surroundings . The journey itself had not been especially arduous once she got the hang of traveling by ship , there had been the initial few days of seasickness , but she eventually adjusted . Her horse , Full-Sprint , had a more miserable time however . At first he ’ d been excited by the constant supply of hay and various fruits and vegetables , but once the ship had cast off it was clear that he was not a horse that enjoyed being confined to such a small area for an extended period of time . <newline> <newline> The horse was a huge , white , fussy bastard of a thing who couldn ’ t stand anything slower than a run and kept trying to convince Hilt that she should let him . A horse that used to running freely across the land was never going to enjoy being kept below the deck of a dwarven fishing and transport ship . But it was the quickest way for them to reach Koryal Ruskal , so there was little choice in the matter . They could have been dropped off at the border between Hynyezemryae and Frár Andail , but the ride from the Dwarflands to the elven capital would have taken weeks by horse , and from what Hilt had learned , the mass migration that was taking place made the journey far too hazardous . So , instead of the days journey it would take them to travel to the Dwarven Divide , they instead opted for the two week journey along the warm summer currents directly to the Koryal Ruskal docks themselves . <newline> <newline> And so there Hilt walked , leading Full-Sprint through the noise and bustle of the fish market with the sea breeze at her back while she tried to regain her land legs . She was wearing a pair of hand-stitched leather shoes , a gift from her clan-brother Savi , given to her when she left the island along with several other gifts given to her by the rest of her clan as they ’ d said their goodbyes She hated footwear , finding the covering uncomfortable , but Savi had insisted she would need them . Looking at the muddy road that lay ahead of her farther into the city , Hilt began to understand why . <newline> <newline> The sheer amount of noise on the docks was almost offensive to her , having grown up more accustomed to the silence and isolation of island life , to the point where she felt the amount of people and noise around her was almost draining her of energy . The number of people turning to look and stare at her as she passed was hardly surprising . In fact , she had been told to expect it . Apparently an orc that wasn ’ t a sellsword was a rare sight , a blonde orc even more so , to the point where after a moment Hilt was forced to stop and pull her hood over her head . She ’ d been cautioned not to draw too much attention to herself , but that was easier said than done . Regardless , she had a job to do , for the Sarramitbar brothers and for herself . Finding what the dwarf brothers were looking for would be the easiest to do , as she knew where to start and it would likely help her start to find her own way . With that in mind , Hilt set out looking for the nearest stable . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> The stench of civilization filled Kavec ’ s senses as he neared the city gates . It was unmistakable to those who knew it and to those who didn ’ t , they could be forgiven for mistaking the smell with that of an animal pen . It was largely due to the amount of waste in the outer districts , but behind that there was the smell of smoke . Of cooking food , burning wood and smelting . In fact , Kavec had thought to himself on numerous occasions that the only difference between the lower districts and a cattle yard was the fire . <newline> <newline> He was barely a mile from the main gate with the damned setting sun shining in his eyes , but the stench was still strong , owed largely to the fact that the easterly ocean breeze coming in off the coast was blowing it straight towards him . He wouldn ’ t have been surprised if that was an intentional feature agreed upon by the more central upper districts with the blessing of the royal court so that they neither would have to deal with presence of the lower districts any more than they already had to . <newline> <newline> Nevertheless , he was home , for all the good that did him . He tried to avoid the capital as much as possible , opting to work further inland where he transported goods between the local farms that had set themselves up along the east river , but the recent drought had forced him and others back here . The weather was infamously erratic during these years , with winter , spring and even summer lasting months longer than anyone anticipated , to the point that winter would suddenly strike mid-year while summer sometimes wouldn ’ t come until years end . It would be several more years before the seasons righted themselves again , or at least as close to righted as they could get . Typically the more stubborn farmers would stay behind , since most of them came from families that had been working the land for several generations and knew the tricks they needed to keep their crops healthy and livestock fed . Everyone else tended to relocate to the coastal cities though , where the rivers weren ’ t as dry and the ocean traders took full advantage of the influx of inlanders . <newline> <newline> The next few years would be especially hard however . There were more inlanders making their way to the Elfland capital of Koryal Ruskal this year than any previously . The lower districts were cramped enough to begin with and already Kavec could already see the effects of the inlander migration . Tents and makeshift homes were hastily built around the exterior of the city walls , making Kavec glad that he had organized accommodation months ago . He ’ d only been young during the last Long Seasons and had n't had to work through the hardships they presented , but he ’ d organized an arrangement with an old acquaintance for work down on the docks , moving the hauls from the ships to the upper and lower district markets . The fact that he was even considered for the job was helped in no small part by the fact that he owned his own cart and horse , which he suddenly found himself grateful for considering he ’ d likely need to expand his route to the outer wall , especially if the outliers had set up their own stalls . <newline> <newline> The city gates were wide open as he approached , which was hardly surprising . Only a fool would try to attack the capital with anything less than half the peoples of a neighboring continent . And even then , no one was brave enough to attempt something so suicidal , not after the resolution of the Orc Uprisings more than a century before . Even now as he approached the gates , Kavec could see a few orcs here and there , likely sellswords hired to guard some of the families and caravans that had made their way to the capital . The Long Seasons were notorious for the increase in highwaymen skulking along the roads , aiming to rob some of the less guarded caravans . Regardless , the orcs tended to stay on their own , never in more than groups of two or three . They didn ’ t want to be confused as conspirators against the crown . Of course , all that would change when they made their way back inland once their services were no longer required . It was much more difficult to police the barbarian tribes than the outer city walls , not to mention that a few opportunistic greenskins would likely try to band together to rob any of the late-comers in an attempt to make some extra coin . That was orcs in a nutshell ; paid bodyguards to one caravan , cursed highwaymen to another . <newline> <newline> Kavec wrinkled his nose as he approached the gate . Sometimes he didn ’ t know what smelled worse , the city or the orcs . At least lower district slummers seemed to bathe . The orcs almost always reeked of months-old body odor with greasy , tangled black hair , usually worked into dreadlocks that were tied back with an old strip of leather and scraggly , close cut facial hair that typically looked like it was cut with a dull dagger , which it probably was . Kavec could barely tolerate green swine on a good day , and he certainly wasn ’ t in any sort of good mood at the moment , not with the sun still in his eyes . <newline> A guard waved him through the gate without even bothering to shake him down for goods and coin , not out of laziness but out of recognition . There was only one family in Koryal Ruskal that owned horses with the brand his carried . Cutter , his horse , was not unique . He was a sturdy beast with light brown colouring across its body , mane and tail with white , feathered hooves , but he was Kavec ’ s horse nevertheless and the closest thing Kavec had to a friend when he was on the road . <newline> <newline> Cutter handled himself well as he pulled Kavec and his cart through the city gates apart from the occasional snort , which Kavec could hardly blame him for . The stench of discarded scrap and dumped waste was almost overwhelming now that they were within the city walls and the increased traffic had turned the roads to mud , which was made all the more disturbing when you stopped and considered how long it had been since it had rained . Past the gates however there were less orcs and more people . He spotted a few dwarves , typically working the stalls or peddling other wares and at one point he thought he caught sight of an elf , but given how far they were from the upper districts it was more likely a halfer . <newline> <newline> Making his way to the stables , Kavec closed his eyes and took in the sights and sounds of the city and found himself reminded of why he rarely came back here . <newline>

1,"The Lazarus Report <newline> *** <newline> **Progress report 1 : ** <newline> <newline> Submitted the designs and budget requirements for the librarian robot , Lazarus , to Mizzix of the Izmagnus . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 2 : ** <newline> Proposal rejected . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 37 : ** <newline> <newline> Submitted the designs and budget requirements for the librarian robot , Lazarus , to Mizzix of the Izmagnus . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 38 : ** <newline> <newline> The Lazarus project has finally received approval ! Work to begin tomorrow . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 38 ( addendum ) : ** <newline> <newline> How does Mizzix expect me to work with this budget ? ! This is barely enough money for a prototype , let alone the iterative development I discussed in my proposal ! <newline> <newline> **Progress report 42 : ** <newline> <newline> The blueprints and preliminary design are coming along dreadfully , I ’ ve had to cut back many of the features that were not core to Lazarus ’ s intent . I figure I ’ ll need to sift through a scrap pile or three before this project is complete . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 47 : ** <newline> <newline> I have been contacting some of my old friends in the other guilds to see if I can get my hands on any salvageable parts . Hammal in the Boros legion said he ’ d check their evidence locker for old parts . Maybe I can get my hands on some old constructs or at least some gears . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 55 : ** <newline> <newline> Spent a portion of the budget on prototyping hands . Lazarus will need fine motor control to handle books and other items to be stored and cataloged in the library , so this warrants the expense . Most of my calculations seem sound , but I can ’ t risk the hands failing at a critical juncture . Prototypes to be constructed in cheaper lesser metals . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 70 : ** <newline> <newline> Further tests indicate that an optimal form of the hands requires mizzium clockwork . Hand model must be redesigned to house gears and counterbalances in the forearm . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 73 : ** <newline> <newline> Hammal told me he found the chassis of an old construct that wasn ’ t needed as evidence any longer . He apologized profusely but said it was the only thing he could spare . The package should arrive tomorrow . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 74 : ** <newline> <newline> Apparently the chassis came from a Rakdos pleasure house . The less I think about what this was used for the better . It ’ s not mizzium , but at least it ’ s durable . The chassis also came with a head piece . Not sure if that ’ s an upside or a downside at this point considering the eyes were gouged out . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 93 : ** <newline> <newline> Lazarus is coming along passably . I was able to convince Crizilzix down the hall to give me some old lenses from one of his submersible Zonot explorers . I ’ ll need to find some way to correct the focus so Lazarus is actually able to see above water , but it ’ s a start . Designs for the endoskeleton have been revamped to account for the extra weight on the hands . Hands are complete and functioning properly . Component stress testing indicates a mean time to failure of 350 years . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 104 : ** <newline> <newline> I have completed the endoskeletal design . Crizilzix suggested adding extra compartments in the legs . Having secure compartments built into Lazarus will ensure the safety of the more delicate devices that Lazarus will be handling . Crizilzix might not be directly involved in the project , but he became interested in seeing how I was going to use his parts . The order is placed . Parts to arrive within the next three to five days . I have to focus on other things within my control . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 105 : ** <newline> <newline> By Niv-Mizzet that was close ! While rechecking my notes I found an error in my calculations . Fortunately I was able to correct the order before smelting began . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 125 : ** <newline> <newline> Lazarus has been assembled fully . The hands are in place and the chassis was attached without too much trouble . Crizilzix keeps teasing me about how I ’ m making a “ pleasure bot. ” The head and lens are working properly based on the tests , still out of focus , but functional . The endoskeleton is exposed along the back and upper arm , as well as along the neck and hips . However , the endoskeleton is almost entirely mizzium so this should not prove problematic . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 126 : ** <newline> <newline> Crizilzix will not stop complaining that the head is unsettling without hair so I left the lab , went to the Tin Street Market , and bought the first cheap wig I could find . Now Crizilzix is saying I have a “ thing ” for blue haired women . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 131 : ** <newline> <newline> I have managed to obtain some glasses for Lazarus . The lenses are now calibrated for an above water environment . Crizilzix comments that she wouldn ’ t be a proper librarian without glasses . Our final hurdles include finding an appropriate mana battery and getting a mind loaded into Lazarus . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 142 : ** <newline> <newline> I was able to get my hands on an old rechargeable mana battery . The output is higher than strictly necessary , but it should be fine . In addition it should be able to keep Lazarus running as long as it stays in proximity to sources of excess mana such as the blistercoils and steam vents . Now I need to compile the data core to get Lazarus running . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 150 : ** <newline> <newline> Lazarus keeps malfunctioning with the data cores I produce . I can ’ t seem to get Lazarus to recognize and sort any of the information I provide . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 157 : ** <newline> <newline> Still no luck . I can get Lazarus to perform sorting tasks , but the language recognition is not working at all . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 162 : ** <newline> <newline> None of the algorithms I ’ ve implemented can properly read the chicken scratch of the other chemisters . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 166 : ** <newline> <newline> At this rate I ’ m going to have nothing to show despite all the time and effort I put into this . I know this can work . I want to show the other chemisters , the researchers , Niv-Mizzet himself ! I want to show them something they ’ ve never seen before , to make the world bigger than it was before . Lazarus stares back at me . That name isn ’ t really appropriate for the robot at this point considering how female it turned out . But it 's got blue hair . Blue - > Lapis Lazuli - > Lapis - > Lazarus . <newline> <newline> [ Close enough . ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/B4222 ) <newline> <newline> **Progress report 169 : ** <newline> <newline> I visited bane alley today . I was able to track down a back alley trader , probably a Dimir , who will sell me a core with proper language recognition . He explained that he would import memories to the data core so that Lazarus can use natural language processing . It ’ s probably not the best solution , but it ’ s something . <newline> <newline> **Progress report 170 : ** <newline> <newline> The core arrived . I have no budget . No time . This has to work . Calibration and instillation to run overnight . <newline> *** <newline> <newline> **Incident report number 315578 , filed by Wojec officer Hammal : ** <newline> Loss of one Izzet contsruct ( Lazarus ) belonging to Chemister Frixel . Construct was composed primarily of valuable mizzium alloy with intent to file reports for other chemisters in the Izzet League . <newline> <newline> Chemister Frixel arrived in his lab early today to check on his project , only to find it missing . The lab was locked with no signs of forced entry . Despite the disarray of the lab , Chemister Frixel insists that the only item missing is the construct itself . <newline> <newline> Work was nearly completed despite many setbacks and cut corners due to a lack of budget . This resulted in the use of many substandard parts , thus it does not seem to have any material value to a thief . Frixel believes one of the other chemisters is attempting to sabotage his project by stealing it . <newline> <newline> I will not rule out the possibility that Frixel is hiding the machine in order to delay his presentation of it , but his state of desperation make that seem unlikely . <newline> <newline> Requesting a warrant from the Azorius senate to search specific laboratories ( see attached document ) of the Izzet Guild hall on behalf of Chemister Frixel . <newline> *** <newline> **Lazarus report 0000 : ** <newline> <newline> [ [ Booting primary core… ] ] <newline> <newline> [ [ Loading personality settings… ] ] <newline> <newline> We .

1,"5 AM ( Alarm Clock ) <newline> <newline> `` So you know about dating older men right ? '' <newline> Her young 24 year old Zoe asked . <newline> At 45 Stephanie had worked hard to be were she 's at in life and everything has changed drastically in the last year and a half . <newline> `` Well yeah ... I mean I guess why ? '' She asked Zoe nervously , had she been found out that she and her married boss had been having an affair . <newline> <newline> `` Well it 's just that Tomorrow is his birthday and I would really like to get him something special '' Zoe looked at her with hopeful eyes . <newline> `` What 's he like ? '' <newline> Zoe started naming him off enthusiastic . <newline> Stephanie envied her and how much passion her new boy friend seemed to have . <newline> Over the months Stephanie watched jealously as her assistant revived flowers , teddy bears and love letters at work . While Zoe 's relationship was blossoming Stephanie 's was becoming toxic and hateful . <newline> The loneliness of being some ones secrets were taking its toll . No longer was the excitement of elicit love a high . The only thing that gave her hope was listening to Zoe and how amazing her new boyfriend And Zoe hoped future husband . <newline> <newline> the only constant in her terbulant life was her wind up alarm clock set to go off at 5 AM . It gave her ample time go through her morning routine . <newline> <newline> Today she woke up at five AM with a hopeful feeling . It was her birthday . Zoe was more chipper than usual but Steph was too busy today she wanted to get off early and get ready for a night on the town . <newline> <newline> She put on her make up putting on the dress and perfume he purchased for her . 6 PM nothing , 7 PM nothing , 8PM <newline> Her phone beeps she looks at the message . <newline> `` Sorry gorgeous but I ca n't make it , my wife is ... '' <newline> She closes the message not caring to finish reading it . <newline> <newline> She had been here every year for over 25 years at this exact Italian restaurant something drew her here but she was n't sure why . <newline> <newline> She sat herself at a table by the bar when a quick flash of red hair caught her eye . She heard the uplifting smile of Zoe . Steph figured she could use an her company tell her about her and Brett 's affair she was tired of being some ones secret but was she turned the corner the sight was like splash of cold water . <newline> <newline> She saw him on one knee Micheal her ex husband looking at Zoe who was dressed in a beautiful red dress . <newline> She heard his voice `` Zoe , I thought I 'd never be happy again but that was until I met you . Please marry me . '' <newline> Tears flow d from his and her face as the crowed cheered them on Steph ran away . How could she be so dumb and naive ! ? ! <newline> Micheal , her ex husband . Her dull ex husband who she lost interest in who had no passion . Who was never as spontaneous as Brett ( her boss ) who was pure lust who made her feel like a woman not a wife or mother . <newline> <newline> She left the restaurant enraged and found her way back to her apartment . One glass of wine turned into a bottle and a bottle into two . She started remembering all the advice she 's given Zoe all the happy stories about her boyfriend , my Micheal ! <newline> <newline> How stupid could she be the two years of searching for a new fulfillment her affair with Brett and the few hook ups with younger men never left her feeling happy and now hearing her ex husband was remarrying now happy and in love she was over the edge . <newline> She found her stash of pills and swallowed two , three..eight . The bottle of vodka she could barely hold as she face planted into bed . <newline> ( ring ! ) ( ring ! ) ( ring ! ) <newline> She woke up looking around frantically , who set the alarm ? ! ? <newline> Before she could get the answer Micheal walked in <newline> `` Happy birthday , my queen ! '' He handed her a cup of coffee . <newline> `` Figure I try and wake up before you ! '' He leaned in giving her a loving kiss . The kids made you this . He handed her a clay ash tray . <newline> Steph , looked around she looked around and held the crudely made ash tray . She had tears of joy , it was a gift her kids had made her it had been months since she had seen them . From the fall out of the divorce to the resentment they held over her , she was glad to even get a card on mothers day from them . <newline> `` I 'll tell them you loved it '' Micheal , saw her tears and was glad she loved it ... .even if it was just a clay ash tray even though she did n't smoke . <newline> <newline> She called her manager and decided to take the day off , she was still confused as to what was going on . <newline> As she made her way around her marital home she was in tears seeing her old family pictures of herself with Micheal and her kids hanging on the walls . <newline> `` I 'm taking the day off today . '' She told Micheal . <newline> He had a face of awe , she never took days off . `` Great ! '' he thought for a moment . <newline> Her and Micheal spent the day together as they sat lounging around the house holding , she rested her head on his shoulder and he held her tighter . <newline> During their seperation leading up to their divorce , all the one night stands with younger men and her affair had never felt so fulfilled . <newline> <newline> `` I have to run a few errands but i 'll me you at the restaurant '' he gave her a kiss on the cheek before she could answer . <newline> She walked around their home looking at their wedding pictures , pictures of her on her maternity bed holding their twins , what had she given up ... .god please do n't let this be a dream . <newline> <newline> Later that night she was dressed to the nines at the same restaurant where she had seen Micheal and Zoe or a tleast thought she saw them . <newline> Over a glass of wine Micheal began speaking . <newline> `` I figure we could take a trip to Williamsburg , and take a colonial tour . '' She saw how nervous he was his hand trembling in his pocket . <newline> all she could say was `` okay '' <newline> `` Then , we could drop off the kids at my parents and we could drive down the coast and just have a romantic vacation you and I ? '' <newline> Tears filled her eyes , `` I 'd love that '' <newline> She remembered this exact conversation a few years back , when he suggested it she coldly said it sounded boring and she saw the hurt in his eyes and he became quiet the rest of the night . She figured the colder she was towards him the easier it would be to detach and leave him . She also remembered how Zoe , came back after a weeks vacation speaking of how beautiful Williams burg was and brought her some hand made candy . <newline> Before they left the restaurant she went to wash up in the bathroom . She saw a message on her phone . <newline> `` Hey , Beautiful . My secretary bailed on me and I wonder if you 'd like to accompany me to Boston next week for a business meeting. '' -Brett . <newline> Had this been the begining of the end two years ago , she quickly replied `` Please do n't call me beautiful only my husband can . I ca n't accompany you , lets keep it professional . '' <newline> `` Understood , sorry '' - Brett . <newline> When she exited the bathroom she found Micheal looking at her lovingly . He stood up before she reached her chair and kneeled pulling a ring from her pocket . <newline> `` Stephanie , on our first date it was your birthday and being a broke college student I gave you that dumb clock ... .but 25 years later you 've make me more and more happier . I love you . '' He placed the ring on one of her fingers . She remembered how after she dismissed his idea of a vacation as dumb and she became cold he removed his hand from his pocket . <newline> She felt like an evil bitch he just wanted to show her how much he loved her . <newline> <newline> As they got ready for bed , she stepped on a couple of legos , the memmory of the pain came back . She walked around the house angerly packing her bags as her twin boys begged her not to leave . Her husband was in tears begging her to say , as he calmed both her 9 year olds . <newline> As Micheal laid in bed , she exited the bathroom wearing lingerie she had forgotten she even owned . That night she made love with her husband and as he laid their sleeping she did n't want to close her eyes . She never wanted this day to end , she fell asleep from exhaustion holding his hand tightly . <newline> <newline> ( ring ! ) ( ring ! ) ( ring ! ) ( ring ! ) <newline> The old metallic clock went off , she had her eyes shut tightly . She could n't feel Micheal 's hand maybe he 'll arrive any moment with a cup of coffee . <newline> But for now she would keep her eyes closed , she did n't want to open her eyes and be filled with dread if she found herself in her lonely apartment . Or be filled with joy , if she was back at home with her loving husband and kids . For now she 'll let her 5 AM alarm ring and ring and ring ... .. <newline> <newline> Written on Iphone , wanted a story about infidelity and 2nd chances ( where a man was n't the cheater..so cliche ) but with a an open ending ... might be a rant .

1,"`` Morsta was founded by Emperor James I after he conquered ... '' <newline> - The history of Morsta <newline> <newline> It was only noon when Shawn came to the isles . <newline> <newline> The sun stood brightly , welcoming new any visitors to its white sand beaches , and palm trees that barely managed to block it 's view . <newline> <newline> With Shawn was a small group , three people all seeming unfit , and unready for what they planned to do this evening . <newline> <newline> While usually the elder of this group would be leading at this moment the teenager Shawn led the group across the beach , at most times this would silly or even unthinkable today was different . <newline> <newline> The foursome marched up across a hill covered in armor , their ensigns glowing in white sunlight and their hands kept on their weapons even when there seemed to be no danger . <newline> <newline> On top of the hill was the old crow , a crow so old no one knew if her charcoal skin was natural or if she had been in a sun to long . <newline> <newline> Each man bowed in respect and she overlooked them each with a glare , tapping her wrinkled finger on each man examining them . <newline> <newline> She coughed a clear fluid and began to speak ; `` Which one of you is the boy ? '' <newline> <newline> Shawn did n't move but the oldest and largest of the group pushed him forward <newline> <newline> `` Hello we hav- '' <newline> <newline> The crow shushed him and glared <newline> <newline> `` Do not speak , listen `` <newline> <newline> She put her attention on Shawn and stared at his chest , suddenly Shawn felt heart begin to burn <newline> <newline> `` Boy , you have came to me and have dared polluted my isles with these , these Gom Yabbers . '' <newline> <newline> Shawn of course wondered what a Gom Yabber is but dared not speak . <newline> <newline> `` If I did not have so much faith in you , you would be dead right now . Do you understand ? '' <newline> <newline> Shawn nodded his head and shook with fear wondering where she was going with this . <newline> <newline> `` You three , I 'll allow to stay on your boat off my isle I wish to be alone with the boy . '' <newline> <newline> One of the soldiers began to argue but soon after the crow raised her hands he began to walk away while still arguing . <newline> <newline> `` I am Glory , Glory ! I could hear you calling me a crow from the shores , but clearly you are n't here for me if your showing such disrespect , it 's my daughter you want . '' <newline> <newline> Shawn looked up and saw the angered face of Glory , although he had never seen her happy either <newline> <newline> `` Well I have came for Angel , but I did n't mean to anger you . '' Shawn said <newline> <newline> `` Do not worry all humans anger me , I 'm surprised Angel told you where to find her , if I was her I would of just came over there killed myself . '' Glory said <newline> <newline> `` I do n't think she 's planning to do that , I uh came to find my future . '' Shawn insisted <newline> <newline> `` Ha what is with mortals and caring about your 'future ' you 'll all be dead anyway . '' Glory said <newline> <newline> `` My general insisted , if I get- '' <newline> <newline> Glory cut him off and laughed <newline> <newline> `` War ! That 's what this about ? You silly humans what are you fighting about this time ? '' Glory chuckles <newline> <newline> `` Well the Imperial league is trying to unit- '' <newline> <newline> Once again he was cut off <newline> <newline> `` Boring politics I do n't care about it , although if my daughter wishes to help you then I hope you learn from your battles . '' Her voice softened this time and she smiled <newline> <newline> Glory waved for Shawn to follow her to a damp cavern , water came from the top of the roof , and small animals crawled on the floor . <newline> <newline> They walked across in the darkness following a distant , faint light that glory claimed was brighter then the sun itself . <newline> <newline> They walked until the reached the light source a large pool in a middle of a room , it glowed blue and Glory stared at Shawn one last time . <newline> <newline> She made her wrinkly black finger grow almost a foot longer and told Shawn to open his mouth , he refused and she began to yell . <newline> <newline> `` Open ! '' <newline> <newline> His mouth opened and she put the finger down his throat and grew it until it was in his lungs , suddenly his chest blew out and his eyes roll back . <newline> <newline> `` Breath ! '' Glory yelled <newline> <newline> Then his eyes rolled back and his lung filled with air , Glory pushed him into the pool and he fell until he saw her . <newline> <newline> Her being Angel . <newline> <newline> Angel resembled a young women in her 20 's , her hair was black and her skin was pale , somehow she looked like her mother but with a certain beauty to her . <newline> <newline> Her most notable feature was her eyes , they were a light flowing blue with no white to her eyes , just blue orbs stating at you immediately gaining your attention . <newline> <newline> `` Shawn ! You came . . `` <newline> <newline> Shawn floated up to her in the water and began to bow . <newline> <newline> Angel hugged Shawn and laughed . <newline> <newline> `` Save your bows , how was your trip ? You look as happy as when I first met you . '' <newline> <newline> `` It went well , and I 'm happy to see you . Everyone wanted to see but they were left at the coast . '' Shawn said <newline> <newline> Angel smiled <newline> <newline> `` Honestly I did n't wish to see them , they only care of war . '' <newline> <newline> So that must be the Glory speaking , Shawn thought . <newline> <newline> `` Come , follow me I have something to show you . '' She said <newline> <newline> Angel grabbed Shawn 's hand and led him across the ocean floor , walking hand in hand sometimes Shawn would start floating but Angel would pull him back . <newline> <newline> The two of them made it to a rock , large a grey rock on one side and a side covered in blue rock . <newline> <newline> Although Shawn noticed something more familiar , his ship . It was right above them . <newline> <newline> `` Shawn . is n't the sea beautiful ? '' Angel muses <newline> <newline> It was beautiful , calm and peaceful Shawn thought <newline> <newline> `` Your friends , they 've never seen beyond here . Beauty is alien to them . '' She mused once more <newline> <newline> `` Angel ... '' <newline> <newline> Angel grabbed the blue rocks and connected them , turning them into two necklaces . <newline> <newline> `` Sapphire , the diamonds of the sea wear this . '' Angel said <newline> <newline> `` Speaking of diamonds , my friends have seen there beauty . '' Shawn says while putting it on <newline> <newline> `` And they have seen me , but they do n't understand what they are seeing . '' Angel said <newline> <newline> `` I do n't understand either at times . '' Shawn said <newline> <newline> `` Yes , but I know you can Shawn. `` <newline> <newline> `` How ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Shawn I seen your future ; and I see your friends . '' <newline> <newline> `` And what happens in our future ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The future is rarely stagnant , but what I have seen troubles me . I see your death just another causality in a mortal conflict , and your friends do n't fare much better . '' <newline> <newline> Shawn takes a moment to think , his mind racing with many thoughts . <newline> <newline> `` You said it was n't stagnant , did you see anything else ? '' Shawn said <newline> <newline> `` Only little things , but I see a possibility . '' Angel said <newline> <newline> `` And what is that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I could make you immortal . '' Angel said while smiling <newline> <newline> `` Could you really ? '' Shawn said <newline> <newline> `` Yes ! You could live down here with me ; avoid the war live in paradise ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh Angel I ca n't do that . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why not ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I have friends , family I have a life above the sea . '' <newline> <newline> `` Better friends then me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I did n't say that . '' <newline> <newline> `` You implied it Shawn '' <newline> <newline> `` Shawn do not risk your life for them . '' <newline> <newline> Shawn was silent <newline> <newline> `` If you really feel so dearly about your companions then you may go , but do not claim I did n't warn you . '' <newline> <newline> And like that Shawn was forced high in into the sky flying up into the air till he could n't see Angel anymore . <newline> <newline> He fell into his ship cold and covered in water , his crew looking at him in surprise . <newline> <newline> They help him up and try to clean him off , amazingly Shawn 's necklace stayed on during the flight . <newline> <newline> There is silent until his elder , his general speaks up . <newline> <newline> `` So Shawn , what did she say about us are the odds good ? '' <newline> <newline> Shawn looks up at his general and looks him in the eye . <newline> <newline> `` She says the Imperial League will cover all of Verano . '' <newline> <newline> The men cheer as if they had already won , happy as can be . <newline> <newline> `` I knew it ! With the look you had on your face I almost thought you got bad news . Come on lad we must tell the Emperor . '' <newline> <newline> The four men began to row back home , three looking in the direction of their home and one looking back at the isle . <newline> <newline> Looking back at him was Glory shaking her head before going back into home . <newline>

1,"This is my first post here , and the first story I ’ ve actually finished in a long time ! I hope you all enjoy : ) <newline> <newline> … <newline> <newline> <newline> When I went away to Cliffsburg State , I was 20 years old , fresh out of community college , and I was an outsider . Had I played a game of “ Never Have I Ever ” with a group of any given C-State kids , I ’ d definitely have the most fingers remaining . I never sucked any football player ’ s dick . I never hooked up with anybody whose name I didn ’ t know . I never smoked any of the shitty Westminster weed in some shitty classmate ’ s shitty basement . I never snorted coke ; I never even saw the stuff in person . And I sure as shit never butt-chugged Everclear over a fancy marble toilet . <newline> <newline> <newline> That all changed on September 6th . Rush week was in full swing , and my roommate informed me that her friend from high school , a member of Nu Omicron Tau , wanted us to go to a patriotic-themed mixer . Upon hearing this , my reaction was mixed . “ Shit , I left my American flag tie-dye shirt at home ! ” “ I ’ ve never gone out before ; I wonder what it ’ s gon na be like. ” “ What if I wake up in some rando ’ s bed with a raging hangover and a crusty pair of boxers draped across my thigh ? ” “ Even if I do , it ’ ll be sooooo worth it. ” “ Are you sure , self ? Are you absolutely , positively , 100 % sure ? ” <newline> <newline> <newline> I ultimately agreed to go , under one condition- that I don ’ t leave my roommate ’ s sight , and vice versa . My roommate frequented Friday night basement parties back in high school , all of which were rife with drugs , alcohol , and smart teenagers making stupid decisions . She was well-versed enough to serve as my guide , to yank me away from persistent douchebags , and to hold my hair back if I felt like I was about to puke . <newline> <newline> <newline> We arrived at the party around 10:30 , and we were immediately greeted by a baker ’ s dozen of tipsy yet cordial sorority girls . I didn ’ t know them ; neither did my roommate , but we started talking and talking as if we had not seen each other in ten years . My roommate , who had never even left the Eastern Time Zone , handed me a Bud Light tallboy that she purchased with her Arizona ID . I took a sip of the beer and felt myself gagging . “ It ’ s literally just water , ” said my roommate . I took another sip . Expired white grape juice . Another sip , water . Each subsequent sip tasted less and less like beer and more and more like absolutely nothing at all . <newline> <newline> <newline> Then the frat guys and pledges started showing up . At that point , my beer was half-finished without me even realizing it . I ditched the can for a red cup ; I wanted to have the quintessential college party experience . I was definitely feeling the effects of the shitty domestic beer . The long-dormant blithe yet bad-decision-making side of me came out in full swing . Whenever the next song on the playlist booming throughout the house was a generic trap song , my hands were firmly planted against the wall and my body was in a half-assed squat position . I shook my ass and gyrated my hips , and that alone counted as my exercise for the day . <newline> <newline> <newline> I was getting really into my dancing ( if you could even call it that ) , the music , and the atmosphere . Everybody was in a good mood ; the main reason why they were all there was to have a good time . Positive energy permeated the main floor of the house all the way down to the basement . Until he came along . He saw me moving my body in ways he had never seen any girl do before . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ You can fuckin ’ dance , ” he said as he inched closer to me . “ Yeah , you can fuckin ’ dance , girl. ” He was now in my personal space . My roommate , who was just about a foot away , was trying to make conversation with one of the sorority girls over the booms of the bass and beats . She had her eye on this guy . She saw him get close enough to put his hands on me . I was just like , kinda feelin ’ it , so I let him do his thing . <newline> <newline> <newline> His hands eventually found their way to my ass . His fingers were just as awkward and lanky as he was , and he tried to get as much booty in the hand as he could . I tried moving his hands away , but he only squeezed tighter . I didn ’ t know what to do ; he just wouldn ’ t fucking give up . I had never let a guy treat me like this . I didn ’ t even know anything about him- his name , his age , his hometown , absolutely nothing . I never spoke to him before this . He was a complete and total stranger . <newline> <newline> <newline> Then the stranger leaned in close to me and started butting his lips against mine . Again , I didn ’ t know what to do . This was the first time somebody just had at it and started making out with me out of nowhere . Keep going or pull away ? Use tongue or not ? Think with your alcohol-flooded mind , dammit ! <newline> <newline> <newline> Our lips were together for what felt like the length of a paid programming infomercial , but in reality , it was more like the length of a GEICO ad . Either way , it was by far the worst kiss I ’ ve ever had , and I couldn ’ t wait until he ’ d take the hint that I wanted it to end . When it finally ended , I ran to the security of my roommate , who extended her arm for me to grab . She tried to intervene a few times , but this fucking guy kept getting in the way . He found me again and made me give him my number . Then my roommate and I pushed and shoved our way down the hall , desperate to get out . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Come back to my place ! ” slurred the guy as my roommate and I made our way down the steps of the house . She stood by my side and held my arm as I tried not to stumble and fall . We finally got out of the house , and the temperature difference between outside and the house was very noticeable . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ You were really into that , huh ? ” asked my roommate . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ At first , yeah , ” I replied , regret peppering my tone . “ But he got really touchy and didn ’ t want me to leave . He tried inviting us over to his apartment and shit. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Ew , yeah , I ’ m glad we left when we did , ” said my roommate as we walked down the street , trying to get as far away from the house as possible . “ And get this- while he was grinding on you , he was also giving me sex eyes . Like , make up your mind , fuckin ’ weirdo. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> I was beginning to sober up a little , and I was now making a little more sense of the situation . “ He could have done something terrible . But he didn ’ t , because you got me and sprinted the fuck out of there with me . I can ’ t thank you enough for that. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> “ No problem , ” my roommate replied . “ Are you doing okay ? ” <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , ” I said as I slowed my pace . “ I ’ m just thinking about how I dodged a real serious bullet there . I know this is the sketchiest part of town , but I feel so safe now ‘ cause he ’ s nowhere near me. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> My roommate and I continued to walk down the street until we reached a crosswalk . The lack of functioning crossing lights meant that we had to make value judgments and pray that we didn ’ t get hit by a car , but we made it in one piece and found a 24-hour greasy spoon further down the street . It was a place that , during the day , I would have disgustingly looked away from , but at night , it ’ s a refuge . <newline> <newline> <newline> We entered the restaurant and got seated at a booth . We didn ’ t even need menus because we both knew what we wanted- waffle fries and a milkshake , quintessential slightly-drunk food . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Despite… what happened , I had a lot of fun , ” I said out of nowhere . “ I never really got out much in high school , and this was just a great experience. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , you ’ re welcome . If you ever wan na do this again , let me know , ” my roommate said as she played with a packet of sugar . “ And if any weirdos try coming onto you… let me know and I ’ ll get rid of them. ” <newline> <newline>

1,"The cold deck hummed beneath Dina ’ s feet as she stepped from the cryo-pod . Stimulants were already lifting the haze from suspension and she made her way out of the stasis bay . She glanced back over her shoulder at the rows of sleepers , each waiting until the ship ’ s computers woke them for their rotations . The itch from the biofilm that stretched down to cover everything below her neck during suspension prodded her into action . She made her way quickly towards her bay ’ s barracks and attached ready room to prepare for her shift . <newline> <newline> With a twist , Dina toggled a shower stall and stepped into the steady stream . The water was lukewarm and salty , swimming with enzymes that would dissolve the biofilm from her body . She reached up and ran her fingers through dark , straight hair that fell to the middle of her back - it would have to be cut , as she did every two or three rotations as there were few opportunities to groom it beyond cutting . This shower would be the longest of the month-long shift ; the computer limited available water for three minutes for conservation purposes . As a ship ’ s systems technician , Dina had found a bypass which would allow for another two minutes . It had taken her three rotations to discover and while she had the ability to lengthen every shower , Dina limited herself to the first one upon waking . Now , as the fifth minute passed Dina stepped out to dress and receive the shift ’ s assignments . <newline> <newline> Humanity had reached the stars , but the holy grail that was faster-than-light travel eluded them . Scientists and engineers had made great strides in cryogenic suspension and stasis . Ships like Dina ’ s would carry dozens of crew , hundreds of passengers , and tons of supplies across the silent void of space . Rotations varied depending of the size of the vessel , but a month up and seven years under became standard - as well , only a single crewman needed to be awake at a time due to the mostly automated starship . The human technicians served as another layer of redundancy . <newline> <newline> Dina certainly felt redundant the first week and a half of her shift , with little work to be done save the scrubbing of a number of plasma conduits . The tedium and dullness of the work rarely fazed her and she completed it unflinchingly , mechanically . While Dina and her fellow technicians were not as strenuously trained as Earth ’ s earliest astronauts , she could perform her work passably well and was , most importantly , mentally predisposed to being able to cope with loneliness of her rotations . <newline> <newline> As the second week dragged to a close , an insistent beeping from a screen in the mess hall caught Dina ’ s attention mid-bite . She frowned at the pulsing screen , swallowing slowly as she continued eating . She ate methodically , perplexed and a bit annoyed at the sudden alarm ’ s interruption of her bland meal - her routine . Her boring routine . Dina liked her boring routine . Granted she recognized the alarm ’ s tone as a low-level problem and thus had the luxury to chew and chew . Rolling the cud of pressed nutrient in her mouth , she sat until the annoyance of the flashing light and continuing chime drove her towards the screen . She stabbed at the screen with her finger , ending the alarm and bringing up the awaiting message . Her frown deepened as she noted the alarm originated from one of the secondary access shafts that ran along the ship ’ s bulkhead , just outside the gravity well created by the spinning motion of the crewed sections . She hated working in those areas , having to rely on clunky magnetic boots and tethers . Having just finished eating , the prospect of weightlessness caused her stomach to metaphorically sink - a distinct possibility in reality with a full belly . As she pried the last bits of mush from around her mouth with her tongue , she realized that the error message was unfamiliar : 1E22E4 . Her eyes narrowed in thought as her thumb worried her lower lip , going back through the strings of errors she had memorized in the training modules before going underway . Nothing came . <newline> <newline> An hour later , Dina ’ s harness was clipped safely onto the rails welded to the bulkhead as she made her way to the location of the curious error . Diagnostic tools hung from her belt , rising and falling in the near-zero gravity as she kicked her way along the access shaft . She finally reached the spot indicated on her service tablet ’ s map - the section was nondescript , access panels giving way to conduits that bundled fiber optic cables , power converters , and the rest of the ship ’ s guts . On the outer bulkhead , though , there was an panel - a door , really - sized for a person . Dina blinked in realization as she swiped through schematics on the tablet on her wrist , highlighting the ship ’ s modular defense bays . The bays were peppered across the vessel ’ s hull , awaiting the interchangeable pods to allow the mounting of defense systems . Dina was grateful for the decades of relative peace that left most of the ship ’ s bays empty . Still , there was the matter of the error and so toggled open the access panel . <newline> <newline> The bay was dark when she entered , the motion-sensitive lights warming up and cast a pale white glow . Here , the gravity was zero and so Dina placed her heavy boots on the deck , stamping on the heel twice to activate the magnetic soles . Walking around the bay this way was cumbersome , her feet lifted sluggishly from the deck in a way reminiscent of trudging through snow . She paced the perimeter of the brick shaped space , scanning the room for any irregularities which may have triggered the alarm . The air did not seem off to her as she sniffed it , indicating that life support was fully functional . As she continued her circuit of the bay , Dina checked her service tablet again for the error . She stopped as she could not find the error message any longer . Her lips pursed together as she continued to scroll through the error logs , finding nothing . She let out an annoyed sigh and moved back toward the panel when she noticed an open workstation against a wall . Dina stepped closer as quickly as possible , ignoring the resisting tug from the floor . <newline> <newline> Free from the usual clutter of an active workstation , Dina only noticed a square board set upon the surface . It was obviously once a small access panel , but now it was laying on a workstation with two neat rows of figures upon a grid . She dragged a finger over the lines noting that they were burned in , likely with a plasma torch . The workstation surface was magnetized , which kept the board and the figures from floating around the bay . The figures themselves had been cut in a similar way from another piece of panel . She settled onto her haunches , staring at the figures . She remembered this , sitting on her grandfather ’ s knee while he moved the pieces and explained them to her . Dina reached out and fingered the one piece painted white- a pawn - sitting out in the center . She wondered who had done this - who had the time or even the gumption to craft the set and lay it out in a deserted , rarely visited bay . There were eighty-three other people on the technician crew , all strangers as none of them would meet during their rotations . Who ? <newline> <newline> Dina chewed her bottom lip as she considered whether or not to log this - she had spent two hours now chasing this error message with other maintenance requests building up from the ship ’ s computer . Not only was the error now gone , but she had entered this part of the ship which most certainly had been logged . She stood upright and stared at the board , thinking with her hands down at her sides . The thought came to her to just change the entrance log for the bay and the service shaft , but it would not be simple . Dina was reasonably confident that she could manage it with the last week she had if she cut short her meal-times and even skipped a shower here and there . The question remained : what to do about the board and its pieces . She stretched out a hand and opened a recycling port set to the left of the station . Grasping the board , she began to lift it - the magnetized surface resisted her efforts long enough to give her pause . Fingers still on the board ’ s edge , she eyed the white piece sitting alone in the center of the board . Someone had gone through the trouble - with a sweep of her hand , Dina moved the piece directly across from the white pawn and met it at the center of the board . She slipped a short sigh as she slapped the toggle and closed the recycling port , turning away and returning to the bay ’ s access panel . <newline> <newline> Dina stamped her heel twice and began to float once more . She looked back at the workstation and the board with its pieces from the bay entrance . A beeping from her service tablet roused her , directing her attention to an urgent service request . She sighed to herself and glided through the bay opening and back into the service shaft , sealing the room before moving on to the next issue somewhere across the ship . <newline>

1,"“ Welcome to Hell. ” <newline> There in front of me stood a beast , horned with glaring teeth . Its skin was a dark , blood red , and on each one of its boney fingers was a black claw . <newline> <newline> I looked around my surroundings . Dark caves , brown and red dirt , and eternal fire . Far in the distance , I heard cackling , crying , and ghastly calls . I felt a strong heat , but I didn ’ t burn . <newline> “ Hell ? ” I asked , seemingly innocent . <newline> <newline> The beast leaned in towards me where I stood , on a platform over bubbling lava , and bared its teeth in a crazy grin . <newline> <newline> “ Yes , child . Hell . I am the darkness , the despair , the wrath , the shadows , the hatred , and the sadness . I am revenge , and I am destruction . I have many names , but you may know me as Satan. ” <newline> <newline> Satan stood tall and looked down upon me as I coward on my platform . His eyes were a deep green , and they told a million stories I felt I would never have time to hear . <newline> <newline> “ Have you yet remembered , child ? ” he asked me . <newline> <newline> “ Remembered what ? ” I asked . <newline> <newline> “ Why , yourself . Have you remembered why you ’ ve been sent to me ? ” <newline> <newline> I looked down to the lava and let my thoughts flow . They came slowly to me , starting with the concept of Hell , and I began to panic . Hell was a place of torture and pain , meant for those who caused torture and pain , and now here I was , standing in front of eternal judgement . <newline> <newline> And yet , I remembered my death in a flash , and I almost again relived it . Running from my fear , a bridge , a bullet , and the water . And then I was here , dried from my death by the black pit . That explained to me how I had been sent to Hell , but not why . <newline> <newline> “ Why am I here ? ” I asked Satan . <newline> <newline> “ Think harder , my child , ” he pressed . <newline> <newline> And I did , trying to let the story of my death be told . <newline> <newline> I was running from my fears , from an enemy . From a past lover , who was chasing me from my home . I had made it to the bridge over the river before he caught up to me , and we fought , and it became a blur to my mind after that point . I was sure I had smashed into the river , however . <newline> <newline> “ I have died , and I suppose I was not adequate enough for Heaven , ” I sighed . <newline> <newline> Satan stomped a hooved foot on the ground , and one of the stalagmites of the underworld fell across the pit of lava , offering a bridge . <newline> <newline> “ Walk with me in my kingdom , child. ” <newline> <newline> I was not going to challenge him , and so I walked beside him . We walked over flowing lava rivers , through pits , and past demons who only glared at me . I shivered , even through the heat , fearing that soon , the demons would become my eternal pain . <newline> <newline> “ Child , you were exceptional in your life . You gave much to charity , and you offered more of your time than ever was deserved by those who received it . You accepted those below you , and lived your life in such a way that no pain or misery was ever caused to others . Truly , you were ideal , ” Satan said . <newline> <newline> “ May I ask why I am here , if that is so ? ” I boldly asked , though I worried I had gone too far . Satan just laughed . <newline> <newline> “ You were murdered , child . Taken before your time . Not to mention the endless torture you suffered from those who wronged you during your life . A significant other who abused you , a father who did the same , and overall an unfair world . And yet , you were strong. ” <newline> <newline> Satan and I stopped walking on a ledge , which hung over an enormous castle , the bricks black as the darkness itself . Demons and monstrosities alike were swarming the castle . <newline> <newline> “ Hell is ever-changing , my child . It is endless , and therefore is not constant . As more and more corrupt souls are sent here for their punishment , more workers are needed to carry out said torture . But , it takes a certain kind of soul to come here and torture those for an eternity , and I believe you are one of those souls. ” <newline> <newline> I looked up to the devil himself in awe at what he was telling me . <newline> <newline> “ You want me to torture ? ” I gasped . <newline> <newline> “ Of course . But , not just any souls , my child. ” <newline> <newline> Satan took a deep breath and released a splitting roar . In moments , a smaller demon came flying from the castle , carrying a writhing human . As the demon neared , I recognized the human as my past lover , and I almost wanted to run . <newline> <newline> “ Fear not , my child , for I will not let you be hurt again. ” <newline> <newline> My past lover was dropped at my feet , cowering in fear . <newline> <newline> “ This sad soul caused you nothing but misery . In the end , this soul committed suicide after killing you , and now is here , ready for eternal punishment by you. ” <newline> <newline> I looked down at my past lover , watching it shiver and cry . And , at that moment , I felt so much anger that I thought I could explode into a ball of fire . <newline> <newline> “ This is the ultimate gift , my child , ” Satan said , leaning down to me . “ You are free to have revenge on those who wronged you , and similar souls . You may rule your own part of Hell and torture as you see fit , for an eternity. ” <newline> <newline> “ Me ? ” I whispered , looking back at my past lover . <newline> <newline> “ Of course. ” <newline> <newline> “ What would happen if I denied it ? ” I asked . <newline> <newline> “ Well , you have been denied entry in to Heaven for your lack of religious schedule , but I do not see torture fit for you . You have done nothing harmful to those around you to deserve it , and so , I can only offer you a home in my kingdom , wherever you please . You do not need to eat , drink , or sleep , but you can do as you please . But , find , there is no end purpose to life here in the underworld , so you will be doomed to walk the lands forever , ” Satan explained . <newline> <newline> “ Would the purpose not be the same in Heaven ? ” I asked . <newline> <newline> “ The purpose of Heaven is purpose . You are to serve on the royal council under the lord , God , and you shall never see the faces of those who wronged you . You do not need to serve me here , for I do not need praise . I only need to keep balance . '' <newline> <newline> I thought about the offer , and almost considered it . I wouldn ’ t want to brag about myself , but Satan had been correct on his description of me . I dedicated my entire life to others , and now that I had no life , was it finally time to dedicate my life to me ? <newline> <newline> “ Satan , if I were to spend the rest of my eternity torturing bad souls , am I no better than the bad souls who tortured me ? ” <newline> <newline> Satan bellowed at my words and gave me a pat on the back that was so hard , I thought I may fall off the ledge . <newline> <newline> “ I enjoy your humor , child , but this is the end of the line . There is nothing more . You ’ re not going to Heaven , and there ’ s nothing deeper than hell . Although you have no purpose , you are free here . This is your eternity , to do with as you choose. ” <newline> <newline> He made sense . I finally had nothing to lose , and I would gain some feeling of righteousness inside of me . I felt powerful as my past lover looked up to me with sad eyes , the same way I had looked before I died . And then I nodded . <newline> <newline> “ Satan , ” I began . “ I accept this offer . Not in the sense that I myself am getting revenge , but I can continue living my life for others who are victims of the crazy souls such as this one. ” <newline> <newline> Satan clapped his clawed hands and laughed , a harsh sound that echoed throughout the underworld . <newline> <newline> “ Amazing , my child ! I can not believe you were denied Heaven . You truly are outstanding , and I appreciate your acceptance . Now , come with me , and I will show you the way of righteousness . ”

1,"** ( This is a short shitty rough draft for a shitty short story I wrote that heavily apes from Fight Club , Mr . Robot , and Hotline Miami . Basically it 's from the POV of a college kid who interns for a clickbait-y Buzzfeed-ish blog , but his editor is *forcing* him to be part of the sensationalized stories that he writes about . I kinda wan na expand this one day but I have n't really had the time or energy to in-between school and work , lol . Honest feedback appreciated . ) ** <newline> <newline> On a clear day , you can see forever . In a Dodo bird mask , you can only see in vignettes . Wide , vacuous black circles , grasping at the fringes of your peripheral vision , futilely clawing at the seams to lift themselves from the void of extinction . Alright , maybe that ’ s a little hyperbolic , but even through the sedation and latex I can smell the doldrums of the Shit ’ s Creek I waded myself into . Even through the void I can feel the vibrations of my smartphone bursting to life , the blue LED light radiating through my palms , through the blackness , suffocating the melatonin supply to my brain . <newline> <newline> I didn ’ t want to pick up , I didn ’ t want to answer from that sanctimonious fuck , I didn ’ t want to know how far up Shit ’ s Creek I paddled , but I twiddled my thumbs through the zip ties and slid that lock button anyway . It was either that , or becoming nothing more than a byline , yet another member of the collective pile of meaningless stardust that collectively finished playing the meaningless charade . <newline> <newline> In Blackjack , you have a 1 in 21 chance of beating the dealer . In American Roulette , you have a 1 in 38 chance of nailing that ball on the jackpot . In Russian Roulette , you have a 1 in 6 chance of embedding a .38 into your skull . In a couple billion years time , the sun has a 100 % chance of metastasizing into a red giant and swallowing the ethos of human achievement down the incendiary drain . *Place your bets . * <newline> <newline> Lifting my hands up to my ears ( or lack thereof ) like the dumb-assed Dodo I was , all I could muster through the mask was a meek , pathetic “ Hello ? ” And all the sanctimonious fuck could muster in return was “ Not everyday you wake up riding shotgun toward revolution in a latex Dodo bird mask , is it Bo ? ” Fucking hell . What did I do ? What did he do ? What did we do ? “ Coming down from the Venti yet ? Takes a lot of sugar and horse tranquilizers to bring down a guy your size. ” <newline> <newline> One minute Quade ’ s got me the most badass , high-paying freelance Gonzo journalist gig around . The next , he ’ s got me drugged in the random ass passenger seat of a random ass car on Arch Street .

What good transportation will that white van you ’ re in be without a wheel to guide it ? What good is that salary I ’ ve been paying you for , besides flooding your veins with carcinogens and killing yourself over a fucking piece of paper ? What good is anything worth if we ’ re all just circlejerking each other off into the Great Cosmic Toilet ? ” <newline> <newline> I should ’ ve been more anxious . I should ’ ve felt the warm blood and adrenaline and carcinogens flowing through my arteries realizing how far I ’ ve paddled up Shit ’ s Creek . I ’ ve should ’ ve cried out begging , pleading for my life and all the other innocent lives down the block . I should ’ ve shouted through the void that no Quade , I was killing myself over TWO fucking pieces of paper , and that I hated driving anyways , but all Bo the Dumb-Assed Dodo could muster through the drugs was a pathetic , monotone “ I dunno ” . <newline> <newline> Yes , here we were , you , me , the arid sense of extinction , vaguely chemical aroma , and faint ticking permeating through the humid summer air , and all I could respond to that was a fucking “ I dunno ” . “ Exactly , ” Quad responded , “ Who does ? We ’ ve all been sleeping through a stupor for the past fourteen billion years , but today Bo , you , I , and the rest of my reporters will give the world a wake-up call . Today , you will have severed one of the Hydra ’ s main heads . Today , ten minutes from now , you and the rest of my news team will end this morning imprinting everlasting phosphoric footprints all over the country . Remember that saying I told you on your first beat ? ” <newline> <newline> I knew you knew he knew about that saying , so I didn ’ t give him the satisfaction of explaining it all over again . Instead , I responded with the most logical retort that a drugged up hostage wearing a latex Dodo mask could muster : “ Crocodiles can ’ t talk ! ” . I felt around the leather seat for a belt buckle . *Bingo* . Unclasping the damn thing was easy ; getting out of the van would be far from it . <newline> <newline> The blood was flowing back to my hands . I pounded my knuckles raw against the window and futilely grasped at the lock . No dice . I yelled out to the possible families , to the droves of hypothetical white-collared businessmen , to the residential strung-out soft-pretzel selling , sax-playing homeless guys , but my message was left unheard through the tinted , soundproof , bulletproof reinforced windows . *Did you hear it ? Quade did . * “ You think they give two shits about the revolution ? ” <newline> <newline> He was right . The bastard got me into this meaningless , terroristic nonsensical mess , all for the sake of paying for two fucking pieces of paper , but he was right . The people didn ’ t want to be told . They wanted a tangible aesthetic , instant visual stimuli to materialize , and then and only then would they give two shits . In T-minus nine minutes Quade ’ s magnum opus would materialize , and me and the U.S. Mint would be no more , all because of… ... *Two* fucking pieces of paper ? Wads of meaningless pieces of paper money ? Search Engine Optimization ? God basking in his morbid sense of humor with the ultimate prank : crippling the already decrepit U.S. economy with the final nail in the coffin ? <newline> <newline> No . If God was up there , he wouldn ’ t let things get this FUBAR . He wouldn ’ t make I , Bo “ the Dumb Assed Dodo ” Kaczynski , wannabe Gonzo journo , part-time busboy , and tentative community college freshman , the reluctant face of the Meaningless Revolution . He sure as hell wouldn ’ t have been cool with me roleplaying as him in some shitty dollar store Halloween mask . <newline> <newline> I pictured the lemmings outside , blissfully stuck in their morning routines , following perpetual motion , obliviously walking toward the cliffside , and I envied them . It beat being stuck rotting minute to minute in this steel coffin , with nobody to hear my cries for help besides me , Quade , and you , my solipsistic friend . *Do you know what that word means ? Do I know what that word means ? Is there any fucking clarity to be found within the black void of a Dodo bird mask ? * <newline> <newline> `` Will you *relax* ? ” Quade said , “ I ’ m granting you an eternal afterlife of bylines and SEOs , and this is the thanks I get ? Begging ? ! ? ? ” My hands grasped up top at the seams of the Dodo mask . No dice . “ Ah well , you ’ ll be thanking me in seven minutes time . By the way , you like my super glue dye job ? ” <newline> <newline> Now , this might be the part of the story where you ’ re screaming at me to wake up and dial 9-1-1 , or my mom , or my buddy Rico that I haven ’ t talked to since graduation . Possible prison time and embarrassing bald spots don ’ t seem so bad when your other option is extinction . But I ’ ve got more stories to tell . That ’ s all we ’ ve got , right ? <newline> <newline> Well , that , a latex Dodo bird mask , a smartphone , six minutes to kill , and one-in-two odds of toppling the economy like dominoes , all for the byline of the century and two fucking pieces of paper . <newline> <newline> *Place your bets . * <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"It all felt like such a rush . Frist came the explosion . Not an ordinary one ; I had seen my fair share of those . It had the same kind of feeling you ’ d get from waving your hand in front of an old TV , but all over your body . As the wave of energy passed , the storm began to erupt . Lightning without the thunde-wait , that 's right . The music made did make it to the rave , albeit fashionably late . Then I ran , I ran so far away . Well , not so much away as it was towards the center of the storm . He ’ d be there , I could feel it in my bones . Along with the whole “ lightning-storm-appears-during-beautiful-day-out-of-the-blue ” shtick . This would make the third time this month I had seen it . <newline> <newline> And here we are now , in some abandoned warehouse at the edge of a dock . A lighting-powered speed demon reminiscent of a Flash villain , and me . Oh shit , that ’ s right ! I haven ’ t even introduced myself . I can ’ t believe I forgot my man- <newline> <newline> “ I can ’ t even COMPREHEND how you fell for this , Whirlpool . I mean , seriously ! Did you HONESTLY THINK that running headfirst into my storm was the best course of action ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Could you not monologue for TWO SECONDS ! ” <newline> <newline> The look in his eyes tells me he ’ s offended . “ I wasn ’ t monologuing , ” he fires back , “ I was asking you a question. ” <newline> <newline> “ A RHETORICAL QUESTION. ” <newline> <newline> He rushed at me in a millisecond . The cracks in the concrete make a quaint path behind him . For a speedster , he rarely thinks about his situation thoroughly . Maybe the speed doesn ’ t affect his brain , only his movement . I ’ ll make a mental note of that . <newline> <newline> I could see I stuck a nerve this time . The spandex-clad speedster is in my face now , less than an inch from it , in fact . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m gon na ’ make sure you rot in that river . You hear me , water boy ? ” His tone is stone-cold . Not enough to match Steve Austin , but pretty damn close . <newline> <newline> “ Sorry , I missed that . Could you get a bit closer and repeat it to me ? ” <newline> <newline> The next second or two are a blur . All I know for sure is that I shouldn ’ t have ticked off the guy with super speed , especially when hanging like a slaughtered pig . Lightning flickered off of his arms after laying about fifty punches into me . <newline> <newline> “ So , I ’ m curious Bargain Bin Barry Allen , does the lightning show up every time you ’ re beating meat , or am I just special ? ” <newline> <newline> WHAM <newline> <newline> The lightning illuminates the building , making it a spectacle for the dock workers outside . Let ’ s hope they ’ re not stupid and run in here . Then I might actually have to worry about something . <newline> <newline> I smell smoke . <newline> <newline> “ DON ’ T ‘ CHU KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP ? ! ” <newline> <newline> This is too easy . <newline> <newline> “ Because I just LOVE the sound of my own voice . It reminds me of Beethoven ’ s 9th. ” <newline> <newline> Like taking candy from a baby . If that baby was super fast . And in a rusty-ass warehouse . And somehow stupider than an actual baby . <newline> <newline> The idiot in the ridiculous costume ( No , not me . ) lets out a gut-wrenching howl . Full of anger and emotion I haven ’ t felt in a while . The noise rings all throughout the hollow interior of the wreck that is this shithole . I bet that scream could be heard for miles . If the goons working the docks haven ’ t called the cops yet , the cops will probably come now . I give ‘ em 10 minutes . 7 if I can get him to do it again . <newline> <newline> I look up at the rope I ’ m hanging from , which is slowly but surely becoming a small thread . I ’ m thanking God that Speedy Gonzalez over there doesn ’ t look up , or else he ’ d see the flames coming off the only thing between his face and my fist right now . <newline> <newline> Come on . 3… 2… Aaaaaaaaaaand… <newline> <newline> Seriously ? How is this fuc-SNAP <newline> <newline> I hit the ground like a dumbbell . It doesn ’ t hurt initially , just stings like a bitch . <newline> <newline> “ Are you serious ? ” His face is almost laughable . The confusion washes over him like… well , I won ’ t spoil my plan . <newline> <newline> “ Ya know , after all the times we fought before , I never got your name . You know mine , so it ’ s only fair I get yours. ” <newline> <newline> He attempts to prop himself up , giving off a false sensation of confidence . <newline> <newline> “ I am the Blue Bolt ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Like the dog from the Pixar movie ? ” <newline> <newline> “ NO , NOT LIKE THE DOG FROM THE PIXAR MOVIE ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Are you sure ? ‘ Cuz I ’ m fairly certain… ” <newline> <newline> And just like that , we are out in the storm . I feel the burning pain in my ribs from where he tackled me . Along with the rest of the punches he laid into me in the meantime . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m gon na ’ be honest with you , Aqua-Dweeb , I thought you ’ d have more of a fight in ya ’ this time ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh no , I ’ m a lover , not a fighter . But when I do , it ’ s a landslide. ” <newline> <newline> I move a bit closer to the edge of the dock , right by the waterfront . Power swells through me , like Frankenstien ’ s monster being brought to life . <newline> <newline> Then I hit him with all I ’ ve got . <newline> <newline> The wave crashes down on him harder than anything he ’ s done to me thus far . He tries to run , but he just isn ’ t fast enough where it counts ; his noggin . <newline> I walk over to his drenched body , now covered in seaweed and a disgusting new smell I don ’ t think will come out of his clothes for weeks . And just as the clouds start to part , and the Big Bad Bolt slowly sinks into unconsciousness , I give him a smug look and say : <newline> <newline> “ Or a tsunami , in this case. ” <newline> <newline> First time writing on here . Hope you enjoyed ! <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"Anything goes ? Ok ... Sharing this one.. <newline> <newline> The Exeter Incident . <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> Chapter 1 : The Storm <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Bridge to Captain. ” <newline> <newline> Francesca “ Francis ” Drake groaned . It seemed like only minutes since she 'd laid down on her bunk after finishing reviewing performance evaluations , or evils as they were known in the service . She rolled out of her 'rack ' and hit the button on the intercom . <newline> <newline> “ Captain here , this had better be good X.O. ” <newline> “ Sorry to disturb your sleep Ma'am , but we got a weather flash from base . Storm Able Baker 12 has changed course and is heading our way. ” <newline> <newline> Captain Drake sighed , and glancing at the clock on the bulkhead thought about saying something unprofessional , it had only been thirty minutes since she put her head down . <newline> <newline> “ I 'm on my way up X.O , put the kettle on. ” <newline> “ Right away Ma'am. ” <newline> <newline> Francis pulled her uniform jacket on , and stopping long enough to pull a comb through her regulation bob-cut hair , exited the tiny cabin that was her personal space and out into the corridor . It was a short jog up the deck and climb up a ladder and she was in the cavernous ventral axial companion way that ran the entire length of the ship between the twin gas bags that made up 80 % of the Exeter . <newline> <newline> Captain 'Francis ' Drake paused out of long habit , listening to the RNV Exeter around her . The thin high whistle of the wind over the rigid carbon composite skin of her told Francis that the wind outside was already picking up . The occasional twanging shudder that ran the length of the 1500ton 750ft long craft , as well as the subtle tingling vibration of hard driven rain rattling against the hull transmitted though the deck plating and felt though the soles of her soft uniform boots , told her everything she needed to know about the conditions outside . <newline> <newline> Upon reaching the bridge her Executive officer , or X.O , Commander Edward Declaan handed Francis a cup of freshly brewed tea without a word . Francis ' gaze swept the three deck high , bridge , looking around the stations at the same time as she assessed the sky seen though the hemispherical bridge window that dominated the forward view . Calmly she walked forward to the 'pulpit ' or the command station , a 270 degree bank of command stations with the captain 's chair at the centre of the three quarter circle , all perched on an armoured pillar containing the critical bridge systems , in the precise centre of the spherical space of the bridge . <newline> <newline> Francis walked over to Navigation and looked over the crewman 's shoulder at the plot , wisely enough it was already showing the chart of North Atlantic storm AB12 , as well as the projected plot of it 's course . <newline> <newline> “ X.O ... maybe it 's just me , but did that storm get worse from this morning ? ” <newline> “ Yes Captain . It 's been upgraded to a Force 10. ” <newline> “ Bloody hell.. ” <newline> <newline> The RNV Exeter was supposed to avoid anything over Force 8 . At 1500 tons and 750ft long , she was a minnow in comparison to the latest Excalibur class dirigible carriers . The Exeter had been built 20 years ago , at the tail-end of the cold war , intended to serve as a flying airfield to launch interceptor planes in case of circumpolar Soviet bomber attack , she was re-tasked as a North Atlantic patrol vessel . She was old , cramped and woefully under-powered for her displacement . And Francis would n't swap her for any other ship in the fleet . <newline> <newline> “ Helm , take us to heading 153 true , and see if you can crank her up a few more knots. ” <newline> “ Aye , Aye Ma'am . Heading 153 true , and annoying the Chief ! ” <newline> <newline> Francis snorted at the humour from the lieutenant . The Chief Engineers attitude was a thing of legend , and asking his precious child to go a bit faster than her already rapid speed would indeed , annoy him . She sat down in her chair as helm executed the course change . <newline> <newline> The deck plating tilted as the ponderous mass of the dirige-craft turned to head at right-angles to the storms course , hoping to get around it . The thrumm of it 's Rolls-Royce Electro-Ducted-Fan [ EDF ] turbines nudged up from barely noticeable in the background to teeth-gratingly present . Sure enough , her comms ear-bug whistled with an incoming private call . <newline> <newline> “ Engineering to the Captain. ” <newline> “ Cap , go engineering. ” <newline> “ Begging your pardon Ma'am , but do I need to be reminding you about the forward reactor that 's cold ? ” <newline> “ No Chief . You do n't . But if we ca n't get just a few more knots out of the old girl , we 're all going to have lots more on our plates to worry about shortly. ” <newline> <newline> There was momentary pause , and Francis wondered if some of the worry had leaked through in her voice . Chief Engineer Scott was a decent man , for all that he was Irish , but he was prone to express his dissatisfaction volubly and within earshot of ratings at times , something that had earned him a rather spotty service record in the Royal navy . <newline> <newline> “ How soon before it all drops in the pot Ma'am ? ” <newline> <newline> Francis ' eyebrow raised a scant fraction of inch at that , but she ignored the idiom and answered the Chief . <newline> <newline> “ About an hour , Gods willing Chief. ” <newline> “ Very well Ma'am , I can get you full combat speed in twenty , but I would n't recommend holding her there long. ” <newline> “ How ! ? You do n't have spare fusion reactor in your parts locker do you Chief ? ” <newline> “ No Ma'am ... I wish ... but I can hotwire the quench capacitors on the stellaroter to take a jump charge and restart her cold. ” <newline> “ Gods man ! Do n't tell me that 's by the book ! ” <newline> “ No Ma'am , it 's not . But it will work . You have my oath on it. ” <newline> “ Chief , your oath is n't going to do me much good if you blow off the bows of my ship . But since I do n't doubt you 'll be standing right next to it when you cold start the beast , I will take it . And I 'll stand you and your crew a round when we get back to Firth. ” <newline> “ Thank you Ma'am ... we 'll be ready for glory or damnation in ten minutes . Chief out. ” <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> and the rest can be found [ here . ] ( https : //archiveofourown.org/works/7192310 ? view_full_work=true )

1,"`` So let 's spitball some ideas , okay ? Any takers ? '' It was almost depressing how close the question was to genuine pleading , made even more awkward by the silence that followed . In my experience public speakers were never `` mediocre '' , it was very much black and white , and this man was clearly having a bad day . <newline> <newline> `` Anyone ? '' <newline> <newline> You did n't really want to pity him but it was hard not to at this point . But as if an angel sent from above , a single hand was raised , and his face lit up with so much relief and joy you could n't help but crack smile . <newline> <newline> `` Ah , yes you in the middle , what is your name ? '' He said , now beaming with pride . <newline> <newline> `` Emily . '' said , the fabulously pink back of the head two rows in front of me and three spaces to the left , Emily . <newline> <newline> The speaker was really catching his stride now , visibly more confident , impressive how much of a difference one person can make . `` Okay Emily , what i want you to do is just give me the elevator pitch to inspire the rest of us . Is that okay with you ? <newline> <newline> If anything , she seemed less nervous than him and answered `` Yeah sure . '' without hesitation . There are only two types of people that confident , and my suspicion was leaning one way a lot more than the other . <newline> <newline> `` So basically , a band performing on a floating stage in a lake can only stand by and watch as the entire audience succumbs to a zombie outbreak . '' <newline> <newline> Murmurs start up almost immediately as the speaker tries to regain control of the floor . `` Eeehokay okay that 's , well , an interesting scenario . Presumably the band is safe because the zombies ca n't swim but they eventually turn to actual cannibalism in desperation maybe ? '' He was trying so hard , it was actually kinda impressive . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , i never thought it through that far , but i guess that could work . '' <newline> <newline> The speaker looked a little defeated now , but was still holding together for the most part , laughing nervously `` well , how about we just move onto the next one ? Yes , you in the orange shirt . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ok. '' The voice behind me , presumably belonging to someone wearing an orange shirt , answered . `` Aliens have been walking the planet for ages , covering up their features with dark cloth and using superior stealth technology to move around virtually undetected . '' <newline> <newline> The speaker pinched the bridge of his nose , pushing his glasses up in the process . `` So what you are saying , '' he started `` Is that Ninjas are actually aliens in disguise . '' <newline> <newline> Mr. Orange only response was an enthusiastic `` Yeah ! '' <newline> <newline> These idiots were clearly all plum morons as far as storytelling was concerned , it was time I taught them all a lesson . I raised my hand confidently , an idea already brewing . <newline> <newline> I could tell he sighed before resolving to give it one more go , as he turned to me . `` Yes yes , you with the cat ear headphones , go on ahead . '' <newline> <newline> I flashed a devious grin , for none of these charlatan asses knew they were in the presence of a storytelling god . <newline> <newline> `` So '' I begin , relishing the moment . `` A sea cucumber and a humpback whale are subject to the effects of nuclear testing ...

1,"**THALASSOPHOBIA** <newline> <newline> <newline> Dan did n't like going to the pool . He had Thalassophobia , though he did not know the correct term for his fear . He was only 6 and had not investigated his strange fear of the water . He had not told his parents about his fear either , because he was afraid they might think him insane if he said that he was afraid of the water . Dan 's parents would have understood of course , but as he was rather young , Dan did not know this . <newline> <newline> <newline> All he knew was that he was afraid of the water . <newline> <newline> <newline> That 's why he was n't exactly happy when he was being dragged away to the pool by his older brother , 18 year old Dennis . <newline> <newline> <newline> Dan 's parents had gone out for a bit , and they had told their sons that they could spend the day at the pool while they were out . There was now no one to say , `` Leave your brother alone , Dennis ! '' or `` Do n't make Dan go to the pool if he does n't want to ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> But as their parents were n't around , Dennis had successfully bullied Dan into going to the pool with him . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Come on , do n't you like going to the pool ? Are you afraid of the water or something ? '' Dennis asked . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` N-no ... I just d-do n't want to go to the pool t-today '' , stuttered Dan in-between sobs . The only reason he had not told Dennis the truth was because of the old childish fear of not wanting to be called insane . Otherwise , he would have screamed that he hated the water and would 've told Dennis to go to the pool by himself . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> So they went to the pool . Dennis jumped in immediately , but no matter what happened or what anyone said Dan was n't going to get into that horrible pool . It was a rather small pool , not very deep , but Dan was terrified of it . He always thought that there would be some giant monster lurking in it , or that he would drown in the seemingly bottomless pool and would be never found again . To him , the 25m pool was an ocean . <newline> <newline> <newline> Dennis , mischievously thinking that he would grab Dan and pull him into the pool -- and maybe teach him swimming -- went up to Dan who was sitting by the edge if the pool and looking into the depths , grabbed his feet and pulled him into the pool . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was Dan 's worst nightmare . All he knew was that something from the terrifying depths of the pool had grabbed and was going to take him to his watery grave . <newline> <newline> <newline> Dan looked up . He could still see the people swimming on the surface , he could also hear muffled , panicked shouting . He could see the surface all right , but he could n't see the sides of the pool . He could n't see the bottom of his nightmare either . Now he could n't hear anything , everything was drifting away and going black , he could n't breathe as he drifted to the bottom of this never ending ocean . <newline> <newline> <newline> Then he screamed . There it was , grinning up at him , his worst nightmare . A giant fish of some sort . It had extremely small eyes , a large head that bore huge crescent shaped teeth . It was n't just big , it was absolutely *massive* . Larger than the largest thing in the entire universe . <newline> <newline> <newline> Dan could n't swim . <newline> <newline> <newline> The creature opened it 's mouth and all was black . <newline> <newline> <newline> When Dan woke up , there was a crowd of people around him , including his parents . Dennis came up to him looking terrified and white . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` A-Are you okay ? I 'm sorry , I 'll never do that again '' , he said . All around Dan there was talk about how Dan had nearly drowned and how he had some sort of seizure in the water . But Dan was n't listening . His worst nightmare had taken place , and now he felt truly , utterly terrified of the water . He knew he would hear something about how none of what he saw was real when his parents heard about it . But he knew what he saw was real , and he feared he would never be the same again . <newline> <newline> <newline> Dan looked at the pool , it 's water gently lapping against it 's sides . The pool looked harmless . He thought he saw something stir in it 's water .

1,"**The Memory Book** <newline> <newline> ( This is the first story I 've ever posted on this site . Constructive criticism please ! ) <newline> <newline> During a baby 's first night of living sleep , a memory book appears in their crib . This book is not too short , and not too long . It is just right , like Baby Bear 's book , filled with words , moving pictures , packets of small items like flower petals , and even scratch-n-sniff cards . After all , scent is said to have the most direct connection with memory . And although the book is created empty , it will fill with memories as the baby grows . The day the baby dies is the day the last page is filled . Some books fill within a week ; some take a century . The one similarity is that they will always have the exact number of pages needed to hold the perfect memory of the person it was created for . There has only been one exception . <newline> <newline> The baby girl 's father had set up a camera to see if he could capture the book appearing . Nobody had ever done it before - but when he filmed it forming , precariously balanced atop the wall of his daughter 's crib , it made the two of them famous . <newline> <newline> The girl 's memory book was short . At the age of eight months , her parents found her gasping for breath on the floor . It was like she was in the middle of dying from SIDS , and nobody at the hospital could figure out what was wrong . As all living people do , she eventually fell asleep , and when she awoke , she was well . <newline> <newline> Her memory book grew bigger . <newline> <newline> At the age of two years , someone obsessed with figuring out the mystery of the books finally snapped and tried to kill her , but the bullet miraculously hit a button on her clothing , and she barely managed to survive . <newline> <newline> Again , her memory book grew bigger . <newline> <newline> Life went on . The girl - now a young woman - did not try to become famous from the growth of her memory book . She stayed underground , and would notice when her book grew bigger . It was always because of little things - she was addicted to heroin for a while and used a dirty needle that should have given her a deadly disease ; she survived a heroin overdose soon after ; she just barely survived a major car crash ; when she was taking a plane to Chicago to visit her ailing father , who had filmed her book manifesting , she looked through the book and felt it widen slightly in her hands . She turned to the most recently-filled page and read how she had felt its growth only a minute before . <newline> <newline> It was usually taboo to talk about a specific person 's memory book . This made the woman 's life difficult , as people who had seen her picture in the news would bother her , and interrupt her day . One person had even grabbed her book straight out of her hands and began flipping through the pages , and she had to shove him to the ground in getting it back . Incidents like this contributed to her depression , and after surviving a suicide attempt , her husband convinced her to seek help . She found a place in helping those who survived suicide attempts overcome their own depression , and she began reforming her fame to fit that of friend rather than a miracle baby . <newline> <newline> In her early fifties , the woman 's memory book was stolen . The thief was found and convicted , although the book was never recovered . Many believe he burned it out of jealousy , as he had a daughter who had died of SIDS , just like the woman was apparently supposed to die of eight months after she was born . <newline> <newline> The woman went missing soon after . The man who had stolen her memory book recovered it out of sympathy , and it was filled to the last page . It had the details that allowed police to find her body . She had died peacefully , wanting to be alone and happy for once and allow herself a final pure rest before passing on . <newline> <newline> To this day , the memory book is something that is a complete enigma . It is a mystery beloved the world over . The woman 's book was reproduced and studied , and it is still a mystery how the thing expanded - never mind how memory books in general appear the way they do . Today , the woman is buried next to her father and her husband , finally allowed to be with them without the interruption of the fortunately unlucky .

1,"“ Newspapers , get your newspapers , only fifty cents ! Special edition ! ” <newline> <newline> Hoarse words rasped from my parched mouth as I waved a rolled-up daily in my hand , frantically trying to catch the attention of Ellensburg Labor Day parade watchers , who were evidently trying to ignore me . Thousands of people lined themselves along the street where I walked , cheering for the Rodeo Posse palominos , the musical floats , the high school marching band , and the clowns , who were probably more interesting than I was anyway . My white-and-orange carrier bag sagged with the weight of 50 unsold papers on my shoulders while loose coins jangled merrily in my pocket . Here I was , a thirteen-year old newspaper boy at the parade , an annual fixture of the Kittitas County Fair . I recall the day as if it were yesterday . <newline> <newline> “ Hey , kid ! You said five cents , right ? ” <newline> <newline> A wrinkled paw swiped at the rolled paper I was waving . <newline> <newline> “ Sir , that ’ s fifty cents . Two quarters , okay , sir ? ” <newline> <newline> He cupped his hand around his ear . “ What ? Yes , yes , five cents , I heard you. ” <newline> <newline> Between trying to snatch a paper from me and feigning deafness , the old man pulled a nickel from his wallet . <newline> <newline> “ Oh my gosh , grandpa , he said fifty cents ! ” A teenage girl appeared beside him . Frowning reproachfully at the old geezer , who was now all wide-eyed innocence , she handed me a dollar bill , “ I ’ m sorry for the trouble ; keep the change. ” <newline> <newline> Pocketing the tip , I pulled another paper from my bag and continued to bellow my sales pitch ; only 49 more to go . By the end of two hours though , I had burned through two bag refills , totaling about 150 newspapers sold . I trudged back to the circulation office half a mile away to claim my commission of a quarter per paper . Meanwhile , I was hoping to escape to the county fair , where I could burn my cash on cinnamon-covered elephant ears . <newline> <newline> However , this was wishful thinking . Because I had sold the most papers among several paperboys at the parade that day , the circulation manager enthusiastically scribbled down my name for rodeo program sales at the arena , beginning in two hours . Cursing myself for being so successful , I ran home to shower , knowing fully well that I would still stink of horse manure when I got home later . <newline> <newline> Program sales went much faster , but I only earned a dime per sale . Sweating profusely as I trotted up and down the bleachers to customers , I glared angrily at the cold-drink concession boy , who was on track to becoming a millionaire . The circulation manager , however , was thrilled at the volume of sales . She dropped by every two hours to see how things were going and left bundles of programs stacked three hundred high . My face reddened to a deeper crimson each time she came . Generous tips helped to cool my boiling temper , though . After six blistering hours of sun , dust , and fresh ink , I was relieved from my “ shift. ” <newline> <newline> Exhausted , I stumbled out of the rodeo arena with over $ 120 earned . The tips I received accounted for nearly half of the money . <newline> <newline> As I floated merrily towards the food court , I heard a cry puncture the air . <newline> <newline> “ Coca-Cola , Sprite , and more ! Get your cold drinks , only a dollar ! ” <newline> <newline> I sprinted back into the arena and spotted the concession boy , still carrying his soda tray . Running up to him , I stuffed a five-dollar bill in his hand and grabbed a Sprite . While I tore open the can and gulped it down thirstily , he pulled out four dollar bills and offered them to me . <newline> <newline> I stared down at them for a moment , thinking back to all the hard work and sweat it cost me to earn those four bucks . I glanced at his face , which was streaked with dust and sweat , just as mine was . <newline> <newline> I turned and walked away . <newline> <newline> “ Keep the change. ” <newline> ________ <newline> I wrote this essay a while back for a college application , and I 've always considered it my best writing work . I would have liked to expand it a bit more but it had to fit within a word limit unfortunately . Any comments or feedback appreciated ! <newline>

1,"This is definitely a longer one , but I hope it is worth it . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Johnathan Applepot was running . He successfully infiltrated the Federation 's STAR OF DEATH but had not been quite as successful in sabotaging the gravity cores . Johnathan could hear the Tempest Troopers closing in on him as he whizzed around the corner nearly tripping over a loose power cable . <newline> <newline> <newline> At the end of the corridor was a bulkhead door ; the door itself was of no interest , aside from the fact that it was rather forcefully shutting . Taking a flying leap , Applepot slid under the door , only to come to a stop halfway under it . <newline> <newline> <newline> ***Kachunk*** *whirrrrrrrrrrr ... click* <newline> <newline> *Well shit , * thought Applepot . As the shouting , clamoring , clanking , and clicking arrived , he let loose a stream of curses and vulgarities . <newline> <newline> `` Should n't we shoot him ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Negative , TK-421 , we 've got orders from HQ that we specifically should *not* shoot him . '' <newline> <newline> `` The hell they care ! He 's just another Resistance spy sent here , fifth one this week . It 'd free up a lot of time if we just shot him and say a turret malfunctioned . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well I do n't give the orders around here , and if HQ says we ought to , we ought to . Help me get the poor bastard out from under here . '' <newline> <newline> After several minutes of pulling , tugging , and stretching - much to the disliking of Applepot , the Tempest Troopers found their effort to no avail . <newline> <newline> `` Wait , '' said TK-421 , `` Why do n't we try the controls and actually open the door ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , good fuckin ' idea ! '' hollered Applepot , '' not at all like I was telling you guys that the whole damn time you were trying to split me in half ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Shut your mouth , or I swear on the Emperor that I will saw your foot off , '' retorted the commanding officer with an eerie tone of calm in his voice as he walked up to the door control and deftly , but forcefully tapped on the buttons . The interface informed him that it can not open due to the IT having enforced a mandatory system update , much to his extreme disliking . Muttering about paperwork , the officer and 421 walked off ; Applepot never did see them again . He contemplated what woul happen next . <newline> <newline> <newline> After several minutes of listening to the soft puffing of the air system , Applepot grew increasingly uncomfortable . The bulkhead itself triggered a safety mechanism , and though it was n't pressing too hard on his back , but the inability to move was upsetting . Suddenly he heard the sound of metered , even footsteps click-clacking towards him . As they got close , a voice asked , `` What are you doing here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` What 's it to you ? '' Applepot responded . <newline> <newline> `` Well something , I suppose . Do n't I have the right to know who 's decided to block a major corridor ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well it 's certainly not my fault I got stuck here , I 'd say it was the door 's fault . '' <newline> <newline> `` How 's it the door 's fault ? It was just responding to a close command . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , it 's the door 's fault . Say , are you going to get me out of here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't suppose I could get you out from under that door with brute force . Let me try the console . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh do n't bother with that , the IQ is enforcing a hardware update or something like that . '' <newline> <newline> `` You mean IT ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Does it matter ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I suppose not . Ar- '' <newline> <newline> `` You like that , word , 'suppose , ' do n't you ? '' interrupted Applepot . <newline> <newline> `` I sup- I guess I do . You know what , I am going to go call someone to help you out here . '' <newline> <newline> And off the soldier walked ; Applepot never did see him again . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Alright , guys this is all I have for now . I will gladly continue it if you lot want met to . Feel free to call me out on any errors and provide criticism ! <newline> <newline> Hugs !

1,"I wrote this story in Middle School but I always wanted to share it ... So here it is . I hope u enjoy . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Sandeep the Psychopath <newline> Sandeep was once a good boy who always respected his parents and everyone he knew . He was beloved in the community because he was a world renowned light weight kabaddi champion ( Pretty much when people wear underwear and fight in mud over a sock . ) Sandeep had his final challenge to beat the universal weight champion and he was known throughout the milky way glass . The champions name was Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta . Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta was 3261432947691642396142384 years old . He hasn ’ t been beaten since the creation of the sun . He has 124623654 kids . All his kids died before he was born . Before the match both of them were given an oil massage to smooth up there skin . They were going to fight at one of the most prestigious battle domes in the milky way glass . The fight usually lasted for 2000 years and a human being has never attended it . So Sandeep the champion was called after the relaxing oil massage . All his baby fat formed again . He also got super powers he can fly and shoot lasers out of his nose . The messenger then took him to the final training dome which was made out of the most expensive chocolate made from purified unicorn milk . The battle dome also had several glasses of milk from the super-fast giant golden awesome camel that can go faster than the speed of light . He can also milk himself which means produces unlimited amounts of milk . For all the divine floating babies to drink . They are very young and dependent . The fight was set to start in 30 years . Sandeep trained hard for 15 years and watched bollywood dramas for the next 15 years . Then came the time for the big match . A transporter from one of the very little known white hole lying just outside of a black hole outside of space and time . The messenger then took them to the battle dome . This battle dome was made out of purified cardboard . With a sandbox in the middle of the match . Also over there Zeus , Horace , Poseidon , Beerus ( God of destruction ) , Goku ( Super Saigon God ) , Vamana , Brahma , bottle of hellman ’ s mayonnaise and many others . Every final match there was a sacrifice among the god directed to the divine babies also known as Hamzah Qadri ’ s . Last time The Divine Bottle of Hummus was sacrifced . This time the gods voted on Goku but there was a tie between him and Hellman ’ s mayonnaise . The babies were to choose between the two . They chose goku and when Hamzah Qadri himself tried eating Goku he exloded and a supernova formed . All the gods excluding Goku , Beerus , and Hellman ’ s mayonnaise died . Sandeep and Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta survived . Plus the divine sandbox was still there . The fight was still to continue . Both were thrown into the sandbox , but Poseidon died so they can ’ t have a muddy box . Then Sandeep a former scientist made himself into a super natural being . He can form any liquids including afnoonkoon juice from the extremely rare creature called the moon koon loon toon soon afnoon doon . He then created water to hydrate the divine sandbox . The wtaer was one of the most pure forms of water in the entire universe . When put into the sandbox a water being emerged from the ground was Joshua the Bike Lord . He was riding on a bike that was fully customized with rocket boosters and butt warmers on the seat and in the cup holders there was some afnoonkoon juice . Joshua was appointed to be the referee for the fight . He had no idea what was going on when he was summoned from his 15272836465474848484929282728290948 year slumber . All they told him was that his bike was now on the black market . Including the afnoonkoon juice in the cup holders . Suddenly the great Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta exploded . So Sandeep was named the universal weight champion of the whole universe . He was congratulated and summoned back at his home town . When he came back it had been a hundred years and his village was annihilated by Joshua The Bike Lord . Then he became a poor person and he couldn ’ t even afford a grain of rice . Then he was picked up off the street by a 5 year old drug lord multi- millionaire named Bob . <newline> The End <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"`` How it Began '' <newline> <newline> *italics* NOTE : I have never written anything in my entire life but have been collecting stories from my 80-year old friend who grew up during WWII in Germany . This was inspired from a memory she has shared . Please be gentle , I know I am in no way , shape , or form a writer but would love any kind suggestions about how to tweak this ! <newline> <newline> She started smoking when she was 15 , it was in Germany just after the war . Sitting on a blanket beside the small lake , a solider came up to her and gestured at the empty space on her blanket as if asking to sit down . She nodded her head and he took off his jacket , laying it down with care . Lowering himself with ease , he unfolded his long legs in front of him . He was striking in his uniform but then again , so were all soldiers . War was funny that way . Turning an ordinary looking man into a handsome hero with the power of wool and brass buttons . <newline> <newline> She looked at him regarding him openly , taking in the profile of his brow leading down to his nose . It was rather large , but then again so was hers and besides , she had always liked those distinct French noses . She asked him if he would like to go down to the water with her but he smiled and shook his head in puzzlement and she realized he did not speak any German . He asked her something in French but she could only return his same puzzled smile and look . So they sat together in silence , side by side , staring out at the water and the people in it . <newline> <newline> After a while , he pulled out two packets of cigarettes and offered one of the packs to her . Gauolouse . She had always thought of them as very French and glamorous and so she took it without hesitation even though she had never smoked a cigarette in her life . She nodded thanks and put the pack in her purse . She watched as his long fingers opened his pack , removed a cigarette and placed it between his lips . She had seen other people smoke of course , her parents were seldom seen without a cigarette between their fingers , but this solider made it an art . He looked over at her and smiled , the cigarette bobbing between his lips , as he shifted onto his hip to get a lighter from his pocket . It was engraved silver , long and slim and as he snapped the wheel to light the flint with one hand , his other was already cupped and following the lighter up to the waiting cigarette . Fascinated , she watched as the glow from the flame illuminated the tip as he inhaled , burning the thin paper around the tobacco . Holding the smoke in for a moment , he exhaled through his nose with two billowing streams of smoke . In that instant , she knew she would be a smoker . <newline> <newline> <newline> He took his time and finished his smoke . Then , crushing the remains out on the ground he stood up and brushed off his trousers . He reached down and retrieved his jacket while she took in his movements . Touching his fingertips to the side of his forehead he nodded at her and smiled . She smiled back and made the same salute to him . She watched him walk away and then turned her attention back to the water for a while before heading back to the train station to go home . <newline> <newline> In her compartment on the train , she sat with two older couples who were all smoking . She reached into her purse and pulled out her newly gifted cigarettes , savoring the adult feeling of unwrapping her first package and removing a single slim stick . Holding it between two fingers , she realized she had no way to light it and casually turned to the man next to her and asked for a light as if she ’ d been doing it all her life . The man asked if perhaps she was a bit young to be smoking but she assured him it was an old habit . Handing her his lighter , she mimicked the movements of the French solider and then inhaled deeply as he had . Smoke filled her lungs and a stretch of violent coughing ensued . The man turned and asked her if she was all right and she , smiling triumphantly through her tears , exhaled the remaining smoke through her nose and nodded yes . <newline>

1,"***ANGEL*** <newline> <newline> When they install your ANGEL , they do n't tell you how much the fucking thing is actually going to hurt . Not the installation mind you , it 's completely painless as it grows , but the actual act of Resurrection . The supervisors hate the term `` Resurrection . '' To them it 's always a R.E.T.R . ( re-TUR ) , or Rapid Extreme Trauma Recovery for long . When the ANGEL ( another term they despise ) does *that* it brings you screaming back to reality kind of functional but definitely ready to kick ass . <newline> <newline> Mostly . <newline> <newline> Sometimes they do n't work and sometimes they only kinda work , which is a lot worse for everyone . It 's easy to get a corpse in a body bag , it 's not so easy if the corpse is technically dead but wo n't stop trashing and screaming like a drugged out perp on PCP or the dissociative du jour . <newline> <newline> Fortunately for me , it worked . Boy , oh boy , did it work . I do n't remember dying but I sure as hell remember coming back . Resurrection feels like you 've been set on fire and someone 's trying to put you out by compressing you between two glaciers . Every nerve in your body is screaming and you have absolutely no fucking idea what is happening to you . Agonizing does n't describe it , hell , there probably is n't even a word *to* describe it . To top it all off the ANGEL makes the entire experience even more frenetic by dumping epinephrine to get you from carcass to kick ass in a few seconds . That 's a bit like have a live wire jabbed up your ass . All in all , not an experience I 'd ever choose to have , but that 's probably why they 're light on the details when you agree to have it installed . <newline> <newline> The first thing I saw was the sky . Black with maybe a dozen faint points of light . That 's light pollution for you , ruining the view for most humans on this planet . The next thing I saw was my partner 's face blocking the few stars the sky had left to share . What was her name ? Young , generic ethnic mutt face , a mask of nervous hope stretched across it . This was probably the first time she 'd had to deal with a Resurrection . LJ , that was her name . Officer Li-Johnson . Tough cookie , smart , this would n't be too rough on her . Already I saw her concerned expression tempering into a relieved one . I must 've look less dead than I felt . <newline> <newline> I shot upright , almost headbutting LJ and sending her sprawling , but fortunately she jumped back , bouncing off a public internet booth . I looked down and saw the two clean holes through my chest right about where my heart was . Goddamn , that was an expensive replacement if it was too badly damaged . I whipped my head from side to side , spotted the fucker who 'd shot me and leapt up straight into a sprint . He was a mutt too , probably a bit more Han than average and a quick runner , maybe even an augment . I shot my hand down to my pistol and flicked it to maximum power , getting a loud beep as it confirmed it was at a full shot charge . He must 've heard it too because his head turned just enough for me to see fear flash across his face . At least he knew enough to know what was about to happen to him . The murder of an officer of the law while fleeing said officer had only one punishment : death . In this case , a very painful one . <newline> <newline> I skidded to a halt , dropping to one knee while simultaneously drawing my pistol . I let the ANGEL smoothly guide it to center mass ( it took over fine motor control after a Resurrection ) and watched as it gently squeezed the trigger . My murder began smoking all over instantly , and then there was a luminous flash as his clothing and skin exploded off of him . As the mind numbing epinephrine high wore off I heard LJ running up behind me , shouting into her radio for backup and two ambulances , one to make sure I was stabilized and one just to make it look like we 'd tried to save the smoking skinless asshole who thought he 'd get away with killing a cop . <newline> <newline> I need a drink .

1,"I 've always wanted to write an alt-history WW1 story , so here goes . <newline> _________________________________________________________________________________________ <newline> The War Without End <newline> _________________________________________________________________________________________ <newline> Okay , since I wo n't get much of a chance to flesh out the universe from the perspective of the boots on the ground I 'll do it here . WW1 did n't end in 1918 , it instead dragged on and on , by the time the story takes place it 's 1965 . <newline> _________________________________________________________________________________________ <newline> Russ Russ pulled back the bolt on his door gunner 's Vickers , slamming a new round into the chamber . The other door gunner stepped away from his position to shovel more coal into the engine of the Doran Attack Craft 56 . The sound of the blade spinning over their heads was almost tolerable if they closed the side doors , but they needed to deploy soldiers fairly fast and be able to rain .303 on any Germans below . The pilot shouted through the small door frame to the cockpit <newline> <newline> `` Oi ! Load them Vickers , we have Jerries in the field . We 're to clear a path for the Canadian shock troops so they can punch through to the Russian border ! '' <newline> <newline> The Canadians , Russ had seen them fight in the trenches . They were brutal , but efficient . Russ opened fire on the field below , firing on anyone in a grey uniform . There were n't very many of them , which was surprising considering those Jerries were guarding the Russian border . Most of Russ ' shots missed their targets , but the threat of a .303 British cartridge tearing one open from above was enough to make the Germans that did n't run hit the dirt . The DAC56 swerved back toward the enemy forces for another attack run , he could see the Canadians below . They were tearing the Prussian infantry to pieces . A round that must have been fired from an anti tank rifle slammed into the other gunners chest , he fell to the floor , a fist sized hole bored through his chest and back . In the battleground below Russ saw movement in the treeline and thicker vegetation in the fields . Hundreds of men swarmed from the treeline , hitting the Canadians in their flanks . They had led their shocktroopers into a trap to keep aid from reaching the Tsar 's men in the East . The Canadians were caught between three forces of Germans hitting them from the front and sides and were slaughtered to the last man by surprise , blunt force , and firepower in general . The DAC56 squadron pulled out , heading back toward British lines bearing news of the terrible defeat . The DAC touched down at the Innsmouth outpost in the heart of France , it was one of the few parts of mainland Europe they controlled with Spain declaring for the Central Powers and Belgium being a smoldering wasteland from Austro-Hungarian scorched earth campaigns in the 50s . The ANZACs had lost the Sinai campaign and were pulled into Europe to aid in the failing British and French offensives . This unwittingly gave the Ottoman Turks a chance to strike the Russians from the South with the Germans and Austro-Hungarians pummeling Western Russia . Russ stepped out of the DAC56 and onto the ground , he grabbed the nearest runner and shouted in his face over the still very alive engines <newline> “ Listen ! Tell the Brass the Russian offensive *failed* ! ” The runner , a young man that had barely seen twenty years nodded after jotting what he said on a notepad . *Brass ’ ll have someone ’ s head over* this Russ thought , pulling his goggles up on to his hat . But it was not his problem , the COs that led the Canadians in there with poor intelligence would be hanged or shot . The war had been going for almost fifty years , but the Central Powers were gaining ground too fast for the Entente to keep up with them . Failed offensives were becoming regular , the Entente were crippled when the Germans invaded Switzerland and seized all of the money stored by governments to distribute among their allies . He sat down on a bench and wiped the sweat of his brow . If the war continued like this , the sun would finally set on the British empire . <newline> ______________________________________________________________ <newline> How did I do ? Should I continue Russ ' story or shoot it behind the barn ?

1,"I asked my friends for prompts when I was bored , my friend was being a smart ass and requested `` Write a story about a man who wakes up with no butthole . Make it a tense thriller . '' This was the result . <newline> <newline> **The Man With No Butthole** <newline> <newline> The first thing he noticed was the ache in his stomach . It was an unusual feeling , not the typical constipation he was used to , this felt deeper . He opened his eyes to the dark room around him , his bedroom , empty like always . His bachelor life was beginning to catch up to him and this ache in his intestines was another reminder . He was hungover , like most days of the week . <newline> <newline> He stood up and stretched which caused the ache to triple in intensity , this was new , he thought . Walking to the bathroom he caught a quick glimpse of himself in the mirror . His hair was a mess , he had n't shaved in months , and his eyes were bloodshot red . What the fuck happened last night ? <newline> <newline> The toilet seat was cold as he lowered his already naked body on to it . Preparing himself for the first of what he expected to be a morning of hangover shits , he began the process ... and immediately began screaming . <newline> <newline> The pain was incredible . The pressure on his abdomen pierced him like a thousand knives , but nothing came out . He had been constipated before , but this was different . He panicked , throwing himself off the toilet and onto the cold tile floor . It felt almost refreshing , but as his hands found their way to his butt cheeks , he discovered something he never could have predicted . His asshole was completely gone . <newline> <newline> His mind was racing , the panic setting in worse and worse as the pain became worse and worse . As he thought it had reached its peak , he heard the door bell ring . Struggling to get up , he threw on his discarded boxers and lurched to the door . As he opened it , his best friend Justin rushed through the door . <newline> <newline> `` Chris , are you alright bro ? Do you remember what happened last night ? '' Justin sounded frantic , like something horrible had happened . <newline> <newline> `` N ... no . I do n't . '' The words forced themselves out through gritted teeth . Chris ' stomach began to grumble , feeling as though his insides were rearranging themselves . <newline> <newline> `` You left with some girl , man , but I had a really bad feeling about her . Something was wrong with her , she barely spoke , and she just seemed ... fucked up , I guess . '' Justin sat down on the foot of the bed and ran his hands through his hair . He seemed nervous , there was something he was n't telling Chris . <newline> <newline> `` Is she here ? '' He asked Chris , suddenly sounding more nervous than panicked . <newline> <newline> `` No , it 's just me . '' Chris laid down back on the bed , he felt as though his stomach would burst at any moment . <newline> <newline> `` Okay , good , because there 's something I need to tell you . You 've heard about those weird murders going around right ? They say it 's some weird ritualistic thing , their innards basically strewn across whatever room they were in . The thing is , someone claims to have seen the woman that did it . The girl you left with , bro , it was her I 'm almost positive . I know it 's strange , I mean the murders probably being exaggerated anyway . '' Justin laughed and smacked Chris on his bare stomach . <newline> <newline> `` They say all the victims had no butthole . '' As if right on cue , Chris screamed as his stomach tore open . Justin threw himself on the floor , his eyes shot wide in terror . There on the bed , some form of insect larva he 'd never seen before were writhing through the intestines of his now dead best friend . <newline> <newline> Justin would later recount this story a hundred times , and each time he would say the same thing . <newline> <newline> They had her face .

1,"- My Joy - <newline> <newline> <newline> June . <newline> <newline> <newline> The sun had just began to set and her hair fell softly on her face , just barely covering the soft smile that had spread across her lips . The golden strands of light dancing on her jade green eyes had me in a trance . We laid under the tall oak tree laughing , sharing , enjoying each other . I would n't trade that memory for anything . I only met this girl a few short weeks ago but I have never felt anything close to the connection we share . Her laugh is infectious . Her touch is a high unlike any other . I am falling hard . <newline> <newline> <newline> July . <newline> <newline> <newline> The summer burned as hot as our romance , practically every free waking moment spent either with each other or thinking about each other ; each night my dreams were flush with her bright persona . The littlest moments meant the most . The way she ran her thumb against my hand as she held it close , the way her eyes would light up when we played one of her favorite songs , and the indescribable energy she carried with her at all times . I am totally , deeply , crazy for this girl . <newline> <newline> August . <newline> <newline> <newline> My favorite way to describe August is that it feels like a month long Sunday . You are technically still off from work or school but it 's presence looms over you like a big grey cloud . There 's a funny saying about love , that goes `` love is blind '' . Many interpret that to mean that looks do n't mean as much when you love their soul . Another way to interpret it is that love blinds you to your surroundings , you do n't think . As the return to our respective college campuses crept closer and closer the fog over my eyes began to clear and the reality of my love set in . <newline> <newline> August 28th . Well , the 27th to be more realistic . August 27th was the day we were both leaving to go back , the 28th we would move in , and I had no idea what the 29th would bring . The final weeks grew more and more overshadowed by the approaching exodus . I could tell by the way her grip on my hand was more loose than in recent months , and how her gaze was no longer just one of love but also longing . As if I had left already . <newline> <newline> We sat in a small coffee shop , for the first time in our relationship we actually had a problem . Our fears poured out and we instantly felt better knowing that the other knew where our heads were at . That was the last day I felt like she was truly mine . Truly with me , truly my joy . <newline> <newline> <newline> August 26th . <newline> <newline> <newline> We agreed to give it a shot . As I sat in the driver 's seat staring at the girl I knew in my heart that I loved , my head was drowning in thought . We spent as much time as we could , but we may as well have not been together at all . Our heads elsewhere , our hearts bracing for what is to come . I embraced her one last time before I go , I still do not know if it was the last time I will ever have the privilege . We said our goodbyes , and went our separate ways . <newline> <newline> No high could numb the pain . Nothing compares to the pain of watching her drive off , to realizing you wo n't be able to see her for at least a month . But most of all , nothing compares to the pain of a phone call six days later where she calmly tells you that she does n't think that she can do it . Now as I sit on a dirty futon in a dorm room surrounded by textbooks and assorted belongings I would throw it all away to have her back in my arms . But that simply is n't possible right now . Maybe some day we will sit across from each other again , with new fire in our hearts and love in our gaze , but that day is not any day soon .

1,"I 've been bullied , all my life . There 's not a lot more to say than that . I 've had my lunch bag filled with sand on the school trip to the beach . I 've had my jacket torn up because I had the audacity to wear it . I 've had my teeth kicked out because I did n't give up my lunch money . I 've been locked in the office over the weekend because , I do n't know , I was there , I guess . <newline> <newline> *That 's not what the question was about , sir* <newline> <newline> I 'm getting to it , I need you to understand where I was coming from before today . This morning , I was nearly run over by one of my coworkers on the parking lot , as a joke , but I would have ended up in the hospital if I had n't jumped into a puddle . <newline> <newline> <newline> *Sir , we need to know what happened in there* <newline> <newline> I was getting coffee before I went home . I was supposed to redo the Pfizer proposals tonight so I was going to have to work through the night ... <newline> <newline> *I 'm going to ask again , sir . What happened in there ? * <newline> <newline> Alright . So I was waiting in line to get coffee when that guy walked in . I was second in line to order , and he just cut right in front of me . Treated me like I was n't there . I tried to say something but he just looked at me and turned back around . I decided I was n't going to bother him because he looked angry . It was n't going to be worth any trouble , so I just waited . The lady behind me called me a pussy . <newline> <newline> *That guy , you mean the person still in there ? * <newline> <newline> Yes . So when it got to his turn , he bent over the counter and kind of whispered something to the barista . I did n't hear what he said but she started putting the money in the register in a bag . I assumed they were getting robbed . <newline> <newline> *Okay , then what happened ? * <newline> <newline> I did n't do anything , really . The lady behind me got impatient I guess ? She nudged my arm and it hit the guy . He then turned around and pulled out a revolver from his waistband . He then put the revolver barrel in my mouth and told me to get on my knees . He talked for a bit , mostly about my masculinity and my appearance , until he removed the revolver from my mouth to take the bag from the cashier . And then I guess I just.. snapped . <newline> <newline> *You snapped ? What did you do exactly ? * <newline> <newline> I ... I pulled the revolver from his hand as he was turning around , jabbed two fingers in his eyes and smacked him on the side of the head with the butt of the gun . I saw this in a movie . Then when he was on the floor , I put a knee on his wrist and leant over him , I saw this on a crime show . And I grabbed him in the crotch , I saw this on another movie . And then I talked to him . <newline> <newline> *You talked to him ? What did you say ? * <newline> <newline> I said , I was going to punch his chest until his lungs collapsed so I could watch him suffocate . Then I said , before he passed out , I was going to rip his balls of and stuff them down his mouth . I also said , I had enough and the only way he was going to walk out of here was for him to apologise to me . <newline> <newline> *And then what happened ? * <newline> <newline> He called me a pussy . And I did everything I said I would do . <newline> <newline> *Okay , sir , I 'm going to ask you to come with me to the police station . * <newline> <newline> Yes , yes that would be best , I think . Thank you .

1,"** ( Works better if you think of this as an opener/introduction rather than a standalone story . ) ** <newline> <newline> I pushed the throttle harder , even though I knew the ship was already well over its maximum speed . *This is n't fast enough , * I thought . *They 'll find me before I can find a planet . * <newline> <newline> Uncertainty raced through my mind . I started repeating the arguments I had had with myself many times over the past weeks . <newline> <newline> *I should have used a void portal , instead of this old piece of junk . I could be on the other side of the galaxy right now . * <newline> <newline> *No , you idiot , those are traceable . And they ca n't be closed from the other side . They 'd be on you in seconds . * <newline> <newline> *Well , then , I should have gone back to Earth . * <newline> <newline> *That would be so stupid . That 's the first place they 'd look ! They 'd find you there , and then there would be trouble . Serious trouble . * <newline> <newline> *At least I would be there to save them ! * <newline> <newline> *Do n't play the hero like that . You could n't save them , and you know it . The planet would be devastated . * <newline> <newline> *Well then , I should n't even be trying ! No one 's EVER escaped the Covenant and lived ! * <newline> <newline> *And you can be the first . Even if you ca n't , better to die than live as a puppet and a monster . * <newline> <newline> *Even if I do escape ... what do I do next ? * <newline> <newline> * ... ... ... * <newline> <newline> I was so lost in thought that I almost did n't notice the planet showing up as a blip on the radar screen . An *uncontrolled* planet . That was n't supposed to be possible . The Covenant had a stranglehold on the galaxy , especially this close to their hub . Every planet within a thousand light-years was supposed to be theirs . And here was one they had n't touched . This was too good to be true . <newline> <newline> The thought briefly crossed my mind that the planet was a Covenant trap , but I dismissed that . They would n't need a trap . No one had tried to escape in a thousand years -- it was blatant suicide . Once you 're in , you 're in for life . That 's the deal . <newline> <newline> I aimed the ship at the planet . Pushed harder on the throttle , again forgetting that the ship was already far beyond its maximum speed . <newline> <newline> My mind flew to the most important part of the escape . What everything , including my life -- no , ESPECIALLY my life , hinged on . <newline> <newline> *You have n't got enough stored energy to survive this ! * <newline> <newline> *Better to die than to live as a puppet and a monster . * <newline> <newline> The ship approached the planet at blistering speeds . I pushed ever harder on the throttle . At this point , I did n't even care that the ship was far beyond its maximum speed . <newline> <newline> *Better to die than to live as a puppet and a monster . * <newline> <newline> The ship entered the planet 's upper atmosphere . It would be only a few seconds now . <newline> <newline> *Better to die than to live as a puppet and a monster . * <newline> <newline> I took all of the energy I had stored over the past weeks and shaped it into a shield for myself . <newline> <newline> *Better to die than to live as a puppet and a monster . * <newline> <newline> The planet 's surface entered my view . I shut my eyes tightly , not wanting to see the inevitable . <newline> <newline> <newline> *Better to die ... * <newline> <newline> *I 'm not dying , you idiot . They 'll just THINK that I did . * <newline> <newline> *But ... what then ? * <newline> <newline> * ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..* <newline> <newline> I heard an unfathomably loud crash ... and then silence .

1,"The start . <newline> <newline> The pizza box lay open on the glass coffee table , two and a half pieces left uneaten while the TV continues its usual droning of infomercials and QVC in the ungodly hour that is the now . The night is still present , but largely forgotten as the sky has a purple hue and the birds awake and welcome their offspring to the new day . The man lay there on the couch , one leg on , and the other off , with the knit throw blanket covering enough of him to make sure his deep sleep is accompanied by a slight glimpse of warmth . His unkempt hair wild like his persona , but calm as his current state . Too many times has he fallen asleep here and usually it 's for the same reason as this one : a fight ending not in agreement , but in tears . He knows she ’ ll wake and he ’ ll hear her and walk into the room , apologize , cry and hug her as the rubber band that is their love is stretch further and further to the point of snapping . The man looks at the channel on the television and spots the time : 7:32 am . For a Saturday , she should be up . She usually wakes up at about 7:00- at least that 's what her alarm clock is set for . Maybe she woke up and turned it off . Perhaps she needed more time to think about the night before . Regardless , the man dozes off again . In the place of dreams , the man finds himself at peace without memory of a fight and in retrospect without memory of the lover . The peace ended and he opened his benevolent green eyes slowly , his phalanges still tingling from his REM stage . He looked over again at the television ; this time the news is on . Odd considering it does n't come on until 9 . 10:07 in the morning . Still nothing . No noise . No love . The air felt cool . He arose from the couch and the cracks of his knees were warmly welcomed by the noise of the newscaster . He walked to the bedroom , in the back of his head predicting what would be , or not be , there . His fears were confirmed when he entered a clean room with a made bed with nothing but his items . He knew this was coming , but it did n't prepare him . He did n't remember beginning to cry , but could feel the tears streaming down his cheeks . He felt the carpet meet his knees and his heart and inside feel a craving- a yearning for her . He was empty . He climbed on top the bed , only to hear a crinkle . A note lay under him and he reached under his back to obtain it : <newline> <newline> “ I love you . I never felt like the love would end , but it has . The emptiness I have felt has been something unknown to me in the years prior . We have grown apart . You have matured , you want to settle down and spend the nights together in the house with a glass of water- I would like to attend a party and enjoy a glass of scotch with you . We are different people . We have grown older . We are not the people we fell in love with. ” <newline> <newline> The paper covered in tears , he clung to its first three words . He knew there was still a chance . He knew she had to feel something still . But what he knew that she did not know is that when they fell in love the man hid alcohol in places around his house and could n't be the spontaneous person he was without a drink prior . She did n't know the man sought religion and found it and practiced by himself . He tried to hide these things for the same reason that they split , but could n't . They were done . He was free to be himself . He knew this was for her , but it was for him . <newline>

1,"Different People <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> `` Is he asleep ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , '' she said . <newline> <newline> `` He 's a heavy sleeper . '' She peeked into the crib , before pulling her head back up . `` I sometimes worry that he 's not breathing . I 'll pull up a chair and look at him for hours , just watching his chest rise and fall . '' <newline> <newline> I glanced over to the little figure . He was so small . `` The time between breaths must be scary . '' <newline> <newline> She nodded . `` It feels like forever . I panic . I immediately think that I 'm a terrible mother and that no one else has ever screwed up being a mother until I came along . '' <newline> <newline> I shrugged . `` You would n't be the first . '' <newline> <newline> She tiptoed around the room , arranging and organizing and cleaning things . She was always messy -- it did n't seem like parenthood had changed her in that regard all that much . <newline> <newline> `` Did I show you the painting I 'm working on ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' <newline> <newline> `` Come here , '' she said , as she led me by the hand . I repressed the reaction to flinch , ignoring the electricity that I felt start at my fingertips and end in my shoulders . <newline> <newline> In her too-small kitchen was a canvas , half-complete . I did n't know what I was looking at . <newline> <newline> `` Well ? '' she said . <newline> <newline> `` It 's not done . '' <newline> <newline> She sighed . `` I know that . How does it make you feel ? '' <newline> <newline> I squinted at the canvas , trying to see if I could derive deeper meaning from it . A family playing in the grass , a couple holding hands , a lonely man -- what was it ? <newline> <newline> `` It 's kind of like , '' I started , wanting to be careful with how I worded things , `` a song that you kind of know , but it stops before it gets to that part that you know how to sing . '' I immediately cringed . Terrible choice of words . <newline> <newline> `` I hate that , '' she said with a laugh . `` It sounds like I have a little more work to do , then . '' <newline> <newline> She picked up a brush and her palette . `` If you 're wondering , the answer is yes , '' she said , almost off-hand . `` It does feel different . '' <newline> <newline> `` Being a mother ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Being a lot of different things . '' <newline> <newline> `` Like what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Being older . '' <newline> <newline> `` 32 is n't old . '' <newline> <newline> `` But it 's not 21 . 21 is Tinder and driving in cars with boys and road trips with the girls and studying until 2 am . '' <newline> <newline> `` And what 's 32 ? '' <newline> <newline> She pursed her lips into a smile . `` 32 is being an entirely different thing . '' <newline> <newline> She started painting in the blank parts of the canvas , as if she knew exactly what needed to be where , without second guessing or pre-planning or sketching . <newline> <newline> `` 32 is , '' she continued , `` is laughing at old diaries , taking multivitamins every morning , and compromising when I do n't agree with my husband . You just kind of know things that you did n't when you were younger . '' <newline> <newline> `` Like what will happen tomorrow ? '' I offered helpfully . <newline> <newline> `` I think when you get to be where I am , '' she said , looking over my shoulder to where her baby was sleeping in the living room , `` you do n't worry about tomorrow as much .

1,"Quick Prelude : I 'm a young writer ( high school age ) , and I 've been taking an awesome writing workshop for the past three summers . This year in the workshop , one of the classes was on subtext in writing . We drew prompts out of a hat and got to work . Mine was : `` Your character 's spouse has cheated on them and they do n't know how to handle it . '' <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> When I swerve into the driveway and the tires squeal like children on a rollercoaster , I take out the mailbox ; the pretty one with the floral pattern and lime green paint and our last name on it . Oh . Woops . I leave the car in it ’ s jagged position on the driveway and push the door shut . I don ’ t give it much effort so it doesn ’ t slam shut so much as it lightly clicks into place . <newline> <newline> I walk through the door and the house smells of sex and lies . Makes me wish my tie was a noose . I undo the knot and let the tie fall to my side . As I trek my way through the foyer and up the stairs I pull my shirt out of my waistband and undo the buttons . At the top of the steps I kick off my shoes and toss my belt away . <newline> <newline> It ’ s like laying on a bed of nails , ya know ? You expect it too hurt a lot but it ’ s really only numb . <newline> <newline> I walk down the hall into the nursery . I hear her voice call my name in the kind of voice that indicates repetition . Oh . I didn ’ t realize she was home . <newline> <newline> Little Ben is sound asleep . The radio hums its melodies in the background . Ben only can fall asleep with music . I look into the crib for a moment and feel a frog take residency in my throat and I sigh . I pick up Ben , wrapped in a blanket and wearing a soft blue hat , and rock the little bundle against my chest . <newline> <newline> “ Mommy and Daddy sitting in a tree , ” I sing under my breath with an absent mind . “ K-I-S-S-I-N-G. ” <newline> <newline> And then Ben opens his eyes with the big baby blue irises that ’ ll make the girls go crazy when he ’ s older . With a sudden shock I ’ m reminded of what my own mother had said last week when she came to visit . <newline> <newline> “ God , he sure looks an awful lot like Jimmy , doesn ’ t he ? ” <newline> <newline> Yes mother . He does look like Jimmy . <newline> <newline> I put Ben down . Walk downstairs . My walk is accompanied by a soundtrack of white noise . She ’ s in the kitchen and she gives me a funny look when I stumble in like a drunk blind man . <newline> <newline> “ Guess what Jimmy told me at the office today , ” I say . <newline> <newline> What I see in her eyes after I say that really kills me . Et tu , Brute . <newline> <newline> “ He feels really bad , Jimmy does , ” I continue . “ ’ You got to know ’ is what he said to me . You got to know . He just feels awful , so , so awful. ” <newline> <newline> She says my name but I ’ ve already turned and walked out the door without my shoes . The Oldsmobile calls my name louder than she does . The night sky is caught between that beautiful limbo of dusk and evening when the colors above are vibrant oranges , yellows , reds , and purples . It looks like a fresh watercolor . The air nips but only with gentle love bites . I smile in spite of things . <newline> <newline> Nice night for a drive . <newline>

1,"An Ice-water in Hell <newline> <newline> The sweetness touched his tongue , and immediately his throat opened up and slammed the rest of the drink . <newline> <newline> “ Fuck ! ” He exclaimed , flipping the paper cup over the bar . “ That was good . What ’ s in it ? ” <newline> <newline> The bartender shrugged , as always . “ Water . Sugar . Lemons. ” <newline> <newline> “ You can ’ t even taste the alcohol , man. ” <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s because there is none. ” <newline> <newline> There was a moment where he did not speak , running his tongue over his lips while the dull beat of the dance floor bled over their silence . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ll take another. ” <newline> <newline> The bartender shrugged again , ever the incarnation of apathy , and poured him a second cup . “ On the house. ” <newline> He grabbed the paper cup and sauntered off , taking a sip . What a novel thing , drinking something that wasn ’ t supposed to fuck you up . Although , he supposed , it was bound to do something to his brain in it ’ s own way . <newline> <newline> He passed a couple who looked as if they were trying to get their tongues stuck in the other ’ s throat , a violent display with no tenderness . He idly wondered if they knew each other ’ s names . <newline> <newline> As he squeezed past them , the chick ’ s hand reached out and lightly caressed his chest . He snorted and wiped it away with a flick . <newline> <newline> He took another sip . <newline> <newline> The archway onto the dancefloor stretched tall , long and thin and hard to see , and as he penetrated the doorway he said to himself , “ Pain and Pleasure , ” but no one heard him , the music had grown much too loud , a booming piece of trash that was as ephemeral and empty as the shit he took in order to dance to it . In time with the drums , lights flashed from red to blue to green back to red again , and for the first time he found himself looking at the faces of those he would dance with . <newline> <newline> The flicking lights on their faces froze them briefly in snapshots ; distorted , glazed , the blank mask of exotic agony and terrible exhilaration . The lost were all but fucking on the floor . <newline> <newline> Behold , they have become sex , destroyer of lives . Willing to use whatever and whoever is at hand to briefly , brutally briefly , forget the spiral that they have become around the gutter . <newline> <newline> He took another sip . <newline> <newline> He saw that the alley door was open , another novel experience for him . It was almost always shut . To his surprise , he saw that daylight streamed through the door -- the bright , blinding light of the midday sun . Too long had he been in here , his eyes couldn ’ t even adjust a little against the sting . For a moment , he thought that if he left , it ’ d be okay . It ’ d be fine . <newline> <newline> He took another sip . <newline> <newline> He headed back towards the bar . <newline> <newline> He slapped his hand on the counter . <newline> <newline> He asked , “ Do you have rum and coke ? ” <newline> <newline> The bartender ’ s lips played in a slight smile . “ You know that we do. ” <newline> <newline> He would have been fine . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ll take one. ” <newline> <newline> “ On the house. ” <newline> <newline> As the drink was being made , he brought the non-alcohol to his lips , pausing for a second . <newline> <newline> With a shrug , he finished his drink . <newline>

1,"Waves pure as crystal licked at the edge of the wooden hull , rhythmically sloshing against the ancient battered planks and rusted nails holding them together . Her name was 'The Beacon ' and she was the finest ship in the Coalition of Mankind . Slicing through the choppy waters , The Beacon was the only source of light throughout a vast sea of darkness. , living up to her name . <newline> <newline> Within the lower chambers of the ship , Captain Thaddius gazed over his long-worn map . They were heading West to the port of Melitas , delivering supplies to the forces resisting the Sha'kizhar rebellion . He heard the startled cries of the crew as harsh winds caught the ship from starboard , quickly remedied by the Navigational Officer bellowing commands for the men on deck to return The Beacon back to her intended course . <newline> <newline> *Finest crew in the Coalition my ass . At this rate we 're going to be blown off course and lose an entire day . I swear to Jericho , if Melitas is taken because this crew ca n't fucking sail like sober men , I will sink this damned ship and everyone on it , including myself . * Thought Captain Thaddius as his mind wandered , contemplating if the measly food and munition resupplies would be enough to hold Melitas . However , his thoughts were abruptly cut off as a deck mate began slamming his fist upon the Captain 's door like a madman . <newline> <newline> `` CAPTAIN ! THE SEACASTER SAID HE DETECT 'D SOMETHIN ' ! HE WANTS YOU ON DECK RIGHT NOW ! URGENT , HE SAID ! '' The deck mate 's breaths were ragged and swift , as if he had sprinted right down to the Captain 's Quarters . Pushing past the winded deck mate , Captain Thaddius purposefully marched up the steps to the main deck , each boot striking the wood , thumps reverberating throughout the staircase . As he arrived to the deck , the Grand Seacaster rushed to him . <newline> <newline> `` Captain Thaddius . I am sorry to interrupt your time , but I have detected several *things* in the water . I have no knowledge of what they are , but they are larger than a man and moving incredibly quickly , towards ***us*** from the West ! '' Captain Thaddius saw it in the Seacaster 's eyes . Though he was collected and prepared , as any man of The Beacon would be , he knew danger was in the water . This was all the confirmation The Captain needed ; ** '' ARM FOR COMBAT ! ENEMIES INCOMING AT THE BOW ! RAISE CANNONS AND SET HARPOONS ! SEACASTER , GET TO YOUR MAGE TOWER ! `` ** Fierocity in the Captain 's voice , he readied the ship for war . <newline> <newline> Stepping out upon the edge of the bow , The Captain looked into the shadowed night-time sea . Through the veiled darkness , he could make out four shapes , skimming through the water at a pace no ship could match . As they came closer , he could discern humanoid figures riding the creatures of the water . Dread engulfed The Captain 's entire body , as panic started to rise through his gut , and into his spine . Only legends have been told of these , for the only sailors to encounter them rest at the ocean floor . The Captain had never felt fear on The Beacon until now . *Creator and Ascendants protect me , * The Captain thought- *for we are all fated to Death . It 's the Elven Tide-Hunters . * <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> This is all I really have for now . I have a massive world planned out , but have no idea how and where to start , and which story to tell . Constructive criticism is welcomed and appreciated . Do n't be afraid to be harsh . Thanks ! : )

1,"It has been six weeks and the sounds will not leave . They came to me first in a dream , only when I woke , they did n't go away . They have been getting louder as well , rising from a faint echo into the beating drum that is tearing me apart . The doctor thought it could be a form of tinnitus but I could tell he was grasping at straws . What I did n't tell the doctor about was the voice . He first whispered to me the day after the noise appeared , at first I was n't even sure I had heard anything . Then it came again , loud and clear . `` Help me '' that is all it would say , help me , over and over again . <newline> <newline> As the doctor could do nothing for me and life must go on I attempted to reassemble myself back into the usual routine of life . Just now with the constant companion of unwanted chaos beating down my senses day by day , and the voice that would never go away . You do n't realize what a gift silence can be until it is denied to you . Alcohol quickly join the social circle of myself and my voice , in many ways their respective noises cancelled each other out leaving me in an unwitting stupor I was happy to indulge . <newline> <newline> It was on a Saturday night that something finally gave . I was out at the bar socializing with my two new friends when one of them spoke up with an unusual vigor A crescendo of noise that released into a scream in my skull `` *HELP ME* '' . Surely someone must have heard that , I glanced about to see who may have been made aware and sure enough there was one . A man relatively nondescript , the kind you glance at and dismiss just as quickly . The only issue with that was he was looking directly at me . What was I to do ? I glanced away , not meeting his eyes . It was n't as if I could ask him if he could hear the voice in my head , what might he think of me . Still , as he left the bar I felt compelled to follow him , maybe in the relative solitude of the roadside something would be made clearer . When I emerged outside it seemed a world away from the realm of chaos I had just left . It became clear the the man was waiting for me . He beckoned me over with a gesture , his visage shrouded by the smoke coming from a cigarette he had lit . Finally , I thought , I 'm getting somewhere , hopefully this man had some answers I desperately needed . I gathered myself for the truths to come and walked to his side , `` So , uh- '' <newline> <newline> `` do n't '' He said abruptly , `` In fact , fuck off , I do n't need you meddling in this business '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? '' I tired to reply but he was already walking across the street . I hear a noise behind me and glanced away it was at this moment that I was once again gifted with the sweet rush of silence , sweet relief . I turned back to the road and the man was gone . No , wait , there he was , lying face down in a quickly spreading pool of blood . I rushed to his side , as I reached him I saw his chest rising faintly , I knelt down close enough to make out two final word before the last of his breath rattled out of him . `` Help me '' . I was frozen . I sat there replaying the scene in my head , when I became aware of a faint noise and a voice `` You 're next ''

But as always his temper got the <newline> 'best ' of him . <newline> When I heard about this luck , I thought , It ca n't just be for them , surely it 's applicable to anyone . <newline> Even me . <newline>

1,"The ground stank of garbage and the various chamberpots that had been emptied into the alley . Furtive movement bespoke vermin searching for food and I could hear the screech of their claws . I had n't eaten in three days . When had I last had something to drink ? Crawling toward the mouth of the alley I flinched as something skittered across my foot . <newline> <newline> I had n't always been this way . No , once I 'd lived in a castle , been a young lord . That was before . Before the Duke led a rebellion against the King . Before he 'd murdered my father . <newline> Escape had n't been a blessing , only a burden . I should 've just let them kill me , take off my head like they 'd done with father . Then at least the end would have been swift . <newline> <newline> The street beyond was bright and people laughed and talked oblivious , as I had been , to the pain and suffering only feet away . I watched them go , too weak to move anymore . My body ached and my stomach gurgled , begging for food . I flinched back as a troop of guards in gleaming gold etched breastplates trotted past . They did n't see me . I laughed hoarsely . Even if they had , they would n't know me as the Prince . Shoving myself up I stumbled into the street , toward the town gate . <newline> <newline> People avoided me , some ladies lifting handkerchiefs or fans to their faces . I sneered . Days ago they would have been begging me for a favor , for a glance . Now , I was vermin . I struggled , my body protesting movement , demanding food . I tripped and fell sprawled in the dirt before the gate . Soldiers nearby laughed . I fought the urge to glare at them as I pushed myself up and stumbled out into the grass on the other side . <newline> <newline> Out of the dust and press of people I collapsed beside the edge of a field , bordered on its other side by the wood . I looked at the dark wood , its shadows reaching toward me across the field . I rolled my head looking back to what had once been my castle on the hill . The banner of Duke Tricos flew there now , the gold stitch visible in the bright noon light . Rolling over I stumbled toward the dark forest . <newline> <newline> The wave of cool moist air swallowed me up as I stepped into the shadows . Even just beyond the edges all the sounds of the town faded . Here the sounds were different and without a horse beneath me and a bow in hand they were more sinister . Scrambling deeper still I found a bush covered in half-ripened Milkwort berries , bitter but not poisonous and they were food . I gathered them into a pouch formed from the front of my shirt and tied it in a knot before scrambling under the uncovered roots of a nearby Skeleton tree . Leaning against dirt that supported the trunk I ate the berries slowly . Too fast and I 'd be sick . Garil had always warned of that when he 'd trained me . Go without food or water and you needed to be careful when next you had them . <newline> <newline> The berries were awful , but eased the ache in my stomach and the juice , even bitter , was a welcome moisture . Something moved beyond my tree and I froze . Carefully I peeked around the roots . In the berry bushes before me sat a huge Brecar . It 's claws were wrapped around the berry branches , pulling them to its mouth as it ate . I stared , frozen . <newline> I would be dinner if it found me .

1,"I 'm a bit late , but whatev . This is a short piece I wrote that , if I ever find the motivation , I 'd like to expand . <newline> <newline> Girl in the Tower <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> “ Come out and show yourself , Rei ’ jan ! ” he yelled , waving his lance high at the castle tower . “ I am Sir Hallorun , and I come to save the lady Erika from your ruthless grasp ! With the authority of the king behind me- ” <newline> <newline> “ -and the blessings of the gods above , ” Erika continued with an eyeroll , “ I fear no dragon . Same templated speech as all the knights . We ’ re not starting the week with husband material , RJ. ” <newline> <newline> “ Hey , he did add ‘ ruthless ’ , ” Rei ’ jan murmured , trying to keep his booming voice from echoing throughout the forest . <newline> <newline> “ And I bet he was super proud of it too , ” she said as she walked to a small window and peeked out for a moment . “ Hm . He doesn ’ t look too bad though . Wan na see for yourself ? ” <newline> <newline> Rei ’ jan rolled out of his improvised nest and onto his feet with a thud . A plate on Erika ’ s side of the room fell off its table , shattering . <newline> <newline> “ Careful now ! ” Erika said . <newline> <newline> “ Just be grateful I didn ’ t break your dresser this time. ” He crept over to the window and stuck one eye out . “ I thought you didn ’ t like big , scraggly beards. ” <newline> <newline> “ Depends , ” she said . “ If it ’ s an ‘ I ’ ve survived in the wilderness for three weeks ’ kind of beard , I ’ m all for it . If it ’ s just ‘ I never learned how to trim a beard properly , ’ then no , that ’ s gross. ” <newline> <newline> Hallorun noticed the single , slitted eye framed in the window above . “ Come out , coward ! I wish only for a fair fight ! ” he shouted with a slight quiver . <newline> <newline> Rei ’ jan glanced back at Erika . “ Plug your ears , ” he said . He poked his head out of a hatch in the ceiling and let out a deafening roar , filling the sky with flame . Hallorun ’ s horse reared up , nearly running off on its own ; Hallorun had to drop his lance just to keep the horse restrained . <newline> <newline> Rei ’ jan ’ s head slipped back down . “ Okay , but how am I supposed to know which type of beard he has ? ” <newline> <newline> Erika looked up , quizzically . “ Ask him about it ? ” <newline> <newline> “ In the middle of the whole ‘ intimidation ’ thing ? How am I supposed to pull that off ? ” <newline> <newline> She smirked . “ I thought you were the one with the wisdom of a thousand years. ” <newline> <newline> “ Not in dealing with humans ! ” he said , quietly but punctuated . <newline> <newline> Hallorun recovered control of his horse and lance . “ You think I would run at the first sight of danger ? ” he managed . “ Think again , you overgrown wyrm ! ” <newline> <newline> Rei ’ jan ’ s brow furrowed , and he took a deep , slow breath . “ I have an idea . You are not making this easy for me though , ” he said as he wriggled through the hatch again . This time , he let out a dark , cocky laugh as he studied Hallorun head-on . “ So , ” he said , allowing his voice its full volume . “ Sir Hallorun , you said ? ” <newline> <newline> “ That is I ! I hereby challenge you to- ” <newline> <newline> “ Not that it matters , ” Rei ’ jan interrupted . “ You ’ ll burn just the same as the commoners . I do wonder , though - is the king so desperate he ’ ll grant someone like you knighthood ? Or is he just bad at choosing his knights ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Foul beast ! ” Hallorun yelled . “ An insult against the High King is an insult against me ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Good . And here ’ s another - you look like a mess. ” <newline> <newline> After a brief pause , Hallorun smiled slightly and puffed his chest out . “ I suppose I should not be surprised you would stoop so low , ” he said . “ I admit I am not as well-kept as usual , but I have been traveling for three days and three nights- ” <newline> <newline> “ Burn him , ” Erika said , and a single resounding blast later , he was reduced to ashes .

1,"From a novel I 'm working on called Crosscountry <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> As far as mornings go , Thomas Marcellus Oswiler had a pretty damn good one . When he awoke before his alarm at 7:00 a.m. on Friday the 12th of May , he rolled over and blearily gazed out his window to find his mother ’ s pale blue station wagon absent from it ’ s usual residence next to the shed . Grinning , he rolled back over and slept for another 56 minutes . When he awoke for the second time that morning , he sat up and stretched , a wry , satisfied smile upon his lips . <newline> With a fluid motion , he swung his legs over to the side of the bed and stood , walking over to the carved wooden statue of Jesus his step-mother had gotten him during one of her expeditions to Costa Rica . Each year she trekked out with her Advanced Placement Biology class to study and observe organisms in the rainforests , collect samples , take pictures , and generally just geek out over anything alive . <newline> He placed a hand on the Lord-and-Savior ’ s head . The paint had begun fading a few days after he put it on his bureau . The consistent sunlight had left the front half a unique blend of faded blues , soft reds and nearly undetectable golds . The backside was still in full color . <newline> Thomas grabbed the head with his hand and lifted the figure feet first into the air , revealing a small , rugged hole that looked like it had been carved into the bottom of the Birkenstocks by an inexperienced hand . Without admiring his handiwork , Thomas shook the statue until the pack of cigarettes slid out , then returned the Messiah to his original position . Flipping open the half empty pack , he pulled out a single American Spirit and tucked it behind his ear before carefully returning them to their homey hole . <newline> He then dressed without haste ; lazily pulling on a pair of unwashed jeans he picked up from the floor , along with a shirt that smelled relatively clean . He smirked with satisfaction a second later as he looked back at The Man in Black flipping him the bird back at him in the mirror . He ruffled his shaggy black hair a few times before proceeding downstairs to jerk-off . <newline> Twenty minutes later he slid the sliding glass door behind him , munching on the last crumbs of a Pop Tart . He stopped and pulled the cigarette out , pinching it between his lips . He cupped a hand flicked the flint . Slinging his backpack over his shoulder , he threw his skateboard down and began the fifteen-minute skate to school . He took his time , pushing lackadaisically and enjoying every drag of the cancer stick between his teeth . <newline> As he wound his way through the suburban streets , he took careful note of his surroundings . He noticed Old Man Anderson ’ s trash barrels had been emptied and strewn in the street , their contents flapping in the gentle morning breeze . With a slight shift in his hips , Thomas navigated towards the barrels , the dull grinding of polyurethane against gravel filling his ears . He crouched and ollied low above the first one , grazing it with his wheels , and without stopping , kick-flipped high over the second . He laughed took a drag in triumph . <newline> He saw Mrs. Henderson tending her garden , her daughter Cecelia sitting in the grass nearby . The toddler was poking at something Thomas couldn ’ t see , as it was obscured by the bright green blades , but she seemed to be preoccupied to the utmost of her abilities . He smiled and raised a hand in greeting , the butt of the cigarette still clutched between his index and middle fingers . Mrs. Henderson straightened up and saw him , but did not return the gesture . Shaking his head slightly , he pushed onwards up the street . The dull grind of polyurethane wheels on pavement reverberated in his ears . <newline> He approached the main road , quickly looking both ways before giving two hard pushes and catapulting himself across the four – briefly – empty lanes . He heard the blare of multiple horns over his shoulder as he reached the other sidewalk with a quick ollie up the curb . Without looking back , he grinned and flicked the butt of his cigarette over his shoulder . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> Any and all honest feedback appreciated : )

1,"Sorry if this is n't one of my best . It 's a little old . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> That old saying , that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong , has some truth to it . <newline> <newline> Eighteen-year-old Isabella Powers knew this as well as anyone . She used to be a superheroine , and she was FAST . Like beating-gravity-by-using-your-body-as-an-airfoil fast . She and her two sisters would spend their days defending their beloved city from one danger after another . <newline> <newline> But all that seemed as distant as a previous life now - now that He diverted his attention from them and possessed the body of the man who gave Isabella and her sisters their powers , and forced him to take them away , and the three heroines fled their city and changed their names . <newline> <newline> She wished she could say that she 'd left that old life behind and gone on to make herself a new one , maybe to become a surgeon or a martial artist like her sisters . But she could n't . After they lost their powers , the city soon crumbled beneath Him . After the city , the nation followed , and soon he would have control over the entire world . <newline> <newline> Isabella had been trailing Him in secret every step of the way , always looking for the perfect opportunity to slip under his watchful gaze and strike him down . Her eyesight had slowly become as sharp and her will as hardened as her sisters ' had been , and tonight she saw the perfect opportunity : A depression in the pavement of a parking lot near his parked car . When He came out of the building , she would be waiting to shoot him , and her years of frustration and hatred would finally be over . <newline> <newline> She lay down in the asphalt , exposing as little of herself as possible , drew her pistol , and waited . <newline> <newline> What she did n't count on was the face she 'd have to see before she took the shot . <newline> <newline> He came out and looked directly at her , and she just froze . <newline> <newline> `` Why , is that who I think it is ? '' He called out to her , his voice sickeningly posh and feminine . She could n't bring herself to respond . <newline> <newline> `` My , my , it 's sure been a long time , has n't it ? '' <newline> <newline> All the years of crime-fighting and tragedy to get to Him . <newline> <newline> All the hatred and vengeance she had kept with her every day . <newline> <newline> All the times she had stood by the side of this man and the rest of the city against this very being . <newline> <newline> And now He was here , staring down the barrel of her gun , and she could n't shoot . <newline> <newline> She could n't even speak . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't believe I got a chance to thank you for letting me borrow your old friend all this time , '' He said , chuckling . `` It was so nice of him to take care of you miniscule little girls for me . '' <newline> <newline> Isabella began to weep softly . <newline> <newline> In her mind she had always known it was Him she was following . But as long as He had been in control of that body , there was some part of her that could convince herself that he still existed - that he was still in there somewhere , and someday she 'd find a way to save him and all of this would be worth it . <newline> <newline> But now He had shown his hand , and it was as clear as it could be : This was n't her old friend she was talking to . <newline> <newline> This was Him . <newline> <newline> `` Wh-who are you ... ? '' was all she managed to say , her tears clouding her vision and falling onto the pavement . <newline> <newline> `` Have you forgotten already ? '' He responded with a laugh . `` Just look at me ! I 'm the Professor ! '' <newline> <newline> He paused . `` You know ... '' he continued in long , drawn-out syllables in one last attempt to stall her and change her mind , `` The Professor ? The one who creaaated you ? The one who loooooves you more than anything in the wooooooorld ? '' <newline> <newline> She had always been the intuitive one , and in her mind this voice reeked of the one who took the real Professor from her . <newline> <newline> He hated her as much as she hated him . <newline> <newline> And if there was one thing in her life that she learned , it 's that when someone hates you , they 're not one of your loved ones anymore . <newline> <newline> That was enough for her . She blinked away her tears and tightened her grip on the gun . <newline> <newline> `` No , '' she said , focusing her aim on Him . `` Not anymore . ''

1,"Sleep Paralysis <newline> <newline> A golden-crowned kinglet performs an exclusively curated melody for my listening pleasure as similarly sun-drenched light cascades through my open window , down onto my now fluttering eyelashes , where the dewdrops that formed overnight begin to disperse into the song-heavy air , slow and sure towards the ceiling and beyond to rejoin the clouds from which they came . <newline> <newline> Full stop . Rewind the tape . Eject the cassette . Put it back in the case until later . Remember , you are not dreaming anymore . <newline> <newline> My room is pitch black , and I ’ m sure as hell not sleeping with my window open because it 's colder than satan 's tit outside ; ergo , all the birds have abandoned me to a song-less silence without so much of a closing chirp for someplace and someone warmer . I envision me , a tiny hitchhiker , strapped onto a downy avian back with the wind gusting my red nose raw , but that ’ s a fantasy I can ’ t indulge in until later . I reluctantly inhale reality , but it ’ s like breathing through a straw ; it ’ s sufficient , but my lungs still heave , unsatisfied . <newline> <newline> As if on cue , triggered by my stumbling into a rabbit hole of thoughts not meant for a morning filled with responsibilities and time schedules , the ‘ Drink Me ’ ding of my coffee pot ’ s auto-brew setting simplifies my decision-making process . Looks like another day of partial asphyxiation lies ahead , and the possible consequence of brain damage due to oxygen deprivation is to be dealt with at a later time . In the present , I abruptly snap up into a sitting position , ripping off the delicious haze of sleep like a bandaid . A crumped mass of dingy white sheets and accompanying duvet lay useless at my feet , and I stare at them resentfully , the goosebumps on my bare legs bristling abrasively at their betrayal . I shiver violently , but being nonsentient , the bedcovers do not reply . I don ’ t know why I continue to pick them up every morning , carefully retucking and relayering , when I am fully aware that I will just fight them off as soon as I pass into unconsciousness later in the day . Still , routine is comforting , and also , it ’ s not their fault I ’ m addicted to opiates that cause restless sleep , lucid dreaming , and vivid night terrors . I can ’ t blame a few inanimate objects for the massive problem that is my spiral into this shitty life where the only thing I can look forward to when I wake up in the morning is counting down the hours until I can go back to sleep . I set a timer on my watch and check it obsessively until I can leave my miserable minimum wage job , get onto my rickety old bike , ride home to my mediocre apartment , and swallow the little pink capsules that are my salvation . I check the clock as often as possible and think of their texture : strong but smooth against my teeth and tongue and throat , an intimacy and sensuality any other lover can not provide . <newline> <newline> Enough melodramatics . I stand up . I make the bed . I imbibe an appropriate amount of caffeine and calories . I go to work and perform in a satisfactory manner . I ponder how I have let this robotic efficiency become my waking life . The answer is already waiting , though , as it always is . When your dreams are so vivid , so expansive , so alive , the restraint of consciousness is so suffocating and unappealing that morning sickness almost always accompanies it , except it becomes afternoon sickness , and evening sickness , until the alarm I set goes off and the nausea is swallowed down with the pills . It ’ s like when you ’ re on a road trip to somewhere you really want to go to , but it ’ s really far away and you get really carsick and you ’ re in the back seat and you feel like you ’ re going to throw up for the whole twelve hours , but you endure it anyways because you really , really want to get to where you ’ re going , and you don ’ t even want to pull over to puke because that would make the drive longer , and you really can ’ t wait a second more because you ’ re so excited you feel like you ’ re going to die . <newline> <newline> Like a supernova sun collapsing in on itself , the anticipation fuels and consumes me , and the vastness of the universe , in its celestial benevolence , is kind enough to hide the intensity of my existential paradox ; at some point or another , when I am done destroying myself and all the galaxies within my reach , I will finally burn out to nothingness , forever , and then I can finally not just sleep , but rest , inside the void I have created . Sometimes , I wonder if I ’ ll dream , there , too .

1,"This is from a recent WP I did which got no feedback . It 's the first piece of writing I 've done in over a decade so would be grateful for any constructive criticism . <newline> <newline> The WP itself was `` You 're the lone survivor of the apocalypse . You 've wandered the world for 20 years . And then , one night , you hear someone speaking . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> The crack of a log shifting in the fire startled me out of my doze , hands reaching for weapons I no longer wore , foot knocking over the bottle beside my chair , frantic for the moment it took me to shake off the dream . Millie lifted her head , an eye cracking open in my direction as embers swirled up the chimney behind her . I waved one hand at her as I reached down with the other to catch the bottle as it rolled under my chair . She looked at me for a moment longer then lay back down , her snout turned towards the heat , tail brushing across the floor for a moment as she drifted off again . I clawed at the fragments of the dream for a moment before giving up . What was the point ? Dreams brought nothing but memories now , memories I ’ d rather leave far behind . I stared at the dog for a moment , at the grey on her muzzle . She ’ d be gone soon and I ’ d have to find another , a pup I could steal away from a pack . They wouldn ’ t like it , they never did , but it was something I needed . <newline> The rain had finally stopped , the crackling of the fire and Millie ’ s loud breathing the only sounds to disturb the silence . Peaceful , comforting , in a way dreams could never be , not any more . <newline> I pulled myself out of the chair , neck stiff from being hunched over for too long , leaving the warm light of the fire for the chill dark outside . I couldn ’ t be bothered walking to the outhouse so just stood on the edge of the veranda , pissing into the sodden darkness . The clouds were scudding across the sky , the moon low on the horizon and huge , yellow , casting the yard in greys and revealing the animal pens . One of the pigs was up , snuffling through the mud but everything else was silent , still , the pig ’ s dark shape the only thing moving . <newline> The wind picked up again , shaking water from the trees and pushing the door open behind me . Winter was almost done but it would be cold tomorrow without the clouds . Not wet though , thankfully . It had been raining for days now and I hated it . Everything was damp and the house was getting dirty , no matter how much I tried to avoid tracking mud inside . <newline> Something caught the pig ’ s attention and it stopped moving , fading into the shadows around it as it tested the air . Must be a fox , I thought . The dogs knew to avoid this place now but the damn foxes never learned , always trying for my chickens no matter how many of the bastards I killed . <newline> I heard Millie before I saw her , a low growl as she padded out on to the veranda beside me . She leant against me , the growl vibrating into my thigh as she stared into the night . <newline> “ What is it ? ” I asked , my voice seeming loud even though I whispered . How long had it been since I last said something ? Days ? A week ? Longer ? Did it matter ? I had no need to talk . Millie understood my gestures and it wasn ’ t as though the pigs ever answered back . There was no one else . There hadn ’ t been for a long , long time . And even then , at the end , they weren ’ t people I wanted to talk to , wanted to connect with . Allies , yes . A pack . But friends ? I ’ d been without friends for a long time . <newline> Millie growled louder , with real menace now , and moved forward to the edge of the veranda , ears back and hackles up , standing between me and the darkness . Must be a dog , I thought . She never growled at the foxes , just went for them , tearing into them if she caught one , chasing them into the bush if she didn ’ t and always coming back with a smile on her face . <newline> A few steps backward , eyes scanning the blacks and greys of the yard , and I grabbed the .22 I kept just inside the door for foxes and crows . It ’ d stop a dog as well . Could be trouble if it was a razorback out there but if it was I ’ d be able to grab something with more stopping power before it caused too much trouble . I moved down the veranda , away from the light and behind the passionfruit vine , hiding from whatever was out there . A tap on my thigh brought Millie to my side , her body tense where she pressed against my leg . <newline> And then I heard something . The wind , I thought . It ’ s just the wind . But the vine was still , leaves only moving when they released a drop of water to splat onto the muddy ground . I felt a chill of fear run down my back at the same time as excitement quivered in my stomach . <newline> A voice . It was a voice I could hear . Faint , distant , but coming closer . <newline> I tapped Millie under the jaw and the growl stopped . A tap on my thigh and I moved further down the veranda and around the side of the house , Millie by my side . The two of us slipped under the railing and moved quickly across the yard to the tree line where I stopped and looked back . The light from the house shone through the open door , lending its illumination to the moon ’ s . I couldn ’ t hear the voice anymore , would have thought I ’ d imagined it if it wasn ’ t for the tense dog at my side . I waited . And then I heard it again . Someone talking . I couldn ’ t hear them moving , the bush was waterlogged and soaked up any noise their passage made but they were close enough now that I could hear the desperation in their voice even if I couldn ’ t make out what they were saying . <newline>

1,"It is an old-fashioned bar - at least , that is how it wishes to present itself . In reality , it is a converted coffee shop , which in turn had been a small office space , housed in a building that could only claim a little more than two decades to its name . <newline> <newline> The walls are plastered with oddities ; peculiar signs , quaint paintings , and mixed wallpapers attempt , perhaps even successfully , to convey an air of haphazardness . Walking through the door - a large , wooden , construction , painted dark green and with a four-paned window fitted in its upper half , comes a young man - in reality 25 years of age , but looking closer to his early twenties . With a familiar hesitation , and the cursory nod of acknowledgement to the bartender , he seats himself in one of the small booths to the right of the entrance . Wearing a hazel cardigan , with dark brown elbow patches , dark jeans , and sporting a light brown leather satchel to his side , he is clearly distinguished from the normal clientele at this time of day . From the satchel he produces a notebook , followed by a pencil and a phone , and places them on the table in front of him . The first page of the notebook reads : `` What do I want to do ? '' <newline> <newline> Such a simple question , one would think - being brought up in a safe , supportive , middle-class family , in a modern and developed Western nation , he should have every opportunity to explore his passions and find what he would like to do , right ? What could possibly be holding him back when all the doors are already opened for him ? <newline> <newline> Well , it 's just that , is n't it ? With only one door open , the path forward is trivial . With a hundred doors , suddenly a choice needs to be made - one needs to choose the *right* door , the one that will lead to the *right* life , the life that is *right* for him . Should one choose the wrong door , and have the wrong life , one will invariably end up with chronic regret . Needless to say , this is an important decision . <newline> <newline> His parents , and especially his grandparents , love to speak of the freedom he has , and of how great it is . In their day , they had no freedom - they did what they had to , they did what would lead to a good job - not the job that they were passionate about , unless they were very lucky of course , but a job that would allow them to have a family , to have a complete and fulfilling life . With no choice , there could also be no regret , because they could never take a wrong turn . They could never step through the wrong door . <newline> <newline> For him , this choice was a nightmare that would never end . A fear that he could never outrun , no matter how much he tried , no matter what distractions he flooded his senses with . Even when he tried to wish away the choice by simply picking the first best thing he could think of , it would only be a matter of time until those thoughts found him again . It would only be a matter of time until they drained his happiness , stole his sleep , and left deep clawmarks on the inside of his skull . <newline> <newline> He tried journalism . He had always enjoyed writing , and had also usually proved himself quite capable during highschool , so it seemed a natural choice , but he never quite felt that he fit in . His classmates were friendly , nothing wrong with them , and the work was interesting , but it just never felt *right* . He quit after a year and went on to the next adventure - a career in mathematics should surely suit him , given his natural affinity for logic and reasoning . Besides , people were constantly telling him how intelligent he was - whether he actually was , well , that was a topic for another time . To make things more interesting , he decided he should study abroad as well - everyone 's always saying how much you learn from that , so it must surely be good . <newline> <newline> Off he went , and for a time it was good . He got his degree , he built up a facade of interest , a pretend passion , for his subject - he even believed it himself - and returned home to continue with his fantasy . Unsurprisingly , it all came crashing down in a spectacular fashion , eventually bringing him to an uninteresting bar on this most depressing of Sunday afternoons , staring at that unrelenting question . <newline> <newline> How do other people find their passions ? He had read countless accounts of childhoods spent in pursuit of a singular goal , of minds sporting such capacity for understanding that they could master any task presented to them , and of the great entrepreneurs whose drive was only matched by their ambition , and he could relate to none of it . Was he forever doomed to be passion-less ? Would he go through life a simple worker bee , going through the motions as time ticked slowly by ? <newline> <newline> Of course , the view is warped - that image he has seen of other people is just that , an image , and not evidence of total happiness and remarkable success . One could even say he should have realised that a long time ago , seeing as he himself had gone through the exact same process , presenting a similarly fantastical illusion of his own life , but unfortunately for the young man , we do not look at others with the same eyes we see ourselves . <newline> <newline> At twilight the window by his booth was bursting with gold , and he took that as his cue to leave . After all , he had n't gotten much sleep lately and must try to get to bed early tonight , lest he be unable to focus in tomorrow 's lecture . Stepping out into the unforgiving briskness of late autumn , he started on his way home . Perhaps tomorrow would show him better luck . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> This needed to be written more than it needed to be read - it 's the premise of something I 've been thinking of exploring but have n't . English is not my native tongue , so if you see any formulations that strike you as odd or out of place , I would definitely appreciate the feedback .

1,"He woke up . <newline> <newline> He was at work , in his cubicle , before his desk , which was littered with sheets of paper and items of stationery . Clearly , an effort had been made very recently to organise the desk 's contents , but entropy had once more taken hold . There were no personal effects on the desk or pinned to the wall . An ageing flatscreen monitor sat expectantly on the far edge of his desk , behind an old and tolerably clean keyboard . Numbers rolled across a spreadsheet in their dreary masses , and tabs along its lower edge promised acres more of bountiful crops of digits . <newline> <newline> The trouble was that he had no memory of any of this . <newline> <newline> His face wore a stupefied expression – wide-eyed , open-mouthed , motionless . With a jolt of self-consciousness , he snapped his mouth shut and hurriedly rubbed the last dregs of sleep from his eyes . This completed , his gaze fell upon a small pocket mirror on the desk . It seemed out of place ; he picked it up and took a look at himself . Brown eyes , entirely unremarkable , stared back at him from a pale , triangular face framed by curly brown hair . Yet as he turned the mirror this way and that , a glint of confidence entered the eyes , and the ghost of a smile crept into his lips , as welcome realisation dawned on him at last . <newline> <newline> He was the main character in a short story . <newline> <newline> `` Peter ! '' The voice startled him . He turned , wondering if they 'd introduce his nemesis this quickly . A tall , balding man stood looming at the entrance to his cubicle . His eyes were entirely in shadow , his arms were crossed and his moustache twitched with irritation . `` What , '' he growled stiffly , `` are you doing ? '' <newline> <newline> He felt the stupefied expression on his face again , but it felt appropriate at this point . `` Uh ... '' The noise was appropriate too . A vague plan formed in his head . Play the vacant fool , end the conversation as quickly as possible and then spend a while figuring out his backstory . Maybe even give the spreadsheet a closer look once he was done . Distantly , he realised he 'd been given a name . Peter . He liked it . He felt like a Peter already . <newline> <newline> The looming man 's eyes suddenly widened , blazing with fury . `` Are you ... smiling ? ! '' he drawled incredulously . To his horror , Peter realised he was . He thought quickly , and decided to run with it . He was the main character ; surely he could do what he liked . <newline> <newline> `` Yes I am ! '' he replied brashly , springing from his chair towards the looming man . He 'd left out the comma between `` Yes '' and `` I '' for emphasis , and it had worked ; the old man was in a daze . This pleased him immensely . He tried it a different way . `` Yes – I – AM ! '' His voice fell on each word like a pianist striking the final , *fortissimo* chords at the conclusion of some piece in a minor key . His eyes were manic . He grabbed the man by his shirt and thrust his wide , drunkard 's smile in his face . <newline> <newline> `` I am sick ... '' he growled , `` and tired of your ... '' Here he paused . He had never read a book , but he had the feeling he would n't think much of one that used swearing to make its point . `` ... Shenanigans ! Er ... '' His voice rose magnificently before faltering . `` Help me out here , '' he pleaded awkwardly . `` Your name ... Uh ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Randy , '' replied the man , now too flummoxed to do anything but co-operate . <newline> <newline> `` Randy ! '' He spat the name back with feeling . `` I 'm out of this dump ! '' He thrust Randy away , whooped and danced past him . Randy stared wordlessly at him as he skipped down the corridor . `` I 'm done with ... Names ! And ... Spreadsheets ! '' This last word came as he started down the stairs . <newline> <newline> The story had begun . Peter rode the adrenaline tide halfway down the stairs , taking two at a time , before slowing to a confident saunter after three flights . At this point , he realised his trouser pockets were full . Reaching excitedly into his right pocket , he extracted a leather wallet that flipped open to reveal a driving licence . PETER MAYFLOWER ... 02.10.87 ... 27 TAILOR STREET ... His eyes flashed over the capital letters , absorbing his own details with glee . Where did he live ? Who were his friends ? Who was his family ? These questions and countless rushed through his head , but only in context of the biggest question – what was relevant to the plot ? <newline> <newline> He sailed past the receptionists ' stares into the street , where he stopped and surveyed the scene . People milled back and forth along the pavements of a busy city . Growing impatient , he chewed his lip and scoured the street for ... Anything . Something had to happen soon , in order to advance the plot . Quitting his job was no good on its own . Some way to his left , a homeless man sat on the ground , staring vacantly into space . Peter shrugged , dug a note from his wallet at random , strode down the street and thrust it in the man 's hands , smiling . <newline> <newline> `` This is a twenty , '' the man stammered in disbelief . <newline> <newline> `` Keep it , '' replied Peter , almost singing the words . <newline> <newline> `` Who are you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm the main character ! '' he replied , rotating to face him . `` And something , '' – at this he turned his face to the skies – `` is going to happen to me ! '' <newline> <newline> He stood thus for a few seconds , breathing heavily at the iron-grey clouds . He was vaguely aware of people 's stares sliding over him . He ignored them . Something had to happen soon . <newline> <newline> Did n't it ?

1,"“ Mr . Vomer , ” she announced coolly , setting her case in the middle of his office . “ I ’ m Harriet Walsh . I am here for your Culling. ” <newline> <newline> Arnold Vomer paled instantly and began searching the room for a way out . “ This must be a mistake . You have the wrong Arnold Vomer. ” It was nearly a scream . <newline> <newline> Harriet shook her head . “ No , sir . I never get it wrong . Citizen Code 115937092 . I am required to give you five minutes to sort you affairs . Don ’ t try and run , Mr. Vomer , or you forfeit your five minutes. ” <newline> <newline> The broken record speech done , Mr. Vomer nearly fell onto his desk chair , covering his face with his hands . Apparently he hadn ’ t come to terms with it as some had ; that always made her job harder . At least he wasn ’ t resisting yet . There was always that . <newline> <newline> “ Can I call my wife ? ” he asked softly , staring at the desk still . <newline> <newline> Harriet nodded . “ Only on speaker phone . Personal policy. ” <newline> <newline> Mr. Vomer nodded slowly , a tear falling from his eye . He moved to the phone , pressing the first preset and then the speaker button . The rings covered the awkward silence . <newline> <newline> “ Hello ? ” came the soft , matronly voice from the other end . “ When are you coming home , Arnie ? ” <newline> <newline> Arnold was beginning to pour tears , but he kept his voice steady . “ Uh , I won ’ t be , Viv . I won ’ t be. ” <newline> <newline> Viv gasped . “ It ’ s time , isn ’ t it , Arnold ? ” <newline> <newline> Arnold gulped , his face pained as he stared at Harriet . “ Yes , Viv . It is . I wanted you to know that my will is in order like I promised . Patrick will run the company , but you will get half the profit . You ’ ll always be set , sweetheart . Don ’ t worry about money or the kid . Could I speak to him ? ” <newline> <newline> Viv was sobbing , but she made a whine that might have been a yes . Then some rough static . Then a small voice . <newline> <newline> “ Hi , Daddy . Why is Mommy crying ? ” the little boy asked . Apparently his parents hadn ’ t explained to him ahead of time . That was always difficult . <newline> <newline> “ Son , you are going to have to be the man of the house now . Daddy has to go away for a while . Take care of your mom for me. ” Arnold was choking out his words now . “ I love you for always , Mikey. ” <newline> <newline> “ I love you too , Daddy . For always , ” the child answered . Viv took the phone back , her tears still wrenching themselves from her body . <newline> <newline> “ Is he there now ? ” she asked . “ Is he listening to us ? ” <newline> <newline> Arnold glanced back at Harriet . “ She is. ” <newline> <newline> Viv swallowed hard , and her voice came out like knives . “ I hope you rot , bitch. ” <newline> <newline> “ Just doing my job , Mrs. Vomer . My condolences for your loss. ” <newline> <newline> Viv burst into tears again . “ I love you , Arnie . I always will. ” <newline> <newline> “ I love you too , Viv . I ’ ll see you around , sweetheart. ” <newline> <newline> The phone line went dead under his finger as he glared up at Harriet . He leaned back in his chair and just stared at her like his anger could vanish her away . <newline> <newline> “ You still have two minutes , Mr. Vomer , ” she reminded him . “ Anyone else to call ? ” <newline> <newline> Arnold shook his head . “ I sorted this out last month . I guess I never expected to be one of the first . I thought I ’ d have at least a year . Maybe even three . But at least I planned ahead anyways . That ’ s what got me this company , you know ? ” <newline> <newline> He chuckled softly and looked around . “ I would give it all up to keep my family right now . Funny how that works. ” <newline> <newline> Harriet opened her guitar case . Inside was , well , a guitar . But in the lining pocket was her pistol . <newline> <newline> Arnold sat still and folded his hands on his desk . “ You know I have money . I could set you up for life . What will it take to make you leave here right now ? ” <newline> <newline> Harriet loaded the magazine quietly and efficiently . Without looking up , she replied , “ Mr . Vomer , this is my job . I refuse to fail at my job . You can ’ t businessman your way out of everything . I won ’ t accept your money , just your life. ” <newline> <newline> Arnold leaned forward in his chair , resting on his elbows . “ I could send you anywhere in the world . Anywhere at all . With bags of money and a brand new car. ” <newline> <newline> Harriet smirked as she popped in her ear plugs . “ This won ’ t hurt a bit , Mr. Vomer . Just sit back and relax . You ’ ve been very cooperative today . Thanks for you time. ” She held up the gun in both hands , steadied her arms , aimed , and fired . <newline> <newline> Arnold slumped in his chair , the bullet wound trickling blood from his forehead . His mouth moved a few times before everything stopped . He was still . Harriet walked over and checked his pulse . Faint . Fainter . Gone . She mentally checked Arnold Vomer off the list and placed the government-issued letter of condolence on his desk for his wife to collect later . Then she placed her gun back in her case , closed it up , and headed home for a cup of tea and a shower .

1,"I originally submitted this to no sleep , where it was removed for various reasons I still disagree with . Not amazing , but I liked it . <newline> <newline> `` Podcast not found '' <newline> <newline> It started innocently enough . I get tired when I drive , but if I use headphones and find a good podcast , I do ok. You find strategies like these when you live in the middle of nowhere and going anywhere is a drive . Fiction Podcasts are my favorite , and the creepy ones keep me especially interested . The Black tapes , Night vale , all good listening when you ’ re bored and trying to stay awake . <newline> <newline> While downloading some new shows one night , a suggestion caught my interest . “ Podcast not found ” was categorized as fiction/horror , and the description said only “ listen at your own risk. ” I ’ ve always been a sucker for a good sales gimmick , so I downloaded a few episodes and figured I ’ d give it a try . It was a few days before I came around to it , and having a 45 minute drive home , I hit play with a little bit of excitement . The intro was a slow , menacing piano tune that seemed to echo into an empty , hollow space . When the music ended , there was silence , which was soon broken by a soft sob and ragged breathing . Coincidently I cleared my throat at this time , and created the greatest accidental sync up of all time . I cleared my throat just moments before the sobbing abruptly stopped , and the narrator , a young woman , began to talk . “ Hello ? Are you there ? I think I heard you . I can ’ t believe I ’ ve finally made contact…. ” <newline> <newline> A simple thing , but I was hooked immediately . <newline> <newline> It quickly became my favorite podcast , and I listened to it every chance I got . The young woman was a character named Lilyana , and she claimed to be lost between the folds of reality . She had become lost in the woods outside her town , and began a series of Alice in wonderland type adventures , each more symbolic and fascinating than the last . The writing of the podcast was amazing , and the actress was particularly impressive . Lilyana soon became like a real person to me , and I reveled in her experiences , each one seemingly written to explain things in my own life ; many of my own flaws and struggles were seemingly transformed into beautiful and articulate metaphors . I could not believe I ’ d never heard of this podcast before . It was revolutionary . <newline> <newline> There was about 12 hours in all , and I was through it all in 3 days . The last episode was heart wrenching . It ended with a plea from Lilyana , asking the listener to find her , to help her go home . Her final plea sent shivers down my spine : “ to you that are listening , I can feel you . Won ’ t you tell me who you are ? Please ? I ’ m so tired of being alone…. ” I was choked up , tears flowing . I thickly cleared my throat and tried to wipe the tears away , when Lilyana ’ s voice declared “ I can hear you ! Are you there ? ” And the podcast ended , my iPod showing me the next series on my list . <newline> <newline> With such a strong ending , I needed to know what happened next . Once home , I searched the web for the website , but was unable to find it anywhere . Ironically , every podcast site I searched seemed to mock me , using the phrase “ podcast not found ” to explain that there was no such podcast . I searched and searched , and I could find nothing . Not a website , a production company… . I couldn ’ t even find the iTunes page from which I had originally downloaded it . I went to my iPod to see if the episodes had any sort of info that could help me , and found that the episodes had been erased . <newline> <newline> This amazing new world I had discovered was suddenly , inexplicably gone . <newline> <newline> I asked around , and I couldn ’ t find anyone who had ever heard of the podcast . I searched forums , websites , and production studios . It was if it never existed . Having no other option , I let it go . <newline> <newline> Weeks later , an iTunes email arrived , informing me that one of my podcasts had released a new episode . I clicked , to find myself again looking at the iTunes page for “ podcast not found. ” There was single , 30 second episode on the list . I quickly hit play expecting it to be an ad or update for the next season . I wasn ’ t prepared for what I heard . <newline> <newline> Lilyana ’ s voice echoed from the speakers , saying the one thing I never expected : My name . “ John , John are you there ? I know you ’ re listening John . Please , come find me John . I need your help . I will send you directions soon. ” <newline> <newline> I was agape . “ What the fuck ? ! ? ! ” I declared to the screen . This had to be coincidence . Then the voice seemingly replied “ Language , John . I ’ ll explain soon. ” <newline> <newline> I don ’ t know what to believe . I resumed my search , and I can still find no mention of the podcast anywhere . IS Lilyana real ? Is she lost somewhere , or have I just discovered the most unsettling piece of viral marketing ever ? I can ’ t know for sure . What I do know is this : there ’ s another iTunes email in my inbox , telling me that a new episode is waiting . The link in the email seems to be the only way to listen to it . I tried searching through iTunes directly , and the same words keep appearing , a terrifying message I ’ m unsure of how to interpret : “ Podcast not found. ” <newline> <newline>

1,"A recent short . I know technically it 's not up to speed and I need some work on formatting and editing , but I 'm mainly working on just getting ideas to words and words to page right now . It does n't have a title yet , just look for some genuine feedback . Thanks everybody ! <newline> _______________________________ <newline> <newline> “ Okay , we ’ ll meet you back here in thirty . Sound good ? ” <newline> Smooch <newline> “ Okay love , you girls have fun ! ” <newline> <newline> Gene blushed while watching Sarah and baby Ivy walk away , still feeling the warmth of his wife ’ s lips on his own . Her hair shined in the mid-afternoon sunlight of the mall skylights . Little Ivy waved goodbye ( for now ) to her daddy , off on another adventure with mommy . They had agreed to split up : she would get bathroom towels and he would find a microwave for the kitchen . They had been in their new home for just under three weeks , still unpacking , filling in gaps of missing domestic accouterment . Gene gazed around the mall and immediately felt the nagging weight of his age : two young teenagers lazily drifted by , talking loudly about something , laughing , their smiles wide , their brows unburdened by things such as mortgage payments , credit card payments , daycare payments , electric bill payments , hot water heater repairman payments . Gene remembered with warm fondness twenty years ago , when minor indiscretions such as school ground arguments led to insurmountable weekend ending catastrophes . A weekend grounded alone in my room reading books ? A luxury a family man of 35 can not afford . At 15 his favorite book had been a yellowed copy of James Fenimore Cooper ’ s The Last of the Mohicans , his fathers name inscribed on the inside cover , the dusky smell of the old pages emanating from the novel . It had been his childhood favorite ; he had vivid memories of his mother , her face warm and kind , the names of the Indians rolling off her lips , enticing him with their alien nature : Natty Bumppo , Uncas , Chingachgook . Lost in thoughts long past , Gene found himself wandering almost unconsciously into a local bookstore . Microwave payments could surely wait another 15 minutes , he thought . <newline> <newline> In the Fiction section , under C , he found it . It was a newer edition , its pages white and unused , its cover unmarked , unbent , unscuffed . He opened it carefully , delicately , not unlike the first time he held baby Ivy in his arms . His world had changed completely when her tiny eyes opened for the first time and caught him , looking down at her . Everything had slipped away , as if she and him were the only two people in the room , building , city , universe . Years had passed since then and the imminence of that singular moment had started to fade . What remained was a world of spills , pediatrician appointments , late evenings , early mornings , packing , unpacking , trips to the mall , walking around in a near daze wondering how a boy , with the world in front of him , a near infinite number of uncertainties and probabilities , became a man with a child of his own . He turned to the final pages of the novel , remembering the twinge of sadness when his mother had finished it . It was cold that night , sometime in December . Christmas was near , but that night it was raining , and he felt a great pit of sadness inside his chest . As his eyes closed and his young mind drifted off to sleep , he imagined himself the last of a “ wise race ” – alone in the world . <newline> <newline> “ What are you reading , babe ? ” <newline> He felt Sarah ’ s delicate grip on his arm , pulling him back from the past . He turned in a startled daze , his eyes slowly returning from a place long lost , except from memory , and found the soft blue welcoming eyes of his wife . <newline> “ Is everything ok ? ” <newline> He thought briefly of brushing it off with an attempted casual “ yeah , fine ” , but Sarah always knew when he was being dishonest . When he ’ d inquired how she ’ d gained such a superpower she had said simply : “ it ’ s your eyes. ” <newline> “ Just lost in thought , babe . Everything ’ s fine. ” <newline> Sarah leaned in and kissed him softly on the cheek , whispering gently into his ear : “ Liar ” , smiling . Gene blushed and returned her smile . <newline> “ What is that , daddy ? A book ? ” <newline> Gene kneeled down and handed the novel to Ivy , her eyes looking over the illustrated cover , her fingers running over the spine . He smiled down at his daughter , seeing so much of his own younger self in her , an innocent and pure wonder , a self he had long thought forgotten . <newline> “ Yes , Ivy . My mommy read this to me when I was just a little older than you . Every night before bed , in fact . I hadn ’ t thought about it in a long time. ” <newline> Ivy pondered this quietly for a moment . Then her eyes lit up as she exclaimed in excitement , “ Can we read this tonight too , daddy ? ” <newline> “ Yeah daddy , can we ? ” Sarah teased . <newline> He contemplated the people around him , his young daughter , the world in front of her full of endless possibilities and uncertainties , and the delicate eyes of his wife , eyes that loved , that could see through his fog , could see him for the boy and man he really was , and could love both equally without reservation , and suddenly the weight of adulthood seemed easy to bare , because he would never again have to bare them alone . <newline> Gene smiled at them , his family , his companions , his tribesmen . His fellow Mohicans . <newline> “ I suppose we can , girls . ”

1,"**This is a scene from the novel I 'm trying to write , *Jump Kid* . For a bit of context , the main character has just discovered that he has superpowers , and has been approached by a famous superhero . Let me know what you think ! ** <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Lion-Man looked just like all the pictures in the news . Tall , muscular , white and gold outfit . The photographs never seem to capture his smile , I noticed . He always has this kind of smile that says `` I know what you 're about to do , and I 'm sure as shit not about to let you do it . '' Lion-Man was here , on the roof of Quality China , and he was smiling at me . <newline> <newline> I was n't thinking about his smile at the time , however . I opened and closed my mouth a couple times before managing a weak `` You ... you 're real ! Lion-Man is real ! '' <newline> <newline> Lion-Man laughed a little bit . `` I 'm about as real as real can get . '' He had the deepest voice that you 've ever heard . Even when he 's just laughing , you can hear it reverberating in your bones . I was in shock . Lion-Man could apparently tell , because he took a few steps back and sat down on an air conditioning vent . `` Do n't worry , Billy , you 're not in trouble . I was just hoping we could talk . '' <newline> <newline> If that was meant to calm my nerves , it had the opposite effect . Lion-Man , The man who has repeatedly saved the President of the United States , wants to talk to me ! `` Uh ... Yeah-I-I mean-yeah , sure ! What 's upyou want to talk about ? '' ( Here , I meant to say `` What 's up ? '' and ended up saying `` What do you want to talk about ? '' ) <newline> <newline> `` I would think it 's obvious . '' He go up and walked to the edge of the roof , looking down into the alley I had come from . `` That 's nearly a twelve foot leap , from the ground to here , '' he mused , `` and you ca n't be more than five feet tall . Very impressive . '' <newline> <newline> I puffed my chest out . `` Actually , I 'm five-five . '' <newline> <newline> `` No you 're not . '' Lion-Man crossed his his arms over his chest and looked at me . The smile was gone . He seemed to be looking through me now . `` Billy . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes ? Uh , I mean , yes sir ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You have superpowers . '' <newline> <newline> I thought for a moment , then said `` No , I do n't . '' <newline> <newline> Lion-Man looked stunned , for just a second . `` Why do you say that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Because it 's true ! People like me do n't get superpowers . I must have been riding an adrenaline rush or something when I climbed up here . I 'm sorry Lion-Man , but you 're wrong about me- '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , I was startled by the sound of Lion-Man 's roar . Aside from the strength and the flying , that was Lion-Man 's super power . It was the loudest sound that I had ever heard . I was so badly startled , I must have jumped ten feet straight up . Literally . I remember having a trampoline-esque moment of weightlessness , and looking down to see Lion-Man , standing on the roof . When I tumbled back on the roof , Lion-Man was sternly glaring down at me . `` I 've been wrong before , Billy , '' he bristled , a low rumble in his voice , `` but I 'm never wrong about potential teammates . '' <newline> <newline> I nearly peed in my pants , but then I realized what he said . `` ... Teammates ? '' <newline> <newline> When Lion-Man spoke again , the growl in his voice was gone . `` You may have superpowers , but you do n't know how to use them . I could teach you . There 's a place in New Mexico , for people like you ... like us . '' He offered me his hand , helping me up . I took it . `` I 'm offering you an opportunity , Billy . A chance to hone your abilities . A chance to be an agent of change in the world . A chance to be a Superhero , like me . '' <newline> <newline> I was silent . I was silent for a long , long time . This was a dream come true . Literally , I have had dreams where me and Lion-Man are best friends and hang out . But now that the opportunity was here , staring me in the face ... <newline> <newline> `` I ... I do n't know ... '' I meant to say it louder than I did . I cleared my throat , and tried again . `` I mean , this is my life ! I '' m not sure if I can just walk out on my family , on my friends ... I 'm sorry , Lion-Man . '' I suddenly felt embarrassed , and stared down at my ratty tennis shoes . <newline> <newline> I felt Lion-Man 's hand on my shoulder . I looked up , and he was smiling at me . But not the smug smile from before , a more reassuring one . `` I understand . Take some time to think about it . '' He walked over to the edge of the roof , getting ready to take off . `` I 'll be in touch . '' He knelt down , and then leapt into the sky . <newline> <newline> I watched him turn into a grey dot against the setting sun , then I pulled my phone and called up Owen . <newline> <newline> `` Billy ! You alright , my dude ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . Listen , I need to talk to you . Uh ... can you bring a ladder to Quality China ? ''

1,"The half dragon girl ( started , incomplete ) <newline> <newline> The busy coffee shop was filled with morning commuters needing their caffeine fix . The TV in the corner has local news but nobody is watching . Retired old men who wake before the sun are discussing how bad the president is screwing up foreign relations . The old men sit at the table as they do everyday . The same people come on the same days and everybody is a usual by now . Wendy greets people she knows by first name asking them if they want to have the same thing they usually get . Unknowns are not shunned , but they do n't get the same welcome as the usual crowd . She will coldly say , `` What can I get you '' She might warm up to calling you `` hun '' after a few visits and after a few more , if your a regular , she will learn your name . <newline> <newline> Bob had a Latte , Ken peppermint green tea and Adam was drinking a plain black coffee . Old school friends who reconnected later in life , they do n't hold their punches . Teasing each other , almost to the point of bulllying . Making fun of each other with the way close male friends do . But they all knew each other well enough not to go too far or say something too hurtful . Bob and Ken were talking about the old girlfriends . Adam was distracted , not really interested . In to the shop walks a preteen girl , green blue jeans , a pink shirt and a black leather backpack thrown over her shoulder . Wendy repeats back to her `` iced tea and a scone , you got it . '' <newline> <newline> After taking out her yellow Pikachu wallet and paying , she sits at a table for two , by herself . The guys are usually eagle eyed for hot women who come into the shop . Kind of a game who can see the hotties first . But as Bob and Ken were distracted , Adam notices the girl . As he switches from eye spy mode to concerned citizen mode he pan around to spot her mother who must be near by , or in the car parked in the front , or in the bathroom . But she is not there . He spies the girl some more . Thoughts of where her parents are , if she was by herself or what was going on drifted through his mind . Suddently Bob and Ken start talking about going on a road trip and this perks his attention . Adam lets it go and starts talking about the drive through the desert towards Reno , Nevada . <newline> <newline> She chose this coffee shop as she would not be known here . Nobody would know her here . There were not any eyes on here here though . She could move on . Finishing her cold drink and taking a last bite of her hard bland scone , she threw away her trash and departed . She walked down the street . <newline> <newline> Adam got in his old pickup truck , his engine hesitating then starting . He turned out onto the street . Looking left . Looking right . He saw the girl . Walking down the street towards a commercial building park . Looking in the rear view , nobody behind him , he looked at the girl again . Was she a run-away , was her mom working in a office building close by , what was going on . He thought about how bad he would feel if tomorrow he heard on the news about some girl who was attacked or worst . He thought about asking is she was ok , but he imagined the awkwardness and decided not to . Turning onto the street , he looked in the rear view mirror to get another look , hoping to see a mother waiting for her or something , but she was gone . He went to work with his lingering concern . <newline> <newline> Karen walked off the street and into a river overpass . She walked into the round concrete underpass . She looked both ways and then when nobody was looking went in between the rusted chain link fence and the fence pole . Almost not fitting . Down the rocky riverlet shore into the overpass . <newline> <newline> Maybe she is getting too sensitive , and there were no clear hits today . She can usually sense the dark thoughts pretty well and tie it to a person . With very good accuracy . She has the ability to sense the dark evil thoughts as regular person can smell a skunk from miles away . But pinpointing it in both cased can be tricky . <newline> <newline> She is half demon , her mother 's mother was a demon who protected people of gentle hearts . Her grandmother protected people from accidents , she was responsible for giving people the sense to become more alert or to see something that would pass them by normally . Her mother took on the same role when she got old enough . She was supposed to marry a demon so that her linage could follow the same task . But the mother instead fell in love with a dragon slayer knight . Their child had half the power of the mother . She inherited some of the mother 's powers and inherited the stubbornness and courage of her father . <newline> <newline> Once fully in the concrete pipe under the road , without anyones eyes or cameras on her , she thought of home . Her old cozy stone cottage in the middle of a rural green field . Fenced in with twigs and wire the front yard had chickens pecking at the ground . She envisioned it and mentally really focused on what it looked like inside . Closing her eyes she thought of ther fireplace . In the concrete pipe she dissolved into nothingness . As her focus came to a peak she was now in her house . A swirl of particles came together.The warmth of the fireplace hit her and she opened her eyes to the mantle and her mug where she had left it . <newline> <newline> ...

1,"Superdad <newline> <newline> <newline> The sunlight from the window blinded my eyes- a flash of red . <newline> I quickly pulled the wool blanket over my body and definitely over my head I wanted the blanket to wrap me tightly like a burrito . <newline> <newline> Another day of work great ... .my face made a frown as I was thinking , it felt as I was living in repetition , the sun came down on the 359th day and the sun rose bright and early to welcome us to the 359th day . <newline> <newline> I rolled over from my belly ( `` it 's been getting larger '' ) , I extended my hand out to the cold , poorly lit-room I was hoping to grab my phone , instead I grasp the wood from my dresser . My head was still hiding under the wool blanket . <newline> <newline> I wished for another five minutes to lay in this warm , toasty bed . I needed to take my morning shower , I had to avoid getting late , I been hunting for a promotion , and I do not want John to have ANY reason to not give it to me ! <newline> <newline> When it came time to really head for work so I would n't get late , I struggled to get out this comfy , life-giving bed . I seemed to fall into the bed deeper and deeper . <newline> <newline> I gathered my energy and used it all to tear myself away from the bed . ( `` I have to rip myself off as fast as a band-aid from this bed , or I will be stuck here forever '' ) <newline> <newline> I clutched the cold metal and turned it , - Cleek ! - the shower head dumped water on the white bathtub . Then another wave of water came from the showerhead . This time it was a constant flow of water . I let out a sigh ... I knew the water would be cold at first , usually takes 30 seconds for it to heat up . <newline> <newline> I ran my hand under the water , the water was cold to the touch , through it felt good ... it was a bit out of the routine , maybe that 's why . <newline> Everytime I stepped into the shower , I picked up my thoughts where I left off the day before . <newline> The thought that occupied my mind currently was to go back into time . <newline> ( `` Ariz going back in time , I would go right back before I got my first job . ) <newline> <newline> ( `` This time I would n't have listen to my parents about being a doctor , or an engineer ! For God 's sake is that the only profession in the world to them ! '' ) <newline> <newline> But I did n't blame them , I blamed myself mostly . I felt stuck working these jobs . My schedule was haywire , I tried to get as much as shut-eye as I can bewteen my two jobs . <newline> <newline> I stepped out the shower , my body was greeted by the cold wind of the restroom . I walk past the towel rack , I feel as I 'm going to air dry myself today . <newline> <newline> I checked myself out in the mirror , I was looking good . I wanted this day to be different , so I gave myself a short pep talk . I lazily put one pant leg over the other , while deciding if I should call in sick or not . I just had to make sure I get that promotion , I needed to know I was going somewhere in the company . <newline> <newline> Heading downstairs , I walked down the stairs , the stairs were even cozy today , they were made of a beige carpet . I slid my hand down the white railing . The paints been chipping off lately . And there 's dirty handprints all over it . <newline> <newline> I went to the kitchen to make myself breakfest and lunch for later . Then I hear the faintest sound of little feet scurrying off to the restroom . I knew who that was , Nasar . His stomach always hurts in the morning . <newline> <newline> I tell him all that spicy food , that he never wants to stop eating , because ( `` oh it makes everything taste so much better ! '' ) I mentally smile to myself , that kid is literally crazy . <newline> After I finish making the sandwich that I called , God 's gift to the world . It had everything on it ! The whole nine , it made day go by just a little bit easier . <newline> <newline> I heard Nasar coming down , -tuk- -tuk-tuk- . You could always tell it 's him , by the way he walks down the stairs . He asked me if I was heading to work . I told him , `` I am '' . I instinctively poured up a bowl of cereal , anytime he was up , he liked to have his breakfest with me . <newline> <newline> Sweet kid , he told me about what he learned the previous day . About how the human digestive system takes three hours to digest food . <newline> <newline> I looked at the clock , If I did n't leave now , I 'm going to be late . I stand up from my chair , as I 'm walking over to put my plate and his bowl in the dishwasher . Nasar says , `` do you really have to leave now ? ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes I do , plus you 're just going to fall asleep in five mins if I do stay '' . <newline> <newline> `` No I wo n't ! I could stay up . He put his fingers on his eyelid and opened his eyes wider to show that he could stay awake . <newline> <newline> What a werid kid I thought , I decided I would stay this one time . It 's was out of routine and hanging out with my son , is better than any promotion

1,"Seinfeld Saves the Enterprise <newline> <newline> _______ <newline> <newline> `` Quite Illogical , '' Data admonished the wild-haired man . The holo-synthesized visage of the infamous 20th century television character Kramer had just finished explaining `` the magic loogie '' incident . If Data could feel emotion , he would surely feel annoyed right now . None of the Seinfeld cast proved adept with physical systems or rudimentary computers . <newline> <newline> Data 's comm buzzed . With mechanical proficiency , the android 's fingers tapped to receive Jerry , `` Okay , we 're at the Engineering Bay . What now ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Proceed to the Warp Core room ... '' Data waited for the inevitable ... `` Uhh , which way is that ? '' Data vowed at positronic speed to store several ensign holo-engrams in the case of similar , future catastrophes . With the human crew disabled and the Warp Core malfunctioning , Data could not even access the Holo-deck 's full repository of simulations . For now , the Android was stuck with his personal cache of nearly useless sitcom holograms . Still , Data predicted better luck with Seinfeld than the Always Sunny cast . <newline> <newline> `` Move towards the bright glowing light , '' Data said . Several decks below , Jerry raised his hands in front of him towards and shrugged . `` Aye aye captain . '' <newline> <newline> Just then , George entered communication . `` Uhh , Data , this shuttle , I do n't think it 's working . '' Data 's subroutines examined several thousand possible malfunctions before settling on the most likely . `` George , have you started up the shuttle ? '' <newline> <newline> Silence . George 's jaw hung aghast as he eyed hundreds of unlabeled red and orange buttons . ** '' Little problem with that . `` ** <newline> <newline> ... several hours and an uncloaked Klingon Warship later ... <newline> <newline> `` Wharf , how can you bow to this cretin of a human ! Join us , take your rightful place and let us destroy the Enterprise ! '' The Klingon Captain gestured angrily to the Klingon-disguised Kramer . 'Captain Picard ' ( George ) stirred restlessly under the assault . <newline> <newline> Elaine impassively switched feet before lazily flicking her hair aside . `` I 'm *sensing* '' -she clucked the word between her teeth- `` you 're angry . '' <newline> <newline> Data prepared for the inevitable when Kramer furiously stood to his feet . `` You **insult** *the captain ? ! * Captain Pic- this man is stronger with one toe than your entire fleet ! '' George looked back in shock and fear at his friend . <newline> <newline> The Klingon captain laughed . His head rised and finally returned from Jollity . `` Look at him ! A paunchy squib of a man . My 2 year-old son could defeat him , and he can not yet hold a blade ! '' <newline> <newline> At this , George 's face darkened . `` *Oh yeah ? * '' The Klingon captain laughed , then said , `` you are not fit as a figurehead ! '' snarling out the sentence . <newline> <newline> `` Okay then big guy , you and me , let 's go ! Data , lower the shields , it 's me and him ! '' At the 'captain 's ' behest , Data lowered the shields . The Klingon captain demanded a pair bat'leths . Soon after , he teleported aboard . <newline> <newline> Data and the rest of the 'crew ' assembled in the transporter room . George 's angry confidence subsided when he saw the size of the brute . Data was about to reassure the frightened hologram when Elaine cocked an eyelash to the warrior-leader . George caught the gesture . A silent exchange ensued as George mouthed `` really , him ? '' and Elaine shrugged . Jerry suppressed a chuckle . <newline> <newline> `` **Picard** , I have awaited this day . This may be your ship , but combat is a Klingon tradition . '' The two began to circle each other in the transporter bay . Two Klingon enforcers stood between the rest of the cast & Data . <newline> <newline> `` Any last words for your epitaph , you paunchy louche ! ? '' The Klingon charged . <newline> <newline> ** '' Louche ? ** '' <newline> <newline> In a true contest , George would have lost handily . Unfortunately for the Klingon captain , Data had altered George 's mobile holo-emitter to give him five times the density of a standard human . <newline> <newline> The massive warrior crashed into George and deflected . George looked surprised , the enemy captain looked surprised , Data simply stared , calculating . His confidence restored , George trounced the enemy captain . The hologram hefted the Klingon with ease and thrashed him into the opposite wall of the transporter bay . <newline> <newline> A few more of these and the battle was over . The captain sat on his knees , head lowered before the superior human . George 's victory washed over him . `` End it quickly , human . Let me die a warrior 's death . '' George considered , heavily . The bat'leth in his hands , he finally glanced at Data . With a negative nod , George dropped the weapon . <newline> <newline> `` Next time , do n't be so quick to insult a *louche* . Get off my ship . '' The captain locked eyes with George and stood - a head taller than the indulgent human . Finally , George won the staring contest . <newline> <newline> `` Wharf , I was wrong to doubt your judgement . Truly , your captain **is** worthy of respect . **Qapla ' ! ** '' <newline> <newline> Quick as an eel , and with similar grace , Kramer mirrored the gesture and the Klingons teleported back to their ship . <newline> <newline> The Klingon ship disengaged . Jerry spoke first , `` Wow , Geo- '' but before he finished his sentence Data deactivated the holograms . He 'd finish the rest of the repairs in peace .

1,"You had me at Augmented <newline> <newline> Dammit ! I woke up with a start and slammed my head on the microwave again . Waking up , or rebooting in my case was always the hardest part of being augmented . Having an internet connected supercomputer in my brain , enhancing and adding senses to the ones I was born with was a trip . I could see magnetic fields and determine the amount of energy in a laser by looking at the beam . Allowing me & the other augmented to handle the math , physics and engineering needed to build the first fusion powered spaceships . It was hard in ways I expected and in ways I didn ’ t . <newline> <newline> The singularity came on time in the 2040s just like Kurzweil predicted . The merging of humans with advanced technology was one more step in a long history of people integrating non-biological items into their bodies . I guess the first “ implant ” was probably a prosthetic leg , then an arm , cochlear implants and other necessary improvements . Then we gorged on cosmetic surgery with boobs , botox , titanium hips and more . Chip implants came when bio-neural connections were reliably grown in a mouse then a chimp , then used to treat Parkinsons in humans . Wireless connection to the web was easy , induction charging took care of power needs . Mostly widespread adoption occurred , the holdouts being the bible belters and a few other too scared to try it , some too cowardly to admit it . <newline> <newline> Being an early adopter of tech was always a bit risky . I had to have the newest phone , fastest computer and most robust internet connection I could buy , borrow or steal . I sold my soul when I signed every waiver without really reading them knowing that there could be adverse reactions . I did n't care . I just wanted the implants . <newline> <newline> More memory , faster processors , more ability . I was walking around with a computer in my head and I loved it . I was connected to the Internet , I had the worlds information at my brains fingertips . I could diagnose any disease , win any trivia game , beat any chess master , outthink anybody trying to play any game with me anywhere at anytime , get any job and when I met someone I knew when they were lying , about what jobs they had and what degrees they 'd earned , not that degrees really mattered anymore . When everyone you know has a supercomputer in their head do PhDs really matter ? <newline> <newline> But the implant wouldn ’ t let me sleep . They never programmed sleep into the first chips , like the one I and the other early adopters had installed . I used to like to sleep , before the implants . The implant won ’ t let me sleep now . Not sleeping won ’ t kill me , not anymore , I won ’ t even go insane or become schizophrenic or anything . But sometimes I just want to sleep . <newline> <newline> When they installed them it was explained that the system was reasonably well protected against external attacks from hackers as well as from electromagnetic pulses or EMPs . Just in case there was a nuclear war or sunspots my implants would n't go dead and neither would I . <newline> <newline> But I wanted to sleep again and this was the only way I could now . I always liked pushing the limits so I disabled the safety latch again , put my head in the microwave and pushed sta… <newline> <newline>

1,"This is kinda long , and was written when I was 15 , but I 'm still a fan of it even though the technical aspects need to be worked on ! <newline> <newline> The Crow 's Nest <newline> <newline> <newline> THE YOUNG MALE sat still and silent , his brilliant eyes taking in the splendor before him . He 'd been told by his fellow crew mates that his eyes looked like the planet they 'd seen recently ; a rich blue , with specks of green dotting the oceans and flickers of reflected light in them- though that shining spot could very well have been put there by the burning curiosity within his soul . He found it hard to comprehend how the tools in which he used as a means of vision could possibly compare to the planet . In his memory , it was magnificent , an entity so beautiful that no technology could replicate it . It was something that could have only been born from somewhere within the vast universe , a creation of which no man could ever attempt . <newline> <newline> <newline> He stared at the cluster of bright dots before him , wondering at how the nebulae seemed to intertwine with each other in a web of twinkling stars , each tiny one joining with another to become a presence that he could not look away from . He was enraptured , caught by the beauty of the galaxy , by the existence of what he could never hope to reach , and just as well , for it was the very fact that it was untouched by man that made it so radiant . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Silas , '' a voice called out from below , causing him to jerk forward in surprise . Silas was not an easy man to scare- no , that was definitely not so- but he had come to acknowledge the power the universe had over him and how at ease he felt around it , so much so that even Zach , the large , colossal of a man , could sneak up on him undetected . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` We 've arrived . '' Zach informed , head craned upwards as he watched his captain lay back down and settle back into his previous position , arms behind his head and his legs crossed . He could n't help but shift his gaze towards what kept his captain so absorbed , nor could he help the usual burst of awe that filled his entire being whenever he saw the splendor of the stars . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` It 's a beautiful night , is n't it ? '' Silas asked , and that it was . <newline> <newline> <newline> He made no move to head back into the control center . From the tall structure on the deck , Silas could hear the subtle sounds of calm disarray and chaotic order that floated out from the control room . His favourite spot was the top of the large beam that was erected from the deck . It resembled the Crow 's Nest of one of the ancient ships he had seen in records , and he had stuck to the name . He liked it , for he wanted nothing more than to be like the beaked angels , free to explore the world , and whenever he 'd encounter the massive creatures , who 's bodies were lined with malleable metal that only nature could provide , he 'd pretend he was soaring just as high , floating in the air . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` You should head back in soon . The rest of the crew 's there , '' Zach replied , and he cast one more side-long glance at his absorbed captain . `` It 's much too beautiful a night to spend alone . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> The space within the aluminium walls of the control center was occupied by only fifteen people- sixteen , he corrected upon glancing down and noticing Zach 's retreating figure- but the noise generated threatened to burst out of the reinforced , armor-coated ship as the crew shouted over one another , yelling instructions and coordinates that seemed to melt into a jumble of words and numbers from what little Silas could hear . <newline> <newline> <newline> Silas watched as Zach went through the door at the far left of the deck , and he could almost see the small slither of noise struggling to make its final escape towards Silas ' haven , before being trapped when the metal-plated door slides shut . <newline> <newline> <newline> Silas sighed in contentment , reverting his gaze back to the stunning scenery . He enjoyed the light banter and companionship of his crew mates , but his heart belonged out on the Crow 's Nest ; where the silence did n't feel solitary , where the quiet enveloped him in a blanket of peace and security , where he felt distant from everyone else , but more connected to the world than ever . The deck was regarded that way by all seventeen members of the Apollo crew . It was where they could view their world in all its brilliance , not through the large , high-definition screens that lined every wall within the inside of the ship , but through their very own eyes , bright with wonder . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was without a doubt that the deck had a special place in everyone 's hearts , but the Crow 's Nest was their captain 's territory . For Silas , it was more than just a gazing deck to celebrate and get intoxicated ( the Apollos often had dinners on the deck , and even more often than that had brought out the various alcohols from their travels ) while under the stars . It was what made him who he was . That pillar the seemed to pierce through space was his place of comfort , its rounded railings the borders of his sanctuary . Most important of all , it was what introduced him to the wonders of the universe , and Silas could never forget the moment . <newline> <newline> Continued in the comments section !

1,"`` There is no prompt . Just write a story you 've always been thinking about , or one you 've been thinking about sharing . Anything goes . '' <newline> <newline> The old man looked at me , and gave a knowing wink . They were the words that I 'd needed to hear . I had been looking all over for inspiration from other people . For people to give me the start , or the theme . I 'd even visited Reddit 's writing prompts . But he was right . There is no prompt . You just have to write . So I went home , and wrote . I wrote tales of gods and demons , tales of men who could fly , tales of love , loss , hate and every other emotion I could think of . It was n't enough . I had to write more . I needed to . <newline> <newline> The old man 's words drove me , and I went to publishers with my works . They hated them . I was deflated , but not broken . I could still do this . The man had known , known that I was a writer , suffering from that problem . So I wrote about a kindly old man , who knew things . Who went around , and told people what they needed to hear . For me he had no name , for to put a crude label on one so great was a crime . <newline> <newline> This time one publisher said that they would put the book out there , but that I should n't expect it to make me a lot of money . I did n't mind , I would improve . I was already writing my next book . It was drawn from my darkest dreams , and seemed to flow out of me on its own accord . I was astounded , and the publishers loved it too . I wrote a sequel , then a third , the a whole saga . I wove a complex universe , and became a celebrated author . I had book signings , I sold the film rights to a successful director , and he put my world on the big screen . <newline> <newline> I was unstoppable . I wrote more and more . I found a guy who liked me for more than my books . We started going out . He asked me what my secret was . How the hell did I write so well . Was there some sort of prompt that I used . <newline> <newline> `` There is no prompt . Just write a story you 've always been thinking about , or one you 've been thinking about sharing . Anything goes . '' <newline> <newline> I echoed the words that I had heard so long ago . And soon my boyfriend was writing some short children 's stories . We were happy , and eventually , I proposed to him . He said yes . The wedding was beautiful , and we now live with our adopted daughter . Today is the day our first joint novel is released . It starts with a quote : 'There is no prompt . Just write a story you 've always been thinking about , or one you 've been thinking about sharing . Anything goes . ' <newline> <newline> We hope to inspire new authors the world over . We 're holding a book signing in our home city , and we 're expecting a good turnout . It 's all going well , and just before I take a break for lunch , a kindly , elderly gentleman approaches the desk , with two books . Our first , and my first . He looks at me , and I recognise him . <newline> <newline> `` I know that it 's a little unusual , but would you mind signing both of these ? '' <newline> <newline> Of course , I ca n't refuse him . I 'm just surprised that he 's still alive after all this time . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't be surprised , son , I 've been inspiring people 's passions , pushing them down the right path for a long time . But always remember , that even if I gave you the first push , you were the one who walked the path , you were the one who made this all . I wish you , and your family , the best of luck in your days , and a peaceful rest after . '' <newline> <newline> I numbly sign the books , and as he leaves , I call out after him . <newline> <newline> `` If you ever need my help , please , do n't hesitate to ask . '' <newline> <newline> He nods in acknowledgement , and leaves . I would meet him once more . Only once , as I lay dying , in a hospital bed . My husband would have been taken from me years earlier , and my daughter would be married with a child on the way . My daughter and her husband would be at my side , and he would walk in . He would look to me , and to my daughter , and finally to my son-in-law . And then he would speak . <newline> <newline> `` Do not worry , your father shall not suffer , for he promised that if there were ever anything he could do for me , he would . I am here to ask just one thing of him . Please , old friend , be at peace . '' <newline> <newline> And , in spite of everything , I would be . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> This is my first story , I hope that you guys like it , and any feedback would be welcome . <newline>

1,"Note : this is by no means the full story , but an attempt at the opening scene . <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> Grace loved how Mrs Gomez covered her home in nettles . <newline> <newline> For most people who lived on the Ground , it was barbed wire , if you could afford it . Broken glass and nails if you could n't . <newline> <newline> And for the really rich , those who could build their homes from sheets of actual metal and wood , it was electrified wiring and cheap , decades-old identification systems . A retina scanner here , a fingerprint reader there . All for show , of course . Why fake your way past electronic security when a crowbar to the roof would do ? <newline> <newline> But Mrs Gomez ? She had no patience for simply scaring off would-be looters and drifters . Why , the mass of tangled green vines and knife-edge leaves looked almost inviting from the narrow streets of the Ground , each one doused in at least half a metre of rotten food , human sewage , waste and dust . You could almost smell them , the stench of green and growth , amongst the smells of shit , damp mould and the engines of thousands of deafening heat extractors , pulling the late summer scorch from the maze of improvised housing and cramming it into the thin alleys between them . <newline> <newline> But everyone knew Mrs Gomez and her nettles . The weeds , a relic from Fuel Wars , developed by overworked and underpaid government scientists , were far better known as Spreadburn . Catch one edge of one leaf on your finger , and within two hours your whole body would be an angry red , blistering and boiling far below the surface of the skin . <newline> <newline> Which is why you wanted to be on Mrs Gomez 's good side . Her friends were always welcome to a helping of her homemade Spreadburn ointment should they ever visit her humble shack , situated on the old crossroads of 8th and 21st . <newline> <newline> *Still , * thought Grace , as she marched through what could only described as the `` front garden '' of the small pile of cardboard and plastic sheeting . *I 'd rather not take my chances . Again . * <newline> <newline> Her usual get-up was normally enough to stop her getting caught out . Boots about an inch thick on all sides , tops reaching well beyond mid-calf , with the toes still stuffed with her extra pair of socks while she waited to grow into them ; light pants made with a cheap bamboo fabric , held up with a dirty scrap of cloth as a make shift belt , and a light sleeveless tee , that once might have been white . Her makeshift gaiters were made of more scraps of rotting cloth , but she 'd choose an extra few layers between her and the Spreadburn over fashion , any day . <newline> <newline> Not that Sean ever had to worry about little things like Spreadburn , of course . <newline> <newline> `` You know , '' she heard from the familiar voice ahead of her . `` If you 'd worn your jacket , like I told you too , you would n't have to hold your arms above your head like that . You look ridiculous by the way , like some sort of puppet . '' <newline> <newline> `` *C'mon* , Sean . '' she protested . `` It 's August , we 're in New York , and it 's the middle of the day . It 's got ta be at *least* three-fifteen Kelvin out ! '' As if to prove a point , a large bead of sweat escaped her hairline and made its way down Grace 's face , to hang stubbornly at the end of her nose . `` And *you're* not wearing a jacket . '' she tagged on the end , half heartedly . <newline> <newline> `` It 's three-oh-eight , actually . And stop whining , we 've dealt with worse . '' <newline> <newline> `` Buzzkill . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whinger . '' <newline> <newline> `` Dork . '' <newline> <newline> `` *Baby . * '' <newline> <newline> `` *Old Man . * '' <newline> <newline> `` Uncalled for , I 'm only , what , five years older than you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Your *mom's* uncalled for . '' <newline> <newline> Sean only roled his eyes and turned back the the doorway . <newline> <newline> Grace followed her eyes up her bare arms , to her hands hanging above her , in a surrender . Far , far beyond she saw the Levels rise above her . As the buildings of the city clambered and climbed higher and higher , you could see the brick to turn metal , metal turn to glass , glass turn into ... what ever materials they used on the upper Levels . Who even knew ? They were always in the clouds , anyway . Huge gaping walkways between towers swept across the sky , carrying people from community to community , ensuring none of the well-off Levellers ever had to set foot in the dirty , septic streets of the Ground . <newline> <newline> `` ... Nguyen . *NGUYEN ! * '' <newline> <newline> Grace snapped her attention back towards her friend , who now stood by the open door , held by none other than the old crone herself . <newline> <newline> `` We 'll do n't just stand there sweetie , drag your ass in here before I have to myself ! '' <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> This is an unedited first draft , please feel free to drop me some constructive criticism !

1,"He watched , agitated , as they died around him . Family after family . Loved one after loved one . It didn ’ t matter . They would grow old and get sick , always the same . Always by himself at the end . Their deaths lingered in his mind . He wouldn ’ t forget them ; he couldn ’ t forget them . He sat beside their beds as they calmly entered the void . Grasped their ruined frames in the middle of the street . Spent hours pushing upon their chests in a meaningless attempt to get them breathing again . With each small victory , a surfeit of failure was never far away . He could save some but what was the point ? Always the same . At the end of the day , and as years passed , they would perish and he would be left with nothing . He had buried enough children , wives , and husbands . It was too much to bear any longer , no more . It was crucial ; he had to get away . He spent years of his life isolated in a cabin high atop a mountain . He needn ’ t eat , sleep or shit . He exhausted his time staring blindly into nothing . It was just he and the darkness only his cruel memories to keep them company , never again would he get hurt . <newline> <newline> It was chance to blame when the woman came stumbling through his door collapsing to the ground . The sight of her prone body freezing on the hardwood brought tears to his eyes . It ’ s happening again . Quickly he ran to the door , shutting it nearly all the way , leaving only a small crack ajar . The sight of the snow and the harsh glare of the sun was an insufferable blur of light but he would need some of it . She was bundled tightly in her climbing gear , a puffy jacket , thick pants , large boots and gloves on both hands . Yet even wearing all of her equipment the complication was noticeably brutal . You broke your leg . Wickedly her right limb jutted outward from her , his tentative prodding causing her to cry out in pain . Her face was red and weather-beaten ; evidence of frostbite was on her fleshy cheeks . <newline> <newline> “ Please , ” her voice was strained and weak . “ Help… ” <newline> <newline> He had nothing for her . No supplies to wrap the bone and no way to stop the bleeding . There was a bitter truth to her injury — she was better off being dead upon impact . Now she lay doomed on a deranged man ’ s floor . Her blood continued to welter from her leg and spread along the wood flooring . Kneeling beside the woman , his knees soon became saturated by the essence of her dwindling life . <newline> <newline> “ Stay awake — I ’ m going to find you some help , ” he said , though he knew it fruitless . The shine of outside was nauseating ; the cold wind enough to kill any other man . He trampled throughout the desolate landscape for hours upon hours without finding any other sign of civilization . <newline> <newline> Pushing open the door to his secluded cabin , he had long prepared for what was awaiting . She had long since lost the battle for life ; her eyes open and directed toward the doorway . Horrible , dark and accusing . “ You left me to die , ” they silently screamed . And she was right . He had left her for dead . The determination to search for help was fueled by the need to get away — he would not get attached to another , especially one as ill-fated as her . Even so , he wept . Wept as he had so many times before . He wept both for her and for himself . He had known her only a few short minutes but , as he looked at her body , he knew that he had loved her . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry , ” he whispered . <newline> <newline> He wanted to join her . He wished for the relief of death . So many years , so much despair , so many people he wanted to see again . As gently as possible , he reached down and grasped both of her arms ; as he pulled her body along the floor , a thin trail of red followed . He left her outside to be at the mercy of the elements . He propped her body up into a sitting position and directed her head in the direction of sun . She had died in darkness but he would leave her in the light . <newline> <newline> Inside the cabin he barred the door by pushing his dilapidated bed against it . She would not be the last to discover his hidden cabin of purgatory . But to the others he kept his door shut and his ears plugged . No matter the amount they begged , he would not answer . Without failure , the babbling of their pleas would dissipate and expire . He tried his best to imagine them discovering sanctuary elsewhere but that was a false and unrealistic dream . Isolated in his cabin , he celebrated every year that passed without another frantic cry outside his door . Some force refused him death , but — alone in his bed — he could smile . He had discovered a way out . <newline> <newline> *An immortal ’ s suicide . *

1,"The boy wakes up feeling refreshed like he was able to sleep in longer than usual . He does his normal routine of stretches and yawns then walks down the hallway to see his father like he does every morning . Only this morning was n't every other morning . <newline> <newline> `` Hey dad I slept so good . '' <newline> `` Sit down and look at the tv '' <newline> <newline> The boy then sits down and looks at the tv to see something strange . He sees a building burning . <newline> <newline> `` What is this dad . '' <newline> `` Something bad happened . This is in New York . We do n't really know what 's going on right now . You 're not going to go to school today . You 're going to stay with me today . '' <newline> <newline> The father was always frank and upfront with his son . Nothing was ever censored . The ways of the world were always shown for its reality . This may be beneficial if we are talking about sex and curse words , abortions and death . What the boy watched today was something much different . <newline> <newline> `` Why are they jumping out of the windows like that dad ? '' <newline> `` I think it 's too hot in there and they are choosing to die rather than burn . '' <newline> `` You do n't think they can make it to the stairs ? '' <newline> `` I 'm not sure son . '' <newline> <newline> What the boy watched changed the way he looked at the world . The world of Grand Theft Auto video games and mindless early 2000 music videos seemed innocent compared to the stark reality thrust upon the 9 year old boys innocent mind . But on this day the boy did n't realize what he had lost . He was in a panic as much of the rest of the country . The totality of the incident would hit him years later . <newline> <newline> The father grimaced in pain <newline> `` What 's wrong dad ? '' <newline> `` I am having a toothache . We need to go to the dentist . Today is a terrible day but we need to go . '' <newline> <newline> As we jumped in the car the normal sport talk chatter was interrupted by the news . No sports would be talked about on this day . The boy listened in a haze . The boy was becoming immune to the updated death tolls and the speculation about what had happened and why . It 's crazy how fast someone can become desensitized . <newline> <newline> `` Come in and take a seat '' The dentist said . <newline> <newline> The father sat down in the chair . Mounted on a shelve in the top corner above his head was a television . Playing was footage from the attacks . The boy grabbed a rolling chair and sat down . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't think I 'm going to be able to numb this . '' <newline> `` Doc I need to get this done my tooth is killing me , I already took the antibiotics I do n't think it 's going to clear up . '' <newline> `` Do you want me to go ahead and do this ? '' <newline> `` I need it done . '' <newline> <newline> The father had a weird thing about being out to sleep . He was always scared he would wake up in the middle of the procedure . With the mother working no one could give him and the boy a ride home . <newline> <newline> `` I need this done I ca n't take the pain anymore . '' <newline> <newline> The boy was glued to the TV . The images of the people who would rather chose death over pain is what was being replayed in his mind . Death ? In his mind he could n't comprehend this . He told himself in his own childish situations such as a zombie apocalypse he would always try to survive . He would always go out fighting . But that was a fake reality made up in his mind . What he was witnessing on the television was the apocalypse . They chose to jump . <newline> <newline> The boy noticed the father grasping the chair in pain . <newline> <newline> `` I tried to extract the tooth but it snapped in half I 'm going to have to drill it out . '' <newline> <newline> The sound of the drill and the grunts of the father was something the boy had never seen . This reality haunted the boy more than watching people jump out of a burning building . <newline> <newline> The boy rolled close to his father and grabbed his hand . The father made a waving motion . <newline> <newline> `` Hey boy , why do n't you go sit out in the lobby '' The doctor said . <newline> <newline> After a while of sitting in silence . The father came out with an ice pack on his face . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's go . '' <newline> <newline> They arrived home and the father fell asleep in a pain killed induced haze . The boy was left to sit and watch the news . The boy was changed from this day . He looked at things differently . America would never be the same and neither would the boy . I lost my rosebud this day , I lost my innocence . <newline> <newline> I threw this together with no draft or outline . Wanted to write about it and saw this post . Thought it would be cool .

1,"The pitch black sky split open with an earthshattering roar as the waves battered either side of the ship , causing it to lurch violently with every rolling crest . The scattered seamen battled ferociously with the rigging , wild ropes whipping furiously through the air as the wind screeched furiously around them . In the midst of the mayhem , a woman huddled , limbs tied together to the mast ; neither in the way nor helping she whimpered with every sudden pitch and roll of the waves . <newline> <newline> `` She 's bad luck , I 'm telling yer . Why d'you have to bring 'er ? '' Two men shouted to one another over the howling of the wind and the creaking of the ship as she struggled to stay upright in the raging storm . <newline> <newline> `` She i… my si…er , could n't ve.. ell leave … behind …ravaged ….merican savages ! '' Half of his words were lost to the wind 's voice as the deck tilted dangerously to one side . <newline> <newline> `` …El she'll…..ave to… . '' His words were swallowed as he pulled the woman – girl , really- to the railing , casting her , legs still bound , over the side . <newline> <newline> The roaring of the waves , the screeching of the wind and her brother 's broken scream swirled around her as she fell , terrified , into the churning depths below . <newline> <newline> Weighed down by her already sodden skirts , her entire body seemed to shatter from the impact of hitting the freezing water as she was instantly swept under by the rampaging current . She could think of nothing but how damnably cold it was , and how her poor mother was going to take it if only one of her beloved children returned . <newline> <newline> Everything went black as she sank deep into the churning water and the ship continued her laboured journey through the storm . <newline> <newline> She woke to darkness . At least she assumed she woke up . At first she thought she was dead , but the cold had permeated her bones and saturated her skin , her very bones seeming to scream in frozen agony ; nowhere in the bible did it say she would be cold in death . Fire , she had been expecting , burning in eternal damnation had seemed almost pleasant . Throughout her short life , she had been cold . Coal had cost too much , and the lord of the manor would have overlooked it had she been older and more… willing to his advances . <newline> <newline> Hatred swirled through her , hot and heady , warming her chilled , broken bones . The ocean as it swirled around her seemed to whisper to her , encouraging her hatred of the man , spreading warmth from her heart around her body , easing the pain . <newline> <newline> Sorrow touched her as she thought about her mother , left to fend for herself . Whilst her brother cared for her in his way , only she knew what her mother needed and when . Leaving her had been one of the most painful things she had ever done , and it was her brother 's fault that their mother was going to be left alone . <newline> <newline> Thinking of her brother led her to his crew mates . Bastards , the lot of them . They 'd tried to force her , on their first night at sea . She 'd refused , and her brother had come by , hearing her panicked screams as they had forced her legs apart . Anger and malice coursed through her , sending a tingling through her body , from the crown of her head to the very tips of her toes , leaving her painless . <newline> <newline> She experimentally twitched her fingers in front of her , opening her eyes properly . The storm still raged above her , the cresting waves seeming to devour each other greedily as lightning split the sky and illuminated her surroundings . <newline> <newline> She was surrounded . <newline> <newline> A hundred beings hung , transfixed , in the water , just looking at her in her ripped dress , corset in rags and her legs still bound . Their pale , otherworldly skin seemed to glow in the faint light of the lightning , shimmering green and blue in the murky half-light . <newline> <newline> She turned suddenly , flicking her head to the side as the beings glided towards her . Closing her eyes tightly as they drew near , she screamed as their ghostly hands roamed over her broken body , untangling her hair . Softly , their hands caressed her skin , soothing and healing her battered bones , untying her legs and gently removing the remnants of her dress , running their hands down her legs until she felt them meld together . They whispered to her , asking her name and who had caused her such harm . Telling her she could not find her revenge . Whispering that perhaps , perhaps , she might be able to avenge the next girl . <newline> <newline> Her worries faded into nothing as hatred consumed her . Those men ; all men . They were responsible for her death . She knew now , that men were evil . <newline> <newline> They had thrown her to her death . <newline> <newline> Using her pretty face , her haunting , salt roughened voice and the wonderful freedom her tail had given her , she would repay the favour . <newline> <newline> They would suffer as she had suffered . <newline> <newline> She would lure them to their deaths .

1,"Everyone has rules . <newline> <newline> That 's the one truth I 'll dogmatically stick to . The one thing I 'm sure of . Some treat them as routine , some people treat them as mandates from a higher power , some people treat them as vague guidelines - but however they treat them , they do *have* them . <newline> <newline> That 's true of me , too . I treat mine respectfully . Treat them as things that should n't be broken except in the most extraneous of circumstances . Treat them as rules should be treated . <newline> <newline> And the very first rule , the one I will never break - the one I 'd never *want* to break - is : <newline> <newline> *never enjoy the kill . * <newline> <newline> It 's important to be specific here - After all , that 's rule 2 , always be specific . When I say I do n't enjoy the kill , I mean I do n't enjoy the exact moment of pulling the trigger , and watching some poor individual 50 or so miles away suddenly stop thinking about lunch , about their speech , about their political ideals , and start to think about the bit of metal that just flew through their skull and sent their head careening forwards , before the last fleeting glimpses of life end up fading , slowly but surely . <newline> <newline> They *always* go forwards , by the way . Rule 67 - always make sure the head goes forwards . Remember JFK ? Remember `` Back and to the left '' ? Making the head go towards the bullet hole tends to confuse people every now and then . Makes you harder to trace . <newline> <newline> Still , you may wonder why I have that rule . Not rule 67 , rule number 1 - and why it 's number one . Simple . <newline> <newline> You can enjoy the sight of a kill . Enjoy the physics of the situation . Enjoy the domino effect that your little bullet-shaped chaos butterfly can instill in a business , a political party , a religious cult , even a nation . I know I have , every now and then . <newline> <newline> But once you enjoy *the kill itself* , that 's where trouble starts . Killers who start to enjoy the act of killing start to *chase* kills . They start to get dogmatic about chasing kills . They start leaving evidence behind , because they 're so determined to get a kill , they have to have it . <newline> <newline> That gets them caught . Ask my old man . Current residence : Six feet under . Execution for around 92 counts of first degree murder . There were other charges besides - first class assault with a deadly weapon , a few cases of grand theft auto , and some unpaid parking tickets - but the important thing is he died chasing his kill . <newline> <newline> He taught me a lot , though . Including how not to care about his death - that lesson was perhaps unintentional , but it was difficult to tell . My first kill was n't the individuals who caught him , was n't the individuals that testified . It was n't the judge , the jury , or the executioner . I had no reason to kill those individuals besides the fact that they killed my father , and to take those shots would break Rule 43 - Prior Purges Of Personal Partiality Prevents Piss Poor Planning . <newline> <newline> No , it was the individual he was supposed to kill . And I took my time - it was a good month of recon before I even figured out a good time . That was my early days , of course . Rule 3 was created then - Know Your Target . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Let me clarify , before we continue , why this is being written down . My rules have held through thick and thin , constantly propping me up to reach far greater heights then anyone of my profession . I thought it a shame if those rules would simply die with me , but at the same time , I could n't simply write them down in a manual . <newline> <newline> So I decided to tell my stories . Write it like a novel . Muddy facts here and there , perhaps . Thus , if it ever became public , I 'd have the ability to deny it . A personal rule book is a clue - a personal novel is just a nice read . `` It 's related to real events , of course , but that does n't prove that I did them ! '' <newline> <newline> `` So is this just a novel '' , you might ask . Given the context , I can appreciate that it 's hard to tell . Did this book get out after my death ? Did I let it get out ? Do I exist , or not ? Am I , the writer , an actual trained killer , or am I simply thinking like one ? And if I 'm thinking like one , does that mean I *was* one ? Or could be one ? <newline> <newline> Well , my dear reader - I can neither confirm or deny my guilt . Not without ruining either the book or my life . The plain fact is , however , that the information is on a rather need to know basis . <newline> <newline> And if you need to know , well ... Either way , You 'll soon find out .

1,"`` How I Got the Handbook '' <newline> <newline> I stood outside the convenience store , hands stuffed into the pockets of my black hoodie , shifting back and forth from foot to foot . I ’ d dressed down – my oldest , most frayed jeans , the broken down black and orange Asics running shoes I wore to mow the lawn , and my favorite Lamb of God t-shirt . Okay , I hadn ’ t dressed down , but I really felt like I should be smoking or something , just to complete the gas-station-hanger-outer look . <newline> <newline> The buzz of the fluorescent lights bothered me as I watched the aerial bug ballet and waited . The black metal watch on the underside of my wrist told me these jokers were 20 minutes late , which meant one of two things : 1 ) they were temporally challenged , or 2 ) they were waiting to see how patient I was . <newline> <newline> I could answer the latter . Not very . <newline> <newline> This was how these things had gone , however , and it had taken me months to get this far . <newline> <newline> An '80s era IROC rolled into the lot , its metallic blue paint faded in splotches like a skin condition . But hey , at least the louvers and t-tops were mint . Sounded like lifters were shot , though . It looped around the parking lot before rolling to a stop next to me . <newline> <newline> A guy with a scraggly , patchy beard and gaunt face looked up at me . Joker , then . Singular . His eyes were prominent . He reminded me of that character on Game of Thrones who lost his willy to the psycho . The show , not the books . <newline> <newline> “ You him ? ” He asked . I imagined , for a moment , he was pointing a gun at me through the door , because , yeah , that ’ s the kind of paranoid I am . <newline> <newline> “ You have it ? ” <newline> <newline> “ We ’ re here to take you to Ma . She ’ s got it. ” <newline> <newline> We ’ re ? Of course , of course you want me to get into your Camaro with you and your imaginary friend and go with you to parts unknown with no back-up . I mean , yes , I had my phone , but I still had no back-up . Then again , who the hell was I going to call ? <newline> <newline> “ How long ’ s it going to take ? ” <newline> <newline> His hands clasped the wheel at the 10-and-2 . He flexed his fingers open and gazed out the windshield . <newline> <newline> “ Look ‘ ere . You want the thing or don ’ t you ? If you do , get in . Ma don ’ t travel , and she don ’ t let anyone else handle the things . You come with us or forget it . ‘ Sides , what ’ re you worried about ? This ain ’ t Deliverance. ” <newline> <newline> I waited a minute , looked around . Fuck . <newline> <newline> He tapped on the steering wheel . Tap , tap , tap , tap … <newline> <newline> “ What ’ s it gon na be ? ” <newline> <newline> I walked around the front of the car , opened the passenger door , and dropped into the seat , which felt about as old as it looked . The driver stomped on the gas , lighting up the tires , and squealed out of the lot . He straightened out on the two-lane and opened it up a bit . It felt a little better running wide open than it had sounded in the parking lot , which told me he liked to drive cars , not work on them . <newline> <newline> He reached out with a bony hand and turned on the stereo . Some warbling country music blared out of the speakers . <newline> <newline> I flicked my eyes sideways , checking the driver out without being obvious about it . There was a gun jammed between his hip and the center console . Motherfuc … <newline> <newline> “ You always carry ? ” <newline> <newline> His head whipped my way , then back to the road . He reached down and patted the back of the gun , almost a caress . <newline> <newline> “ You don ’ t ? ” <newline> <newline> I looked out the window . Twilight was bleeding off to full dark and I had no idea where we were going . It didn ’ t bother me much . After a minute , I answered . “ Don ’ t need to , usually. ” <newline> <newline> “ You think you not havin ’ one ’ s going to make me not shoot you ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Are you planning on shooting me ? ” <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s not what I ’ m sayin ’ . But do you ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Do I what ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Think I wouldn ’ t shoot you. ” <newline> <newline> I turned toward him . “ I ’ m saying I don ’ t need one. ” <newline> <newline> ( continued ? ) ( Sorry . Have n't posted before . Not sure about the formatting )

1,"Gift <newline> <newline> <newline> When I wake up , the sound of engines has faded to nothing . The ship is silent , and I am half a trillion miles from Earth . <newline> <newline> I step out , hoping briefly that my colleagues have woken too . They haven ’ t . Anna will sleep for another year , Sora another decade . The solitude is unnerving , though I can see their calm faces sleeping behind glass windows . The circular room , dark except for the faint light spilling from my chamber , is still , motionless , like a paused film . <newline> <newline> I push forward , gliding steadily towards the only exit . None of the parabolic flight or underwater training with ESA has prepared me for the liberation of weightlessness as I reach for the railing . More disorientating than falling , here “ up ” is meaningless and all I need to do is press against a stark grey wall to propel myself along the corridor . <newline> <newline> At last I reach the main control room . <newline> <newline> “ Ben. ” My voice catches . “ Bring up vitals on Doctors Dubronsky and Bak. ” <newline> <newline> To the left a monitor whirrs into life . Quickly I approach the screen : vitals nominal . <newline> <newline> “ We all made it… ” I breathe in relief . We had all entered the program knowing that any of the chambers could malfunction ; that any of us could have died in stasis . <newline> <newline> As I check each system in turn , the flashing date in the corner of the screen catches my eye . 2098-09-21 04:26 UET . Ten years , as planned , have slipped by as I slept . Now my sister is older than me . Perhaps my parents are dead… <newline> <newline> A notification appears without warning . <newline> <newline> “ Data stream incoming… likelihood of data corruption… 0.35 per cent. ” The synthetic voice feels unnaturally loud in the silence . I am curious , if not surprised . <newline> <newline> “ Play message , ” I whisper . <newline> <newline> At once the video starts . A tall man , possibly Chinese , is stood in front of a white screen ; I do not recognise him . <newline> <newline> “ This message , broadcast on frequency 6.28 gigahertz , transmitted at twenty-two hundred hours to the Venture . Dr Harding , congratulations and well-wishes are given from everyone on Earth for you and your team ’ s continued safety and exploration. ” <newline> <newline> It hits me after a moment ; this man is my age . When I stepped into the cryo-chamber , he was fifteen , just a teenager . <newline> <newline> “ Following is a message from Professor Laura Slattery , née Harding. ” <newline> <newline> The smiling face of my once-kid sister grins impishly from the screen . A toddler is sitting on her knee , staring curiously out . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s been ten years for me , big brother . Got ta be so bizarre to see me here older than you ever were- ” She pauses . “ I miss you every day . But , you know , life goes on , right ? Finished my PhD - that ’ s more than you did . Got married. ” Laughing , she waves her hand in front of the screen , a gold band glinting under the light . “ I think you met Matthew once , at the Marseilles conference , remember ? I reckon you ’ d ’ ve liked him. ” She looks down for a moment . “ And here ’ s our son , our baby boy . You ’ re an uncle. ” The baby - my nephew - wriggles impatiently in Laura ’ s arms . “ His name is James. ” <newline> <newline> Suddenly I ’ m crying . The tears stick to my face , neither falling or floating in the weightless room . <newline> <newline> Laura ’ s still smiling , somehow . “ I know that next time you wake up , I ’ ll be dead . And so will James . Just don ’ t forget us , please . Remember where you came from , because you ’ re our gift to the universe . Goodbye , James . I love you. ” <newline> <newline> The screen flickers off . More messages will be incoming . I should record my own . I know that after today I can never talk to her again . <newline> <newline> But she ’ s happy . <newline> <newline> That ’ s enough . <newline> <newline> Shivering , I make my way to the observation deck , leaving my tears in the air behind me . Even with the telescope , all I see is a pinprick of blue-white light hanging in the dark . Is this view something ESA is recording ? Eventually I return to the stasis room , and climb slowly back into the chamber . Perhaps I will never wake up again . If I do , millennia will have passed and I can ’ t know that anyone will be there waking up beside me . <newline> <newline> But as the glass lid closes on me , I know for the first time that every moment of every day has been a gift worth dying for . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I wake up .

1,"Wrote this in my freshman year of high school last year and never finished it . Sorry if it is n't the best . <newline> <newline> Edit : Sorry about font and formatting errors , posting on mobile . <newline> <newline> The Swarm <newline> ___ <newline> <newline> From around the corner in the blackness of night there was a snarl , like the snarl of a wolf who had just found his next meal . As he crept around the dark corner he was stunned as he felt claws digging into his sides and felt a slam on his chest . Later in that night on the news there were reports of thousands of incidents like these happening all over the world and nobody knew what they were . One case happened underneath a street light and a witness saw a flash of purple during the attack . Nobody knew what was happening to the world and nothing could have prepared them for what was to come . <newline> <newline> During the next morning some explorers started finding these weird flesh-like grounds where deserts used to be . The ground in these areas seemed to be made up of veins and a scaly mesh beneath . When these grounds were walked on people said they could feel vibrations coming from below , as if the ground had a beating heart . <newline> <newline> Throughout the day , multiple sightings of giant gaping maws sprouting out of the ground and the maws seemed to convert the nearby soil into the “ creep ” substance . Upon further investigation it seemed that the maws contained tunnels . Within the tunnels the explorers experienced much resistance from small , dog-like creatures with claws and fangs as sharp as kunais . <newline> <newline> During the following night , not a soul was sleeping as the ground pulsated like a giant heart was pumping in the very core of the Earth . This , of course , was not the case ; it was far worse . As the night dragged on people came to realize that the attacks were only happening at night . The people had started to form a resistance and were holding the lines of their city borders . <newline> <newline> During the next day the pulsing coming from within the Earth grew more and more violent as the day went on . Explorer teams were sent to venture inside of the tunnels with protection so that the humans could find the correct place to strike . They were never heard from again . Production of nuclear missiles had begun in order to dispatch of the new scourge . <newline> <newline> New laws were being placed to protect the cities from collapsing due to lack of resources . These laws changed the lifestyle of many for worse , and many for better . One of the laws stated that all humans must consume the same amount of resources per day . Due to the lack of knowledge of the new threat some of the laws put in place screening processes for people to be even considered human . <newline> <newline> During the following night the pulsing grew so violent that some of the structures began to fall and crumble to the ground . The attacks on the borders had become so harsh that the human ’ s borders were shrinking at alarming rates . At one point during the night there was a rumbling beneath the ground underneath a major city . Unlike the pulsing , this rumbling was much quieter , but sounded like something was being shoved forcefully through the Earth . <newline> <newline> The pulsing continued throughout about half of the next day , but then it suddenly stopped . All of the pulsing , everywhere on the Earth , just suddenly stopped , gone in the blink of an eye . This , of course , terrified some people and excited others . The terrified people were worried that the pulsing was the sound of the enemy working and it stopping signals that they are finished . The humans who were excited , were excited that they finally could sleep and the buildings would stop falling . Both of these feelings were justified . <newline> <newline> The following evening the screening processes of finding humans was made to be a lot harsher and included DNA tests to even be considered remotely human . After these rules were put in place the humans realized that their newfound enemy was actually sending human-like creatures back in place of their explorers in order to spy on them . <newline> <newline> During the next night , the humans were extremely tense and their borders were very tightly packed with guns and defense squads , but not a single bullet was fired throughout the night . The defense squads were very suspicious of one another because of the lack of attacks . Some of the people even started to fight other people because they were suspicious that others were actually their enemies . <newline> <newline> During the following morning , a rumble was felt throughout the Earth for about five minutes straight then stopped abruptly . A few hours later these small , triangular creatures with claws started to scratch at the bunkers on the edges of cities and they came in waves . After further investigation the humans found out that the small creatures were being flung from these huge flying creatures which seems to produce them , the smaller creatures expire after a few minutes . <newline> <newline> <newline>

1,"I wrote this when I was 16 . It 's unfinished , does n't really even have an ending . I honestly doubt anyone will read this but I 'm going to leave it here anyways . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The birds began awakening and started chirping in unison , creating a soothing melody . Soon after , the sun slowly rose above the frosted mountains , beaming through the gaps in the old wooden shutters . I quietly crept inside the bedroom , adorned in my black and white cleaning attire . It was the first day on the job and I absolutely despised that I was required to wear a typical maid outfit . I passed by a filthy mirror and glanced over , looking at my outfit and sighed . I clutched a filthy feather duster in my left hand and silently placed it on the worn bedside table which sat right next to the massive king sized bed . I continued forward holding in a giggle then suddenly burst the shutters open , attempting to wake up the lump under the layer of quilts and throw-overs from its peaceful slumber . A small payback for requiring me to don such silly clothing . The outdated room was completely flooded by the white light , creating a scene that was actually quite picture perfect . <newline> <newline> An explosive yawn erupted from under the cosy pile of blankets that were messily draped over the object resting underneath . “ Rise and shine ” I sung in a cheerful tone . The mound of blankets flopped to the floor with a faint thud . Along with the bedspreads and sheets , an empty beer bottle collapsed to the floor as well . With a crashing clank it forcefully fell to the ground , shattering into many menacing pieces of glass , radiantly glimmering due to the effect of the bright orb in the pale blue sky above . <newline> <newline> They threateningly lay scattered about on the ground ; just waiting for a victim to place their vulnerable skin atop it , easily and agonizingly slicing the thin layer of tissue coating one ’ s body . I jumped into action just in time to avoid that tragic scenario from taking place . I retrieved the dust pan from the musty closet then proceeded to kneel on the ground and with a disappointing scowl began sweeping up the spiky mess . <newline> <newline> As I dumped the glass into the rubbish bin , a pair of perfectly aligned hooves plopped themselves down on the newly polished floor boards . I was astounded and raised a shaky hand to my mouth which was left agape . Attached to the hooves was an abundance of luxuriant flowing fur the colour of fresh snow fallen from gloomy storm clouds on the eve of Christmas . Near the bottom of its torso , the hair began to disperse . Looking upwards was the rest of its body . A sun kissed six-pack steadily rose and fell with every breath . His face was like no other ; he had a perfectly chiselled jawline and prominent cheek bones . His nose was ideally symmetrical . Glancing down a bit resting beneath his nose laid fully plump lips tinted the colour of a ripe pomegranate . His long black eyelashes framed his eyes which were a beautiful shade of light green , piercing through my frayed soul . Finally , was a head full of curly black locks . Stunningly handsome , to the point of pure intimidation . <newline> <newline> I slowly slumped to the floor , my mind a muddled mess , confused as to what I was seeing and how it was at all possible . He smirked , obviously amused by my bewildered and awe-struck expression . Without a word he rose to his hooves and sauntered out of the room , clattering and clomping with each step . I watched as he went , completely paralyzed with panic but the feeling soon morphed into utter amazement and wonder . I could hear him plodding in the hallway and descend down the staircase . The fact that the floors were wooden made each step he took that much more loud and powerful . <newline> <newline> I remained on the floor for what felt like hours but was probably only minutes . It was as if the world just completely flipped upside down in a matter of seconds , everything I thought I once knew did n't matter anymore . So many questions flooded my mind . If this ... thing exists what else was out there ? My mind just could n't handle what I saw , as if it was n't meant to be seen by mere human eyes . I began making up excuses and reasoning with myself that I must have imagined it , I hallucinated because it just was not possible . <newline> <newline> This was like something out of a child 's fairytale book . No matter how much I tried to think rationally , I failed . For I knew exactly what I saw . It was inhuman and a mystic presence surrounded it and no matter how dreadful I felt I somehow still had a mixed emotion of reverence and respect even though I did n't want to . I fully knew I was in the presence of a divine being and I needed to get out of this house . Now .

1,"Something matters or Nothing matters ( Sorry if it 's too long ) <newline> <newline> “ Are you going to be late ? ” she asks me while jotting down the last of her notes . I turn on my phone and the time is 7:45 Pm . “ The extra credit meeting doesn ’ t start until 8:00 Pm , I have 15 minutes left so I think I ’ m going to be okay. ” I replied . She hops off of my bed and proceeds to put away her notes and school supplies . After she finished , she begins to put on her boots and outerwear while I start putting on my coat and shoes also . While tying her boots she stops and turns her head towards me . “ You sure you don ’ t want me to drive you ? It ’ s a little cold and snowy outside and I ’ m heading that way anyw- “ “ No no no , it ’ s fine , ” I interrupted . “ Your job meeting is more time sensitive , so I honestly don ’ t want you to be late for that. ” She shrugs and finishes tying her other shoe . “ Alright , I ’ ll see you sometime this week then and please don ’ t get sick , we really need to work on the project for Psychology , it ’ s due Friday. ” She heads out my dorm door and I wait until hear her footsteps fade in the corridor to start putting my outerwear and shoes on . I walk outside to see her just drive off out of vision ; it was very snowy and little bit slippery because of the rain yesterday . I begin to walk down the barely visible walkway all the way to the main campus building . For some reason , the whiteness of both in front and behind me made me think of something : <newline> <newline> Nothing really matters . <newline> <newline> It 's probably a thought that each one of us has every now and again but for some odd reason I delve deeper into that thought and stopped walking entirely . When I say nothing really matters , I do n't think it 's negative nor a cry for help but rather I think it 's more of a positive thing ; we 're free to do whatever in our life with the only exception of death being in the way . Is death bad then if when nothing matters is good ? I do n't think that either , it is going to happen to all of us eventually or at least we have n't found a supposed cure for the supposed illness . <newline> Would immortality be the best choice for me ? No , I do n't think so . It looks good as a long and I mean a looong short term goal but long for long term , I can not fathom it , sooner or later , I 've would 've done it all as much as I could . I 'd like to see what waits after this life . Would there be an Afterlife ? I do n't know , I ca n't be 100 % either way , I 'd hope that there is . Does hope work or is it that you 've lucked out , I 'd like to think it 's the former but I do n't have concrete evidence either . <newline> <newline> My nose is met with a subtle kiss of a single snowflake and I 'm reminded how much I love how quiet snow falls and how much a group of single snowflakes can make an impact in a environment . Love , have I felt it yet ? I had a girlfriend and we lasted for a little over a year but is that what I felt being with her ? I liked being around her but we did n't last because she apparently `` loved '' me too much . She let her grades fall and lose sleep over me but honestly I 'd prefer her to love herself like she `` loved '' me . We do n't talk anymore , I caused that , I think I hate her . <newline> <newline> No I do n't . <newline> <newline> I do n't even hate her for what she did , she took me for granted but I did let her do that in order to keep the relationship together . Do I hate myself ? No , but I do n't think I love myself either , I think I 'm content only with my existence . Then again , I 'm content with everything ; I can not remember the last time I was actually happy . <newline> <newline> Will I ever be happy again ? I 'd hope so ... <newline> <newline> Will I ever be happy again with someone else ? I hope so also . I wonder if I could be happy with my psychology class partner . She 's cute and we get long pretty well . Would there be a psychological reason to find out if we are or can be ? <newline> <newline> Psychology ? We we 're studying but I had to stop it short becaus- oh shit . <newline> <newline> I checked my phone , It 's 8:15 . <newline> <newline> I 'm late for the extra credit meeting ! I 'm running towards the main campus and I turn around and notice that my where I was standing is deep but slowly fills up with the quiet snow until it 's barely visible . <newline> <newline> Will I remember this ? Does this really even matter ? <newline> <newline> `` Probably Not , '' I audibly replied to myself and continue running towards the campus . <newline> <newline> The wind begins to blow hard and breaks the silence of the snow . <newline> <newline> TL ; DR : It does n't matter unless it does matter ? <newline> <newline>

1,"WARNING : will be shorter than most . No real plot either , just a 'day in the life ' story . Set in the SVU-verse and the *Eyes Turned Skyward* universe . <newline> <newline> May 1995 <newline> <newline> Most days , Billie Wakefield woke up with a dry feeling in her mouth . No worries : Dr.Yarbrough at the Big Mesa Clinic had told her that that situation was normal to most , if not *all* , pregnant women . Billie was 5 months along . <newline> <newline> At 7 every morning , Billie , Liz , Jessica , Nina , and Alex ate breakfast at the Box Tree Café on Hillcrest Drive,25 minutes from campus . Billie always ordered French toast , scrambled eggs , and regular milk . *Always* . The girls would usually talk shop . Boys , shopping , clothes , Billie 's pregnancy , that hot new TA in American History , and ( when Byron came sometimes ) Star Trek : TNV . <newline> <newline> Billie 's morning classes were American History , Film Criticism 101 , and a linguistics elective in Patman North . These were easier than you 'd expect and gave her time to think . To gather energy for the rest of the day and beyond , energy she would need when the twins were little . <newline> <newline> At 12 noon , Billie met Steven , Mike , Byron , and Bruce for lunch at Joe 's Ristorante , one of the campus 's few restaurants . Billie 's usual order was the *tostada* with buttercream and marinara sauce , and Grampa Geno 's Famous apple cider to drink . <newline> <newline> Billie 's afternoon classes were similarly easy . Sociology gave her more time to think , to listen to Professor Lannister , one of the shortest guys in the state , talk about how the Cold War had affected the thinking of youth . Billie always loved it when Mr.Lannister recited another anecdote about his father , a famous tank commander in Vietnam . Appreciation of Music helped her in a practical way , because Dr.Yarbrough had told her that her twins could hear the music even though they were still in her belly . Comparative Data Analysis was something Billie could 've done without , but Ned Wakefield had recommended it . He said that he 'd taken a similar class at Michigan State , and it had been 'cool ' . Besides , what young bride wants to get into her father-in-law 's bad graces ? Although truth be told , Ned did love her . After all , when she and Steven had gotten married in December , he 'd been the second person , after Steven himself , to dance with her . <newline> <newline> At 6:30 PM , Billie , Liz , Steven , and Todd met for dinner at Casey 's Place , which was catty-corner to the eastern campus gate . For dinner , Billie always ordered hot dogs , mac and cheese , pickles , and water . And for dessert , pound cake with a Granny Smith apple on top , a Casey 's special since 1963 . <newline> <newline> After that , Billie finished up her day with an hour in the Daeron Dayne Library . Usually , she 'd transcribe her notes and study for tomorrow . Then she would go home , ( which meant the Western Dormitory , Edros Tully Memorial Wing , ) shower , brush her teeth , change into that baby blue shift with the sunflowers , and fall asleep in Steven 's arms , knowing that the same routine would continue for at least another couple of months . Which meant , of course , that life was good . <newline> <newline> *Finis*

2,"Today she was at the counter , the soft clicks and snaps indicating that she was cutting vegetables . Mitschu hesitated briefly , calculating his odds , and decided to take the risk . He timed pulling his blade out of the holster to the sound of her cutting , one snick buried among the rest , and held it ready . He lifted one foot silently off the ground , inched it forward , set it back down gently ... <newline> <newline> `` If you ever want to make it as an Air Adept , you 're going to have to learn to stop moving around so loudly . '' She commented abruptly to the air . Mitschu swore under his breath . She continued blandly , `` If you ever want to make it as a Cursing Adept , you 're going to have to learn to stop cursing so loudly . '' <newline> <newline> `` Sorry , mom . '' He sighed , putting his knife away . <newline> <newline> `` If you ever want to make it as a Fire Adept ... uh ... something about not giving up so easily . Just pretend I said something insightful . '' His father intoned behind him , entering the room blearily . `` Good morning everyone ... hon , could you heat this up for me ? '' He held out his morning coffee beseechingly . <newline> <newline> She took his proffered cup , placing it on top of the stove perfunctorily and lighting the burner with a quick twist . He eyed it bemusedly . `` I coulda done that ... '' <newline> <newline> `` You could have . '' She agreed cheerily , returning to her chopping . <newline> <newline> `` And I could do that ... '' He offered . She passed him the knife , stepping back to give him room at the counter . <newline> <newline> He held it speculatively before firmly thunking it down into the cutting board , burying it a few inches deep into the cheap wood . His finger began to glow , a crisp , cloudy white . He inspected the finger , then nodded in satisfaction and began flicking it at the vegetable . The room was again filled with the sounds of cutting . <newline> <newline> `` Dear ... '' she began in exasperation . `` You 're ruining the board . Besides that , we 're trying to teach Mitschu respect for moderation , remember ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , sure , but today he starts at the College . Our part of the training is done . The little boy is all grown up . Now he gets to see how powerful his old man and lady really are , so that he does n't come home with his first cantrip and think he can bedazzle us with his raw , overwhelming power . '' <newline> <newline> She raised an eyebrow . `` Oh yes , indeed . So very powerful and focused . Are you going to quit cutting anytime soon , or are we having mashed vegetables with cutting board slivers on the side for dinner ? '' She gestured to the remains of the aforementioned board pointedly , making him flinch in embarrassment . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , I have n't had my coffee yet ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Fine , if it 'll keep you from turning my countertop into a crossword puzzle , I 'll get you your damn coffee . '' She turned to Mitschu , winking . `` But only because I do n't want our kid to go to school without knowing what real power and focus is . '' <newline> <newline> She examined the beverage sitting on the stove from a short distance , taking in the shape and size of it , before nodding firmly and raising a finger in the air . It began to flicker with a pale rose color , concentrated above the tip . She tapped the cup gently with her extended digit . From that brief contact , the ceramic glowed red , and shortly after , the liquid inside began bubbling and steaming , spilling out over the side . <newline> <newline> `` Coffee 's done . '' She chirped . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , but now it 's too hot to drink ... '' <newline> <newline> She threw her hands up . `` No pleasing you , is there ... '' He placatingly dropped an arm over her shoulder , hugging her in close . She craned her neck up , grinning into his face . <newline> <newline> Mitschu watched this display of parental affection with barely contained disgust . When it looked like they were about to kiss , he coughed , loudly . They kissed anyway , before turning to him with matching expressions of polite inquiry on their faces . <newline> <newline> `` Anyway ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Anyway nothing , are you ready for school ? Bag packed ? Supplies ready ? Did you sharpen your dagger ? '' She began going down a checklist , pausing to double check a few suspicions . Finally , she begrudgingly acceded that he was ready . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't come rushing home for dinner , either . The school has a huge library and massive training grounds , I want you to put in at least an hour of extra study before running back here . '' <newline> <newline> `` Jeez , you act like you ca n't wait to get rid of me . '' Mitschu grumbled , put off . <newline> <newline> `` Yep . '' Both parents confirmed automatically . His father added , `` We 've been supervising you every day for eleven years , now . Wake up , eat breakfast without as much as a thank you , beat up the neighbor 's kid , chase the cat around trying to set it on fire , trying to assassinate your mother every morning ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey ! You told me to ! You said , 'training begins the moment your eyes first open and only ends when they close forever , ' and that I should wake up every morning ready to fight for my life . Hell , mom once set my bed on fire because I overslept ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , '' he conceded with a grin , `` I remember , I was there fanning the flames . Tell me , have you overslept since ? '' <newline> <newline> `` ... no . '' <newline> <newline> `` Exactly ! '' <newline> <newline> Mitschu growled obscenities under his breath . His father tilted his head , trying to pick up on the litany of outraged insults . <newline> <newline> `` He 's saying fuck a lot , and damn , and used the word cocksucker to describe you in a way that almost made me chuckle . '' His mother supplied , knowing that her hearing was better than his . It was an ironic joke , that the Air Adept with the title Master of the Faintest Breeze would be partially hard of hearing . <newline> <newline> `` Ah . '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't use language like that at school , now , no matter how inventively . Frankly , your father and I do n't give a shit , but they 're a little more prudish at College . '' <newline> <newline> Mitschu acknowledged this last advice with a curt nod , still irritated , and headed over to the doorway . `` What time should I leave if I want to arrive on time ? '' He asked idly . <newline> <newline> `` Well , when it was me , a few decades ago , I woke up fifteen minutes earlier and had already left by now , and still arrived just barely in time . Even if you have your father give you a sprinter 's boost , you 're probably going to miss your first class at eighth hour . '' <newline> <newline> He yelped in a panic . `` But I read ... tenth hour ... I read that damn schedule at least a dozen ... oh , **fuck . ** '' He bolted out the door . <newline> <newline> `` Have a good first day at school , sweetie ! '' His mother called out to his fleeing back , arms crossed in smug satisfaction as he faded into the distance . <newline> <newline> `` ... That was kind of mean , dear . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , but look on the bright side , if he keeps up that pace the whole way , he should get to school with an hour to spare before his first lesson . Socializing with his peers is an important lesson , too . Knowing him , if I did n't give him a push , he 'd just arrive at the last possible moment , sit in the back of the class , and silently absorb everything around him for the rest of the day . At least now , depending on how he reacts when he finds out , he 'll have an amusing anecdote to share with his new friends . '' <newline> <newline> They both stared at the empty road in companionable silence for a time , worrying over their little boy without admitting that they were in the least bit worried . `` Do you think he knows yet ? '' His father asked suddenly . <newline> <newline> `` Hm ... oh , his element ? I do n't think so . He 's clever , but not particularly smart . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , but ... well , he understands the theory just fine . Magineology and all that . And even if he never added his own information to the lesson and figure it from there , every time I 've caught him trying to manifest , it was the same . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , did I miss his first manifesting ? I thought he was just a late bloomer . '' <newline> <newline> His father laughed . `` A bit of both . It was about a week ago the first time , and he 's been at it every day since trying to get it to stay . White in color , brighter than my own and with a certain *intensity* to it , but flickering and dancing like yours . '' He paused . `` Actually , I think 'crackling ' is a better word . '' <newline> <newline> `` It makes sense . That 's what Fire and Air born children normally end up with . Were you able to gauge how powerful he is from it ? '' She giggled . `` Or is that too rude to ask ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Very rude , dear . '' He kissed her forehead emphatically . `` You absolutely should *never* try to measure another Adept 's power unless you 're engaged in combat with them . Plus , he could n't keep it active long enough for me to get a reading . '' <newline> <newline> She swatted his arm playfully , before leaning into him in relaxed contentment . `` So ... we have the house to ourselves now , for the first time in eleven years ... '' <newline> <newline> She stared up at him with doe eyes . `` Do you wan na fight me ? '' <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Mitschu paused at the top of the mountain , taking in the overlook view of the school . He glanced one last time behind him , eyes straining to pick out his own house in the far distance , momentarily homesick . A sudden spiraling tornado of flame shot up , dwarfing the small speck that was his house and indicating it for him , and reminding him why he had been so eager to wake up and get going this morning . <newline> <newline> `` Jeez , mom . Dad . Get a room . '' He turned back to the school , noting that the clock on the tower read ninth and a half . He had , of course , fished his schedule out of his bag while running , and reconfirmed for the thirteenth time that his first class was at tenth hour . Still , that initial panicked burst of speed had ensured he make good time . If he walked from here on , he should get to class right as the first bell rang . He began descending the hill , finger idly brushing his dagger , excited that at long last he would learn his element and begin training in it . <newline> <newline> He was n't sure yet if he wanted to be a Fire Adept or Air Adept . Or possibly another , he remembered his father making pointed pauses during one early lesson about how children born to mixed elements could end up as another element entirely . `` Hey mom , hey dad , I 'm a Water Adept , surprise ! '' he issued to the air experimentally . He imagined that 'd certainly shock them , and dismiss eleven years of eager expectations that he 'd be just like one of them someday . In fact - <newline> <newline> `` Oh awesome , me too ! '' <newline> <newline> He launched forward , almost leaping off the mountain , at the sudden piping voice behind him .

2,"The longest part of every journey was always the last couple million miles . It ’ s not that it felt like it was the slowest , the Odyssey was literally travelling slower at this point . The Odyssey had been accelerating for almost all of the journey . The plan was once the Odyssey reached the Jupiterian system , it would use Io and europa to partially slow before aerobraking in Jupiter ’ s atmosphere . Odyssey had to slow down before reaching Jupiter ’ s atmosphere , or else in order to stay within the system Odyssey would have to plunge so far into the atmosphere that it would be crushed by the pressure . Odyssey was going to have to make multiple passes to slow down enough to make it the first moon on Odyssey ’ s itinerary , Callisto . Even though the crew could see Callisto for a few weeks it would still be months before the first scheduled landing . In the time it took for Odyssey to reach Jupiter there was very little to do . The crew of 14 knew everything about each other . They knew where each sisters were going to college , they knew everybody 's step father ’ s list of allergies , they even knew each other 's prefered shampoo ( but that ’ s because NASA only sent one type of shampoo ) . Of course this is to be expected when the mission totals thirteen years , and they still had seven to go . Other than talking , working out , and watching 43-minute old news , the only thing to do was run diagnostics of the ship ’ s various systems . <newline> <newline> Ray Larson was the ship ’ s life support specialist and resident Lord of the rings expert . Currently the Odyssey ’ s nitrogen sensor wasn ’ t working properly . The ship was detecting that there was no more Nitrogen left in storage . In order to keep the ship at 1 atm the life support system back filled all compartments with pure oxygen . Immediately all crew evacuated to the nearest airlock . All except Ray and his friend that can never take anything seriously ( including this ) Robert Nellis .

2,"Borrado Zacatecas Mexico could hardly be called a community . More a vast expanse of hills and deserts , dotted by little farms and struggling vineyards , with the closest neighbor being fifty miles in either direction . Your connections were limited to those you lived with . It was a harsh shift from the more urban centers of the country , a shift necessitated and demanded by Maria ’ s mother and father when they left them to go north . <newline> <newline> “ You will be safer with your aunt. ” She hated her aunt . Her aunt often returned the sentiment . <newline> <newline> “ You will be closer to us. ” Several hundred miles could hardly be considered close . <newline> <newline> “ The air is making your brother sick. ” He was faking it . <newline> <newline> “ We need to leave now , we can ’ t waste time like this. ” They say as they waste time going out every night . <newline> <newline> “ No more crying , you are coming . '' She cried because she had her first kiss the day before learning when they would depart . <newline> <newline> “ Now Maria ! ” Why not before that kiss ! ? <newline> <newline> “ We will be back. ” No they wont . <newline> <newline> ‘ How quickly they changed their tone from one of care and love to their selfish desire to escape . To leave them behind . Forcing them to abandon their lives and friends for nothing . While they went off to have everything. ’ The young girl ’ s thoughts swirled in dark contempt as she wasted her break from daily chores of cleaning , sweeping , and harvesting . Her brother spent this time more economically . Crafting a little fort in the dry river bed that snaked around the hill their new home rested upon . His construction efforts were assisted by a crew of imaginary workmen , supplied with the best dry branches and shrub grass the land could provide . She watched him work from her little perch upon a rock on the shore of the river bed . <newline> <newline> The little foreman barked his orders at an imaginary crane that was preparing to add the second story to the fort . His hand pointing and jabbing in this direction and that , Maria ’ s eyes focusing on the bruised and cut flesh of his small digits . Her contempt grew , now focused on their aunt that worked them day in and day out . In frustration her hands flew up , with cut up pieces of shrub grass raining over her and the surrounding construction site . <newline> <newline> “ Where is mom and dad ? ” The construction foreman now turned child asked , his workers off on a lunch break . <newline> <newline> She hated how easily and quickly he could flit in and out of his imaginary world . How he could forget the work they had to suffer and the abandonment they endured . Maria pushed herself off her rock perch and scuffed up a cloud of dust and dirt as she landed . Her contempt turned back on her and she peered into a mirror where she saw herself and what she was becoming . Despite hating the image , of a young girl furious with everyone and everything around her , she couldn ’ t stop herself . <newline> <newline> “ America. ” she answered , hiding the contempt for another moment . <newline> <newline> “ Why ? ” <newline> <newline> “ To get a better life. ” <newline> <newline> “ For us ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Of course. ” she forced herself to sound assured , to give her brother the inevitable image that they would once again be reunited . In the distance a bell rang , the signal their aunt always used to call them in from the fields for dinner . She ignored it . She always ignored it until in frustration their aunt stalked out over the hills or into the fields to find them . Her brother never seemed to mind the extended break time that Maria arranged for them . The young foreman also saw more time to get the last bit of work in on the fort . He made some grand declaration that they needed to be quick , as the enemy was approaching and was a day away . The enemy was always a day away . <newline> <newline> The bell rang once more , but it was softer and right in Maria ’ s ear . Following the bend and curve of the dry river bed , the beast lumbered . Around its neck a collar fashioned of leather and chain , a small golden bell hanging right below its throat . With ever heavy step , the bell swung back and forth and sounded out its approach . Maria stepped back and let the beast pass , admiring the splotches of white and black that colored its body . It reminded her of something from the times before her mother and father left . Happy dancing cows on milk cartons . <newline> <newline> The cow ’ s tail flicked as it came before the fort in the river . The bell went silent as it stared at this obstacle , the fort ’ s workmen and defenders turning to meet the beast . <newline> <newline> “ The enemy has arrived ! Load the cannons ! Load the cannons ! ” her brother declared , jumping up and down within the confines of his defenses . The cow , with little regard for strategic military emplacements or their imaginary firepower , slowly lumbered its way around the fort . Her brother was clearly annoyed as the battle was delayed for another day but he quickly rallied his spirits less the other workmen and defenders saw his own contempt . <newline> <newline> Maria could not help but laugh at the odd sight . The laugh was a foreign sound , it choked in her throat and was interrupted by yet another bell . She expected her aunt to lumber her self around the bend of the dry river bed but instead another beast appeared . Much like the former , its body was painted white and black with udders hanging down to the dirt and a bell tied to chain and leather . But its step was off . Something was wrong . Each clang of the bell was followed by a deep huff , air sucked into its lungs quickly expelled with snot and spittle dripping out of its nose and mouth . <newline> <newline> The beast ’ s glassy eyes fell upon the newly constructed fort . Unable to manage another step in a different direction other than forward , it let out of a rattled moan and collapsed into the river bed . Her brother did not celebrate the victory and stared at the fallen beast in shock . <newline> <newline> Maria could only stare , watching as the happy California cow expired right before her eyes . This was far different then the dancing bovines on the milk cartons that would dot the breakfast table each morning . All she could hear was that desperate moan of death and defeat that the creature gave out in its final moments . Her eyes looked over to the first cow , who continued on with little regard for its fallen comrade . The moan played out in her ears again , and she missed the ring of more bells . A frenzied ring , that often signified the annoyance and frustration of her aunt , but amplified a thousand times . An endless chorus of bronze upon bronze each in a constant cadence . Each chime falling right after the other , often with dozens overlapping .

2,"Jotted down in about an hour , more than 10 years ago . Have n't touched it since . <newline> <newline> Title : For The Life Of Me <newline> <newline> <newline> Chapter One <newline> <newline> <newline> Old houses are greedy . They hold tight to their component parts , embracing brick and mortar , plaster and timber , in a close-mouthed geometry of wariness . Merely reface their exteriors and they may forgive you ; rip up the integrity of the internal structure , and they are likely to scream . Nails shriek and boards moan under the onslaught of change . Measurements carefully taken beforehand never quite equal the intended re-allotment of space . <newline> <newline> Grace and Roger Covington live in such a house . <newline> <newline> ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Grace ! Where the hell are you ? '' Roger stands at the kitchen counter dressed only in his pajama pants , holding a steaming mug of coffee in one hand and grinding away the tiredness from his eyes with the other . His thick dark hair , an unruly shock of almost-black , stands in all directions . He yawns . <newline> <newline> Sunlight streams through the many-paned windows that run the length of the kitchen , warming an expanse of polished hardwood floor . Dust motes dance in the still golden air . Roger listens to the silence and tries to discern the location of his uncommunicative and distant wife . She was up and out of bed before he was . She always is these days . <newline> <newline> He pads toward the front of the house with a limp that is now almost imperceptible , quickening his pace along the stretch of dark hallway . His arms tighten against his sides , unconsciously shrinking from walls that seem too close , that loom ceilingward in a frozen predatory leer . By the time he 's gained the foyer , his heart rate has kicked up a notch . <newline> <newline> Daylight plays along the windows , never quite managing to penetrate the gloomy interior . All of their friends and acquaintances are enchanted with the place , envious even . They tell them it 's beautiful and becomes more so with every improvement Grace artfully bestows upon its convoluted interior . In response to such compliments , Roger vaguely smiles and nods and says nothing . <newline> <newline> At the bottom of the stairs , he stops for a moment to look back . It 's like looking through the wrong end of a telescope - the spot of bright sunshine in the kitchen he 's just left seems miles away . His eyes dart along the dim passage , ranging over mahogany woodwork and the heavy door that leads to the basement . He curls a lip at the dark paneling . Fuck you , hallway . <newline> <newline> Roger turns and hitches himself up the stairs , trying to ignore the way the patterned carpet runner seems reluctant to let go of his bare feet . He digs his toes into the risers , eying the coarse fabric and mentally yelling at it to stay put . It shifts under his weight . Grace has always told him he was imagining it . She tells him he imagines lots of things . <newline> <newline> Gaining the second floor , he leans through a doorway , careful not to rest his hand on the door frame . The finish has not yet dried . <newline> <newline> Paintbrushes stand upright in their assigned places and stacked canvases lean against the wall . The artist is absent . Roger scans the room Grace has used as a studio since they bought this overpriced Victorian pile of claustrophobia and frowns . <newline> <newline> `` Grace ? '' <newline> <newline> A noise overhead captures his attention . He looks up at the too low ceiling , completely at odds with the too high ceilings of the ground floor . Everything about this house is out of scale . He hates it . <newline> <newline> Something heavy drags across the floor above him . Grace 's whereabouts <newline> are no longer unknown . <newline> <newline> ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Grace stands and wipes her hands on her baggy sleeveless sweatshirt . Roger , almost at the top of the stairs that lead into the third floor attic space , pauses to take a look at her . <newline> <newline> Deep dark eyes in an elfin face ; short dark hair , at the moment more shaggy than spiky . A petite frame draped in a paint-spattered purple rag of a sweatshirt over faded blue jeans . White canvas deck shoes that are no longer white . <newline> <newline> She tilts her head at him . `` That for me ? '' She watches him hobble up the last of the stairs and he hands her the coffee . <newline> <newline> `` Sure is , babe . '' He tries for cheerful , manages neutral . `` You know I do n't drink this stuff . '' <newline> <newline> She smiles a timid smile at him and stretches up on tiptoe to kiss his cheek . For a moment , something like hope flits across his soul . It does n't last . <newline> <newline> He takes a look around . She 'll be busy today . She 's busy every day . Gallon paint cans and rolls of wallpaper , hammers and putty knives ; exacto blades , color swatches , and a riot of other interior makeover junk is scattered everywhere . The attic is on its third iteration . <newline> <newline> Over the past year , he 's gone from what are you doing ? to what the hell are you doing ? to what the fuck is this ? to frightened silence . She has to stop this . He does n't think she will . <newline> <newline> Roger breathes out a sigh and runs a hand through his disordered hair . `` Ok , I 'm going to hit the shower and then I 'm off to work . See you tonight . '' <newline> <newline> He trudges back down the stairs , an uneven frown against the pain in his leg . He listens for a thanks for the coffee or even a perfunctory have a good day . <newline> <newline> He hears neither . <newline> <newline> ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <newline> <newline> Grace leans a knee on the window seat in the attic and watches her husband back out of the driveway and turn up the street . Their car , a silver Lexus as pristine and unmarred as the day it arrived , an insurance settlement for the one that was totaled , disappears into a dip in the hilly terrain . <newline> <newline> She places a hand against the glass , suddenly overcome with the impulse to snatch him back . `` I love you . '' <newline> <newline> There is a quaver in her voice and it falls away unnaturally fast , the silence that permeates the house seeming to swallow it whole . She darts a guilty self-conscious look around the room but the implements laid out for her day 's work merely lay there with blank indifference and make no judgments . They simply wait . <newline> <newline> Shaking her head at her own foolishness , she wonders , not for the first time , if she 's going mad . <newline> <newline> <newline>

2,"Ever since Meta was a small child , growing up in the Ondeika river-basin , a dilapidated orphanage the only home she had ever known , she had yearned for adventure . Meta loved stories . She was the type of rare creature capable of falling into a book face-first with utter disregard for what the rest of the world might think of her . Stories of legendary heroes slaying fire-breathing dragons , brave adventurers questing for ancient treasure , and chivalrous knights rescuing damsels who seem to be perpetually in a state of distress had all fascinated her from an early age . To her , that was the way of the world . It was this deep cultivation of her insatiable hunger for excitement brought on by engrossing herself in fantastic stories which had led her to this particular moment , in which she found herself at the heart of a frozen cavern , staring into the icy-cold abyss of a fully-grown dragon ’ s eyes , which seemed to indicate it was a mite bit agitated at her presence at the very least . To say she was underprepared by her childhood for this moment would be doing the dragon a great disservice . <newline> <newline> *Hindsight ’ s twenty-twenty , * Meta thought to herself , sword in hand , shield at the ready . She looked around the cavern , seeking some fleeting tactical advantage as the dragon stared her down . When Meta and her cohorts had first arrived at the goblin den , they had each thought it would be a fairly straightforward “ sweep and clean ” operation . She had never imagined that the exorbitant sum they had been paid was indicative of any looming danger . It had never occurred to her that the “ god ” to which the goblins had claimed they were paying tribute was real . Their unpreparedness had cost them dearly . One of her companions had already tussled with the dragon and been bested , and the other was doing his best to bring the former round to consciousness . In the meantime , Meta had to square off against the hulking beast alone . <newline> <newline> The beauty and stillness of the room would have been rather spiritual , under different circumstances . The cavern was taller than it was wide ; its ceiling arching high above like a frozen cathedral . The torches that Meta and her cohorts had hastily dropped while drawing their weapons provided an ethereal glow which emanated from the center of the tomb , fading into blackness at its furthest expanses . The torchlight danced along the edges of the lowest-hanging icicles which criss-crossed the ceiling . The walls were frosted over in sheets of ice which appeared to have been accumulating for quite some time , a result of the natural dampness of the cavern compounded with the chilling presence of the dragon itself . The floor was likewise encased in ice , and Meta was finding it difficult to maintain her balance on such a treacherous surface . Three frozen pillars stretched from the floor to the ceiling , possibly load-bearing , and the space between the farthest one and the wall looked just narrow enough to disallow the dragon passage . <newline> <newline> Meta took a chilled , foggy breath and refocused her attention on the dragon . Even though it was diminutive in comparison to others of its kind , it was still easily the size of an adult behemoth . Frost dusted its off-white armor-like hide , a color which reminded Meta of sour milk , and crystals of ice clung to its thick , bat-like wings in patches . Atop its head it raised a high crest . Its head and body seemed to blend into one-another by an unremarkable neck , and body ridges ran along the length of its spine , diminishing as they reached the tail . Its legs were squat , but muscular , and each ended in a set of razor-sharp claws that seemed well-adapted to finding purchase in the terrain of its enclosure . Though this particular specimen seemed bloated from tribute , it was still nothing less than a killing machine . <newline> <newline> The dragon bellowed deeply , a sound which reminded Meta of the time the local farm had left its cows out in a thunderstorm . The beast stretched its wings in intimidation , and the crystals that had once clung to them like crust on an eyelid scattered across the cavern , shattering as they hit the floor . Some of the shards hailed down on Meta , and the sound of the ice clanging upon her armor resonated throughout the chasm . The creature seemed to have recently awoken from a deep slumber , as it still had parcels of treasure frozen to its underbelly . Dragons were slow to wake , and exploiting this one ’ s grogginess might be Meta ’ s best chance for survival . <newline> <newline> Meta watched the dragon ’ s movements carefully , keeping her gaze level with its pale blue eyes . She was waiting for it to make the first strike . It lowered its head and eyed her up as well . Dragons were patient creatures , and Meta felt herself being studied , as a gazelle might feel when being watched by a lion . It was a humbling sensation . The dragon was going to strike , and Meta had to be ready to respond . Its tail curved from side to side , like that of a cat preparing its balance for a pounce . Suddenly , its tail shot straight out , and the dragon charged full-force at the armored warrior . <newline> <newline> Up until that moment , the way the dragon moved had drawn more parallels with the grace of a feline than with any other creature , but the way it barreled forward was more akin to that of a charging rhinoceros than any great cat . It closed the distance between the two of them rapidly , bearing its teeth , great puffs of frost billowing from its nostrils and mouth . If Meta had been nothing more than an ordinary warrior , she might have had little recourse to the dragon ’ s sudden attack . As luck would have it , she came prepared . Not specifically for eight tons of pure , unadulterated murder moving towards her at 40 miles per hour , but all-purpose preparation nonetheless . <newline> <newline> She quickly relinquished hold of her shield , allowing it to loosely dangle from her arm by its strap . With her newly-freed hand , she grabbed the icon of her chosen deity , the goddess of luck and change , which hung from her neck by a simple cord of rope . “ Kneel dragon ! ” she shouted as she raised the symbol to the dragon in a defiant stance . The icon emitted a white flare of light at the oncoming juggernaut . The dragon , conditioned to an absence of light due to a lengthy retirement from the surface world ’ s shine , was blinded instantly . It let out a guttural scream of pain and frustration , turning its head to avert its gaze . Its legs clawed desperately at the ice below in an attempt to slow its acceleration , but it couldn ’ t grip the slick surface at such an intense speed . <newline> <newline> <newline>

2,"<newline> Nothing stirred in the woods , not even a breeze to stir the leaves of the trees . Gradually receding into open lawn and gardens filled with flowers and shrubbery , perfectly manicured and giving the forest the appearance of being wild and untamed , despite being as meticulously controlled as the gardens that sat not two hundred feet away . Surrounding the acres of trees and fields sat a wrought iron deer fence , unbroken except for the ornate entry gate that sat at the top of the white gravel driveway . absence of trees and shrubs had revealed a high black iron fence in the distance . The landscape was dimly lit by the quarter moon overhead and the few lights that shone down from the nearby mansion . With a simple red brick exterior , the mansion loomed out of the darkness , casting much of its fields in shadow . A small number of windows let out the telltale glow of lamps , mostly coming from the basement windows which peeked out above the white gravel pathway that circled the mansion . <newline> <newline> The peace of the night was damaged by the woman sprinting down the lawn . As fast as she was moving she still moved quietly and with ease . Her hands were cradled around her pregnant belly , as if by holding it she hoped to limit any jolting to the stomach . Once she reached the trees she moved with far more ease , slipping through them as if she had lived there all her life and knew every tree personally . Her breath came out in sharp pants as she continued to move , barefoot and dressed only in a large t-shirt and maternity shorts . Occasionally she turned to look behind her , searching for anyone pursuing her but her focus always returned to the area she was running through . Her golden eyes seemed to see every obstacle in her way and she either avoided them or corrected herself quickly when she stumbled over them . <newline> <newline> Faint shouts came from behind her as lights flicked on in the hallway and some other first floor rooms . Men spilled out on to the lawn , running to the nearby stables . Horses were saddled quickly and forced into a hard canter . Once they reached the lawn they sped up to a gallop . The sound of horses hooves drawing nearer caused the woman to speed up , the very edge of the forest coming into view and just beyond it the artificial river that ran the edges of the property and beyond that , the fence . Her feet splashed through the water , the ankle deep water deepening until it reached her knees . She continued to wade through the water , desperate to reach the fence on the other side . The horses had been slowed by the trees but were fast gaining on her , their riders shouting directions to each other as they shone torches ahead of them . <newline> <newline> Throwing herself at the fence , she grabbed hold of the bars and began to pull herself up . Her swollen belly hindered her progress yet she still climbed with a grim determination . As her hands grazed the spikes of the trellis , the first horse broke the tree line . Its rider urged the horse forward into until it had reached the climbing woman . As she clung to the bars and desperately tried to shimmy higher , his hand darted forward and sank into her hair . Turning the horse out of the river , he dragged her off the bars while she screamed and thrashed against the firm grip , the water showering back down on her as she kicked it into the air . Once he had both horse and woman on dry land he dismounted and pulled her up to face him . <newline> <newline> “ What have I said about trying to run away Meeya ? ” he demanded , waiting for a response to a question that should have become rhetorical from the amount of times it had been repeated . By now she had stopped struggling and was glaring up at him , a foot shorter than him . Her clothes had been soaked through from the river yet she did not seem to feel the cold of the water on her skin . Her hands had returned to cradling her belly . He shook her by the hair as he spoke again , her head jerking in his hands . “ Did you really think you ’ d get away with stealing what is mine ? ” She let out an animalistic sound , almost a growl , as she heard the question . <newline> <newline> “ She ’ s mine ! Not your- ” was all Meeya managed to spit out before the hand not maintaining a grip in her hair backhanded her across the face , splitting her lip and causing her to cry out . Her legs buckled and she would have collapsed if her captor did not hold tight to her . He pulled her back to a standing position and he grabbed her by the chin , forcing her to look him in the eye . <newline> <newline> “ That child is mine and you are not going anywhere . The sooner you realise that , the better ” , his hand moved from her chin to her belly where he pushed her fingers away so that he could lay his palm just under her belly button . <newline> <newline> “ Mine ” he hissed before taking her by the arm and pushing her over to a small clearing where the men who awaited their commands on horseback . She was led to the only man who showed concern for her and who also held the reins to the only spare horse . As her detainer lifted her onto the horse and tied her hands to the saddle , she glanced to the guard who held the reins . He shook his head a little at her before looking away , keeping whatever opinions he had to himself . <newline> <newline> “ Stran ” , Meeya ’ s captor and the guard ’ s commander called out to him . <newline> <newline> “ Yes , sir ? ” he replied as his eyes snapped to his commander . <newline> <newline> “ Take Meeya back to her room and see that she stays there . The rest of you settle your horses and return to your duties. ” The command was firm and the man who had given it was already turning back to his horse when a chorus of yes sir ’ s rang out through the clearing . As the others all turned and cantered away Stran took the reins of both horses and started off at a trot for home . Once they were safely deep in the forest he slowed slightly and turned to look at her . <newline> <newline> “ Really Meeya , again ? ” his question did not need a response and she did not give one as she attempted to pick at the ropes circling her wrists and stared sullenly up at the mansion they were approaching , determined that this failure would not stop her from trying to escape again . <newline>

2,"> Well It 's 18 hours later , because only now would this show up on my front page , guess that teaches me to not look all over Reddit all day . <newline> <newline> > According to the backup file this was last edited in 2010 , not much more has progressed since then , for the late comers maybe it will be read by someone ... .. <newline> <newline> Extracted from Lost Horizons , Terrance Shannon , 2335 , Firestone Books <newline> <newline> `` That 's a name I have n't heard in a long time '' . <newline> <newline> `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well folk around these parts do n't mention the Horizon War if they can avoid it . '' <newline> <newline> `` It will be twelve years come April '' . <newline> <newline> `` You do n't say '' . <newline> <newline> It ’ s a dark dreary morning in the lower quarters of what was once the city of Baltimore . Now part of the super city sprawls across the east cost of the Union of North American States . Off a small side alley that dates back to the early twentieth century is a small bar , with its Georgian facades and hanging sign . It 's reminiscent of the antiques found in the British Isles of the European Union . Above the door swinging in the light breeze is a wooden sign proclaiming the name of the establishment as `` The Skull and Cutlass '' . Inside the warm , albeit dark confines of the bar the man I 'm speaking to , the owner , turns and slowly places the glass in his hand upon a shelf along the wall , on his face is the half smirk , quarter grin that most of his former comrades remembered and described him by . His eyes those of a man in constant thought , who sees everything and nothing . He is , or was , Capitan Jerry Cole a former fighter pilot for the Interstellar Independent Forces ; The ISIF , he is also the strongest lead to the story I have been hunting for over three years . His face lightenes at the notion of time `` Well , it has been so long , one wonders where all the years went , never did get an invite to the reunion ” . His smile broadens at his own bon mot “ I should ask you though , seeing as you are n't here to wish me happy anniversary what can I do for you ? '' he leans over the bar to where I 'm sitting . I do n't reply immediately , reaching into my bag and removing the data pad and placing it down on the aged timbers . “ I wanted to show you this , because I thought you might be able to help with a project I ’ m undertaking ” . <newline> <newline> The thin screen flickers to life and immediately it begins to scroll through a series of images . We both watch . I know each one , pictures taken so many years ago . <newline> <newline> `` Well that 's some slide show where did you get them ? '' he asks . <newline> `` I took them . I was there at Horizon , on the ground that is , in the refugee camps and in New Moscow , saw it all , and took every image I could when the Pozitians were n't looking . But I can still remember looking up to the sky at the contrails and hearing every bit of second hand info we could get . That 's why I 'm here , I 'm following him '' with this I scroll the image line on the data pad until the last picture is displayed . It ’ s blurry taken from a low oblique angle . In the hazy green sky are two dark metallic shapes , fighters . The unmistakeable shape of fighters , both are banking towards the camera . On the tail of one is an image in bright yellow and red : that of the mythical Phoenix . “ Well that takes me back ” he looks up “ of course before I can provide any answers that may assist you perhaps you can enlighten me to what it is you seek ? ” <newline> <newline> “ What I seek is the story behind the pictures , I was researching my book ” . From my bag I hand him a roughly joined together manuscript . “ When I received a data pack from the ISIF headquarters in the old UN building , in it was this ” I hand forward two documents one is an after action report dated May 13 2315 , the other is a print out from a data disc ; the official listing of all ISIF task-forces , capital ships and squadrons . Dog eared and coffee stained , it was forced open on a page with a section highlighted in blue marker . His face lightens with recognition “ The report filed by you lists you and your flight lead as members of the 108th Tactical . You were n't though ; ISIF lists you as an active member of the 127th Superiority Squadron . There are no names listed on the report ether . So I did a little digging in my old notes ” he raises his hand to stop my monologue , but I continue anyway “ And I remembered hearing about a squadron the ‘ Phoenix ’ team , you were one of its pilots were n't you ? ” <newline> I look up and find him staring into my eyes , his have gone completely cold “ It ’ s a hell of a story if you really want to know , but mine ’ s only a small part in honesty ... ... ” he pauses , I move to speak but with a wave of his hand motions me into silence . After a minute or so his lips curl and he speaks again “ And I guess the official secrets act wo n't hold me any more now that I 'm out so , if you have the time where do you want me to begin ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Well you could start when 2nd Task force was deployed , or on the 13th , the day you two met , it is your choice really ” my voice , despite my best efforts rises with excitement at finally finding the lead , at the confirmation , I had been after for so long “ perhaps you could start by answering this question : what was it like the day you met him ? ” <newline> At this point his eye no longer that of thought , the joviality is lost from his voice as memories flood to the forefront of his conscience . The smirk gone from his face , in its place is a blank facade neutrality and control like that of a professional warrior the thousand yard stare locking the hazel eyes into eternity . Finally he begins and the curtain rises . <newline> <newline> “ It was a day like every other in space ... Black , save the light by the stars ... . ”

2,"*knuckle crack* <newline> <newline> -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> Footsteps and cartwheels , hawkers and hagglers , children and old men and young mothers alike . The sounds of living spread , soaking the city from end to end . The Pink Markets were the lungs of the city , and as it breathed , even the buildings seemed alive . Foods and furnishings , crockery and cookware all traded hands in exchange for thick copper coins with the face of the Doge stamped on each , or slim silver squares , marked with a tower . <newline> <newline> Deftly waltzing amoungst the bronzed locals and deeply tanned sailors , a tall figure bore through the crowds unabated by the crush of bodies . Reaching his arms over the pressing masses in front of a stall , he lifted a pair of meat and vegetable skewers from the grill and flicked a stack of coins into the owners hands , stopping his indignant outburst in its tracks . Still walking , he headed through the crowds to the public fountain . Bites of steaming lamb vanished into his smiling mouth , along with a crunchy purple tuber and thick slices of zucchini . <newline> <newline> Looking around as he went , his gaze wandered across the terraced streets , the smoking chimneys of the cities kilns , and the wide docks that spread over half the city . A cart full of pottery lay still by the road , a wheel wedged in a gap between the pavers . A light touch as he passed , and the cart lurched forward and began rolling , with sighs of relief from the man leading the ox . <newline> <newline> Breaking into the area around the fountain , a commotion greeted him . A well dressed North Island sailor squared off against a slim local , with a sneer as broad as the sailors accent . <newline> <newline> `` Look here you sly little bastard , '' said the sailor , `` If you reckon you can take*my* ship , from *me* , cause of a bet some idiot crew made , you 'd best think again '' <newline> <newline> `` Ah but mister captain , your crew , even your first mate has agreed that i am now in command of your vessel . '' Smug satisfaction dripped from the sneerers voice . <newline> <newline> `` That 's just cause you 'ave em over a barrel with the money they owe and the drink they drunk ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Perhaps , but it is their consensus nonetheless , no ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No is about right mate , d'you want to have a go at me do you ? '' bellowed the sailor , gritting his teeth and tugging his cuffs . The local simply smiled , looked at the dock , and bolted towards a rotund cargo ship . The sailor roared in outrage , and set off after him , bumping and stumbling through the crowds <newline> <newline> The man broke his smile to show a quick grimace , tossed the wooden skewers from his lunch aside , and broke into a stride after them . Blowing through the crowd , he marched after the sneering locals head , bobbing through the crowds . Parting the sea of people , the man reached the ship as the sneerer took his place aboard , met by a dozen Grand Isle sailors and a trio of large local men with larger local truncheons . The ships oars began to dip and raise , and is began to move out of port as the furious shrieking of the captain cut through the crowd . Walking alongside the leaving ship , the tall man strode to the end of the pier , did a sharp about turn , and grabbed the edge of the ships deck . The shrieking wail of old , salted wood added to the cacophony , accompanied by the slosh of seawater . The stolen ship stopped , and hauled into reverse . Swearing in three different languages erupted from the ship as it was hauled towards the waters edge . As the ship neared , the sneerer scrambled out of its small cabin with a knife in hand and a face as white as a sheet . Scrambling over to the edge of the deck , the ship-thief swallowed , grimaced , and cut the tall man 's throat with a swift slice . The ship kept moving , and the tall man kept walking , the cut in his neck sealing with only a slim white line to show it was ever there . The new line lay across half a dozen other similar marks . Pulling the ship up to the edge of the dock , the tall man reached up and gripped the stunned thief by the collar , holding him inches from his face , and smiling . <newline> <newline> `` I do *not* think you , little man , should have done what you did . '' <newline> <newline> A trickle of yellow warmth dripped onto the pavers , trailing as the terrified man was dragged along , feet far above the ground . <newline> <newline> `` Maybe you should stick to sailing ships that you own , or betting on the next round of drinks instead '' A snort escaped the tall man 's nose . `` Because I do n't like when possessions are stolen , from their honest owners . And I have the time , so , so much time to deal with it when I see it . Because , you see , I 've been around for a good while , and i 'll be around for a good while more . Because I am the Man of Good Cheer , and there 's nothing that *anybody* can do to stop me . Believe me , people have tried . '' <newline> <newline> Sliding the cuff on his free hand down , he exposed his forearm to reveal a criss-crossing network of tiny , thin white lines . <newline> <newline> `` And now . '' he said , as he hefted the limp body of the man above his head , `` I must bid you goodbye . '' Breaking out into the fountain 's plaza , he hefted the thief into the deepest part of the fountain , smiling broadly as the man hit the water with a mighty `` splosh '' . <newline> <newline> Weaving through the crowds again , ruffling the hair of awestruck children and brushing aside the approaches of the others , the Man of Good Cheer picked up a bag of roast hazelnuts , tossed the price and change to the vendor , and left the city , walking along the long , long road to the ancient , great city of Babylon . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- <newline> <newline> <newline> Did n't go over this , or revise or really anything so I 'll be honest , the wording and heck , even the premise here is probably shit .

2,"This will probably get buried but here 's part of the prologue . Hope folks find it enjoyable , if not inspirational ! <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> He felt the snow crunch beneath his feet , the chilled wind biting at his bare arms and legs as he pressed onward . Any normal person would have fainted by now , a forgotten memory buried beneath the storm with only a shoe or a glove sticking out as a stark warning to anyone that dared trespass this territory . Any normal person would have given up when they 'd seen the massive metal gate that marked the entrance to this icy outdoors , guarded by some of the fiercest military that no sane nation possessed , let alone a private organization such as theirs . Any normal person would not have felt the heat of something intangible , powerful , a force yet unleashed that continued driving them onwards in search of someone that they 'd only witnessed in a dream with a cliched hand stretched towards them as though enticing them to approach , or perhaps reaching for an escape of their own . <newline> <newline> Raevin , however much he wished it to be true , was not normal . <newline> <newline> Even as the thoughts whirled in the back of his mind while the wind whipped at his waist , barely covered by the remains of a bullet-ridden t-shirt as his legs were by a pair of shredded blue shorts , it was the name that stuck with him . It felt strange and not quite comfortable , as though it had belonged to someone else . The rest of his memories were just as scattered , his mind a reflection of the empty snowdrifts and white landscape that enveloped him . The sharp sting of the cold air made it even more difficult to concentrate . Raevin felt his short , black hair stiffening into spikes tinged with icicles that clung stubbornly with each passing step , his muscles sore and aching from physical exertion he did n't remember save this maddening walk through a frozen hell . <newline> <newline> As he made his way over the hill , a pair of headlights nearly blinded him . Instead of flinching or shying away , however , he growled in annoyance , a sound deep and gutteral that but for the storm would have echoed around him . The sound of a small engine cut through the wind and he turned his head slightly to gauge the distance between the vehicle and him . Even with his enhanced vision it still took him a minute to discern the outline of a snowmobile that was heading right for him . Part of his mind was screaming to run away , and he might very well have had it not been for the very soft , female voice that suddenly reverberated in his mind . <newline> <newline> *Peace . * <newline> <newline> He felt his entire body shudder in shock at the word , let alone the fact that it seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time . Had it been the first time he 'd heard it , he might very well have unleashed his hidden fury at the newcomer as they brought their snowmobile alongside him . They were bundled from head to toe in dark gray layers of clothing he 'd never seeen before that hid their features , including a mask over their face . Raevin pondered his options even as he was already taking a step towards them . <newline> <newline> *We must go now . * <newline> <newline> The voice was soft , but firm in the command . Raevin felt more than just a little irritation at it as he climbed on the back of the snowmobile , his thick muscled arms automatically wrapping around the waist of the driver . No matter who this person was , no matter where he 'd come from , Raevin knew this was his only chance to get away from whatever it was that had been pursuing him , and nothing was going to stop him from taking it now . A quick glance over his shoulder confirmed his worry as several pairs of lights suddenly popped over the hill he 'd just climbed with similar roaring engines . He felt his blood begin to boil at the thought of having to deal with those people again , but just as he had steeled himself for the jump that would 've led him back into the fray , three things happened at almost the same time . <newline> <newline> The first was the sudden hail of bullets that ricocheted off the snowmobile to send sparks flying everywhere . Raevin marvelled that not only did they not hit him nor the driver , but the snowmobile itself seemed completely unharmed . Either of these might have happened by pure luck in and of themselves , but together he began to suspect something else was at work , something far more interesting that resonated within his body in a rush of excitement and adrenaline mixing in ways that made him feel more alive than ever before . <newline> <newline> The second was when the hood of the driver flew back to reveal the most beautiful red-headed woman Raevin had ever seen in his entire life . For the briefest of moments he caught a glimpse of her emerald green eyes as she glared into the darkness behind them . He was n't sure if it was a trick of the wind or his eyes , but her lips parted to let loose a string of what he could only guess was some forgotten language before she turned her head forward again . He wondered if she was simply cursing that they 'd been caught already , or if she 'd been shouting a warning that he could n't hear through the roaring engines and storm thundering around them , but he had his answer much faster than he would 've liked . <newline> <newline> Because the third thing that happened was his answer - a massive fireball almost as large as him suddenly coalesced into existence for no reason whatsoever , hovering inches from the left side of his face . Raevin barely had time to duck as it flew upwards before splitting into several smaller orange-red spheres that abruptly engulfed every single one of their attacker 's vehicles , erupting in explosions that shook him hard enough that he clamped harder to her waist . The sound continued to echo around them as she turned sharply to the right just in time to slip between a pair trees . With one hand she pulled the hood back over her head and effectively put an end to any thoughts of conversation that he might have had , but he was okay with that . <newline> <newline> *Yes* , Raevin thought to himself with a smile , *this is definitely more interesting than anything I could have hoped for . * <newline> <newline>

2,"The idea for this one is n't my own . My brother-in-law came up with the story , but gave up trying to write it and I really like the idea so I took it up . <newline> ___________________________________________________________________ <newline> The blue-haired woman fled across the desert . She was pursued ruthlessly by Nash Eason . Day and night he followed her , yet he was always one step behind . He knew where she was headed and on the eighth day , he saw it , looming on the horizon : the City of Sanctuary . It was there that the blue-haired woman could seek refuge from her crime . If Nash could catch her before she reached the walls of the city , he could take his revenge . If she made it inside—no . He wouldn ’ t think about that . Not now . Not when he was so close . <newline> <newline> Night had fallen . It was his eighth with no sleep . But he couldn ’ t stop . He couldn ’ t lose the blue-haired woman . His horse fell on the fifth day and still he forged on . He grew increasingly weary , living on water and gruel , but he could not , no , would not stop . He could already see it . He was prepared for what he had to do . He would overtake the woman , grab her by the throat and watch as the life left her body . He would take her life , just as she had taken his . <newline> <newline> Less than two weeks before , Nash Eason ’ s life had been perfect . He had been a simple man . A man of peace . He lived in a small settlement two days outside a larger town . Nash and his wife , June Eason , made a living off the land farming , and trading their crops in the town to the west . After seven year of marriage , Nash and June ’ s prayers had been answered . They were expecting a child . He could not have been happier ; life was perfect for him . <newline> <newline> On his way home from a week of trading , Nash whistled a short tune . It was a song that his mother had sung to him when he was a child that he planned to sing to his children . It was a tune that would come to haunt him forever . As the last few notes passed his lips , Nash noticed a dark haze in the distance and the smell of smoke burned his nostrils . In a panic , he spurred his horse on , pushing it to the boundaries of its speed . Before he reached the settlement he could see the blaze . Every home , every barn , every crop was burning . He leaped from his horse and ran down the small streets to his home . It was an unrecognizable pile of ash and smoldering wood . As he stumbled toward the remains , he saw his wife laying on her back before the burning house . He fell to his knees in front of his wife and took her in his arms . Tears began to fall from his face when he saw the blood flowing freely from a thick gash across her neck . He hugged her lifeless body to him as sobs wracked his being . Nash looked up and in the distance he saw the woman . Her silver-blue hair glinted in the sunlight . She locked eyes with him before her and the men with her rode into the distance . Nash lay one last kiss on his wife ’ s lips before he began to dig her grave . At sunset , he would ride out after the blue-haired woman . <newline> <newline> As the moon rose over the dessert on the eighth night , Nash walked . He no longer had the strength to run or even jog . It was only out of sheer will that he was able to continue on at all . He wet his cracked lips from his water skin . He carefully weighed it in his hand , judging how much water remained . If he rationed his water carefully Nash figured that he could make it for another two days . He pleaded to a God he once believed in that he close to Sanctuary , and that it was not too late . As the night wore on , the wind picked up . The sand bit and stung at his eyes and face . He wrapped a kerchief around his face to shield him , but it hardly helped . The sand filled his boots and the wind nearly halted his progress . He nearly gave up hope when he saw the first tent . He had reached the Vengeance Camp . It was here that wronged people hoped to carry out the only law of the land : an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . <newline> <newline> The Vengeance Camp meant that Sanctuary was only a few miles off . Sanctuary was one of only three cities on the massive island of Golgotha where criminals could find refuge from their crime . If a criminal could make it into Sanctuary , they were untouchable by the people they had wronged . Outside the city , common people camped for miles around with the hope that a criminal would show their face outside the city . They were waiting and hoping to take their revenge . Given new energy by the presence of the tents , Nash Eason began to run again . <newline> <newline> He ran until the sun began to peak its head about the squat towers of the city . The sun rose slowly bleeding red light across the landscape . Nash ’ s blood boiled in hatred and anger as he saw the blue-haired woman and her band standing outside the gate of the city . They were waiting for him . As Nash sprinted towards them , they lowered their rifles . They fired . Nash dropped to the ground . A round had gone clean through his left arm . He gritted his teeth against the pain and got up to run again . The woman and her followers had dismounted and were stepping through the gate . She spread her arms and bowed as the gates to the city closed . Nash fell to his knees before the gates and clutched his arm . He cried out in agony and anguish . He lay his head against the stone doors of Sanctuary . He had a choice in front of him : should he beak the law and pursue the woman into the city to exact his revenge , or should he follow the law and leave her be . At that moment , Nash ’ s world went dark and as he passed from consciousness .

2,"Shimmering fingers of sunlight slowly crept their way up the tattered and decrepit remains of what used to be a wall ; all that was left to shield the eastern facing portion of a no-longer-habitable apartment building . Despite its lack of charm or reasonable shelter , it was a blessing to those squatting it . After The Event , anything to keep nature at bay was revered as kingly . Without delay , daybreak began to seep into the cracks and nooks of the concrete structure . The inhabitants began to rise from their makeshift beds and homes to the soft turquoise hue of the sunlight flooding over the remains of the courtyard . What one would likely think was the brightest of these rays of light curled its finger over the bullet-hole laden wall and directly in to the eye of a gruff man mostly tucked beneath a makeshift leather blanket . His jet black tousled hair covered his forehead and slunk back beneath the stack of crumpled curtains that had been made in to a pillow . A thick beard , peppered with white and black hung from his face , nearly hiding his half-opened mouth . <newline> <newline> Without warning or reason , the wall closest to the man erupted into a cloud of debris and dust , sending him toppling over several feet into the adjacent corner of the open room . His head cracking against the concrete was audible even to those several rooms over . A grimace of pain swept over the man 's face for only a moment , and quickly turned into trained determination as he bolted forward towards the bed of sorts that he head created for himself . His hand swung beneath the leather cover , affording him the split second necessary to grab hold of the long metallic pole he had been sleeping next to . With only a hair 's breadth to spare , he deflected the next of the supersonic projectiles that had destroyed the wall . The projectile tore through the concrete as though it was n't even there , creating smoldering crater in its wake . <newline> <newline> `` Whew . For someone who has n't had Stim in a while , you move pretty good . '' A jeering snicker followed the statement . <newline> <newline> At the top of the mangled three story apartment complex crouched a young man in nondescript black clothing , his gaze hidden behind a thick black visor . His toothy grin seemed to stretch from ear to ear , almost touching the corners of his dark brown hair that drooped over his head like a misplaced mop . His gaunt and slender frame wiggled uncomfortably , anxious . Impossibly sharp , claw-like metallic fingers clicked against the concrete , chipping it away bit by bit . His teeth ground back and forth as he shifted uneasily but showed almost no signs of wear . He leaned forward ever so slightly , peering down at the civilian man beneath him brandishing the long metal pole . <newline> <newline> `` Tch . You look helpless . Are you really THAT Aign ? '' The sickly thin man tilted his head.. and continued tilting it , until it had rotated almost completely upend . <newline> <newline> The man on the ground seemed undaunted as he swung himself up to his feet upon hearing the voice above , peering through brilliant golden eyes at his attacker . Now visible , he was clad in a simple white t-shirt and blue jeans . From the look of his feet , he had n't worn shoes in quite some time . His hands tightened around the pole for a brief moment before his posture relaxed and he stood upright . Only one hand now gripped the pole like a sword , which was hanging loosely at his side . With a sigh of frustration , he began to wander back to what remained of his resting place to piece together the items that had been strewn across the ground . The annoyance of his pursuer was palpable . The grinding of the attacker 's teeth became audible from the ground . The incessant click of his synthetic nails against the concrete was replaced with the groaning of the material beneath his clenched fists as it struggled to maintain its structural integrity . <newline> <newline> `` Don't.. you ... IGNORE ME ! AIGN ! ! '' The man clad in black rocketed from his perch towards the ground at inhuman speed , splaying his claws outwards as if to slice his target into ribbons . <newline> <newline> The scruffy man only stared with the same look of annoyed disinterest as his attacker approached faster than any human being could possibly react to . In that moment , he simply disappeared . The black clad man swung his hands down at where his target had been , finding no purchase in skin or bone . His body rolled across the ground a safe distance from his initial target , and without a moment of hesitation he was on his feet , intently looking from side to side to ascertain where his intended victim had gone . It was n't long before he received his answer . The rough , capped end of the metal pole pointed only inches from his face , still loosely gripped in its owners hand . Had it only been the single weapon , perhaps the attacker might not have been dissuaded , however that was n't what made him hesitate . The earth itself began to tremble , and the air seemed heavy , as if it was turning in to water . The attacker began to take long , labored breaths , standing perfectly still as he stared intently at the tip of the pole . Slowly he began to slump down to the floor as the shaking of the earth grew more violent . It was as if someone was squeezing the very life from him and pressing him to the ground . Sweat poured from his face . It was all he could do to pull his head up to look at the man above him . Into those glowing golden eyes . The world around him was starting to go black from the invisible pressure pushing him on to his hands and knees , forcing the breath from his lungs and choking him . <newline> <newline> As quickly as it began , it ended . The pursuer coughed and gasped from air as he rolled on to his back , causing his visor to clank on to the ground . Bloodshot blue eyes stared with a new found fear and desperation at the man he had been trying to kill . <newline> <newline> `` If you understand.. Leave . '' The man holding the pole spoke in his low , rumbling voice . <newline> <newline> The casually dressed man turned away from his attacker and stepped through the remains of the building 's doorway , continuing his pursuit of redemption .

2,"1 <newline> <newline> Near top of the domed rock stood a small , ancient tree . It was wizened and faded , but a few leaves protruded defiantly from the branches it had left , fluttering in the evening ’ s warm wind . Despite its appearance the tree ¬was unique . It was the only tree for over a hundred miles , and the only tree that Cassie had ever seen . <newline> <newline> As her hand wandered slowly across its bark Cassie thought to herself about how strange it was ; still , peaceful , but as alive as her . The tree had stood here since before she ’ d been born and might carry on long after she ’ d gone . It was a comforting thought . But what did other trees look like ? Did the old tree mind being so alone ? As the sun touched the horizon Cassie realised she ’ d have to hurry back , or be late for tea again . As she turned to head down the path she smiled ; <newline> <newline> ‘ Seeing as I ’ d only be waiting for you to join me , I thought I ’ d save some time and join you ” said her father as he trudged up <newline> <newline> ‘ Hey Dad , thanks . I was really just about to head down – <newline> <newline> ‘ Ah but I was just about to make it up ! Come on before it gets any colder ’ he said with a smile as he opened his bag . <newline> <newline> ‘ Cold mushroom stew and a two spoons . Thanks Dad ” said Cassie <newline> <newline> ‘ The stew is actually almost lukewarm ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ Almost being the key word there ’ <newline> <newline> Grumbling aside the stew was actually pretty good , thought Cassie as she tucked in . And to eat with a view - that definitely made up . <newline> <newline> Below and to the left of where Cassie sat curved the top of the domed rock , its strange blue sheen glimmering in the last of the light . To her sides the mountain it rested on plunged downwards , vanishing in the misty orange haze of the veil . In front of her a few stray clouds had torn themselves free , eddying gracefully through the sky . <newline> <newline> ‘ You know , I think this is longest we ’ ve ever sat here and without you asking me some kind of question . No how ’ s or where ’ s or even why ’ s . And I know how much you love the why ’ s ’ said Cassie ’ s father in gently chiding tones . <newline> <newline> ‘ It ’ s just ... I feel like I know everything around here – <newline> <newline> ‘ Everything ? That ’ s very impressive for a 19 year old girl ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ Well not everything , but there ’ s nothing new here . We live inside a tiny rock on the top of a small mountain with nothing but cloud around us for over a thousand miles. ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ But it ’ s such a pretty rock ! ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ Dad ! I want to see more ; the settled islands , the rusted wing above Haven . I want to touch the edge of the cloudstream , walk through a city and see nothing but new faces ! ’ <newline> <newline> Cassie stopped abruptly . She hadn ’ t meant to go on like that but it was all true . <newline> <newline> She ’ d give anything to see more of the world that she ’ d read so much about . She waited to be told by Dad that it was too dangerous , or about how he and mother had been so lucky to find the domed rock , or how – <newline> <newline> ‘ Alright . You ’ re a big girl now and I don ’ t want to keep you cooped up against your will . Next week when a tug sets off to the settled islands like normal we ’ ll go there . I ’ ll have reason to go to the cities anyway , so it makes sense. ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ Dad ! Thank you ! ” Cassie exclaimed as she hugged him tightly , almost knocking the bowl from his grasp . <newline> <newline> ‘ Easy girl , easy ! ” said Cassie ’ s father laughing “ you know you ’ ll have to earn your keep. ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ I will . I promise . I can ’ t wait ’ said Cassie . <newline> <newline> ‘ That ’ s settled then ’ said her father as he stood up . ‘ You ’ d better head on down to the rock . I ’ ve got to take a few measurements from up high tonight but I ’ ll be back in time for breakfast ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ Don ’ t miss it . I ’ ve got to reward you for this ! ’ said Cassie and with another hug set off down the slope . Excited thoughts bounced in her mind : what would the journey be like , how many new people would she meet ? <newline> <newline> Lost in thought Cassie made her way down the slope . In front of her unseeing eyes she drew level with the rock . The rock was a vast sphere of blueish stone , with an almost metallic sheen to it . The stone was incomparably tough and could only be shaped with great work , however it seemed that someone , at some point had found the time to work at it . The rock Cassie knew was a small but tidy collection of houses with a few shops – a village in a blue marble . <newline> <newline> Passing through the outer arch she nodded briefly at Grayson , the white bearded gentleman who was the rock ’ s sole guardian once night had fallen . Other settlements might have trouble , anything from drunken travellers to fearsome drifters but the rock managed fine with only Grayson . The rock attracted precisely the opposite of those sorts . <newline> <newline> Later , clothes changed and teeth brushed Cassie stared at the small picture of Mum on the edge of her mirror . She remembered when Dad had placed it on her 14th birthday ‘ A Dad ’ s guide to makeup - place picture of example by subject . Pause . Exit immediately ’ . Since then it had been a guide for Cassie in more than just make up ; it was a chance to talk and reflect and hope just a little bit that Mum would hear . <newline> <newline> ‘ Hey Mum ’ said Cassie softly ‘ I got some lovely news from Dad today . I ’ m sure you already know ; I can ’ t believe I ’ m really going to go . If you get a chance , send me dreams of your travels. ’ Cassie knew that if Mum were here then she ’ d love the plan . According to Dad it had been taken quite the scare for them to settle here at the edge of nowhere , and Mum had hinted she wanted them to move back once Cassie was born . <newline> <newline> Though , thought Cassie as her gaze shifted , without make up she didn ’ t look so much like Mum . When this picture was taken Mum had been happy , smiling , but you could see hunger ’ s pinch at the edge of her face . Mum ’ s hair had been dark , her features sharp and her eyes fierce . Cassie was more like Dad ; a soft face , with dirty blonde hair sweeping messily over friendly eyes . Still , as Cassie turned her head she smiled . She ’ d at least inherited Mum ’ s high cheekbones . <newline>

2,"I had already written the beginning as part of Nanowrimo . Usually ai n't much for writing , but it 's called Savage Swans . <newline> ___________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> You wan na be heroes ? Hmf . Everyone likes a superhero right ? The good guys , the bad guys , the adoring fans . The powers , the secret identity , the excitement . Fighting ... for justice . Take it from me you just can ’ t get enough of it . Putting on a mask like they do in the comic books and cleaning up your streets one good punch at a time . Despite what the more ludicrous theories suggest I ’ m not an alien from Mars , a mutant , a cyborg , or a demigod . What a ridiculous idea . I was just a guy in a mask . They called me the Minotaur . A real life caped crusader . I like to think I ’ m done with that life . <newline> <newline> In the beginning I loved the feeling of bloodied fist after a night on the town . To me it was a sign that I ’ d made a difference to my community . And I was damned good at it too . Drug dealers , rapists , thieves , murders . I ’ d crack a few skulls , wrap em up , and call the police . I made sure there was enough evidence to get them convicted . Scum every last one of them , I was sure of it . <newline> <newline> Unsurprisingly when my exploits started making the local news there were those who approved and those who didn ’ t . To my dreamer head I knew the naysayers would come around eventually . Just like the comics . <newline> <newline> As my notoriety grew , just like every classical hero , so did my ego . The look on the criminals faces when they saw me didn ’ t help with my crumbling psyche . Oh I had a power alright . The power to delude myself so greatly that I neglected what was important in my life . My waking life , away from the dream . <newline> <newline> Many years ago I had this girlfriend . I believe we were in love . At the beginning of my superhero career she was hinting at engagement . All she needed was a ring . It didn ’ t take her long to notice my late night comings and goings . She thought I was seeing another woman . I didn ’ t even fight the accusation . In my infinite sense of heroism I chose the mask over her . <newline> <newline> The stories they ran became a drug to fuel my ever growing audacity . I ’ d watch the police from a safe distance as they investigated my handiwork . They never saw me . I began taunting the crime bosses , leaving notes with emboldened threats I planned to make good on . I was an idiot . <newline> <newline> The part that gets me the most are the others . The copycats that inevitably came after me . Nobody had powers so they resulted to weapons . Always more of a hand to hand guy myself . Course I had the skills and know-how to survive , which is why I ’ m still talking to you today . If you go back and read the papers from then you ’ d know that wasn ’ t the case with everybody . I rationalized their deaths away to being their own damn faults . I mean no-one forced a 17 year old football star to dress up and try and take on a dozen armed robbers without backup . He just ... did it . If you think for even half a second you ’ re invincible with that mask on you ’ re already dead . Never the less , even if they chose for themselves I was the catalyst for their destruction . The destruction of families and relationships . <newline> Many tried to recruit me for various teams they were forming . Old and young members populated their ranks . They were so excited . It was sad . A few tried to kill me . Alot of people , criminal and ‘ hero ’ , died during those times . I tried not to kill , but I ’ m far from perfect . Sometimes it can ’ t be helped and I ’ m not proud . <newline> <newline> I wasn ’ t even the first you know ? Vigilantism might run in the family because I used to hear stories from my uncle about how my grandfather used to roam the streets of occupied Copenhagen during WW2 . Stalked the rooftops hunting Nazis while wearing an airman mask and a pair of razor iron wings . I looked into it one time , but could find little information . The Royal Devil they called him , because he wore a British bomber jacket on the few occurrences he was seen by someone who was able to make it out alive . Records showed he was gunned down during an assassination attempt on an officer , but my Uncle claims differently . He also claimed grandfather used those wings to fly . Most sources pointed to the Royal Devil as being an urban legend so I ’ m not sure what to believe . My father turned out to be no help when questioned about him . I got the feeling they were never especially close . <newline> <newline> You can say I was ... inspired . <newline> <newline> Don ’ t get me started on the villains . Monsters like Doctor Nucleos and The Bleeder were the only ones who probably got more spotlight than me . From causing millions in damage to slaughtering thousands they were by far the worst thing to ever come out of my essentrics . Dynamo was an elementary school teacher you know ? Hiding behind all that body armor she really let us see the true her . I broke every bone in my right hand I hit her so many times . Psychopath… <newline> <newline> I ’ ve been retired from crime fighting for nearly 15 years now . The superhero fad burned out quickly with the number of people who were crazy enough to partake in it . I ’ m one of the few that are still alive and not chained up in prison or the looney bin . <newline> <newline> I admit you and your friends have to be pretty resourceful to track me down after all this time . But you came for my advice and now you have it . If not for your own sake then for the sake of others . Don ’ t be a hero . <newline> <newline> Oh yeah , and seriously ; The Swans ? What kinda name is that ? <newline>

2,"( This is my first time posting here , so any feedback would be appreciated ! ) <newline> <newline> Damn , she looked good . <newline> <newline> Her hair constantly caressed her back in a way that made you envious , and her lips were full and always tilted up at the corner , as though she had a knockout smile always loaded in the chamber . Even contained in a jacket and overcoat something about her just seemed vibrant and alive . She saved a breathless , perfectly sincere laugh for those closest to her like I was . Or rather , like I ... used to be . <newline> <newline> I did n't expect to hear that laugh today . All I could do was watch and listen , willing her to say something , wanting the precarious balancing act to end . <newline> <newline> She looked me right in the eyes and told me she did n't love me anymore . <newline> <newline> But I did n't feel a thing . <newline> <newline> Wordlessly , I stood up and walked out of that shit-hole of a diner . Part of me must have known this was coming . Why else would I have asked to meet there ? We had n't eaten there since we were kids . Maybe I thought that the good memories would change her mind . I 'd even worn that stupid shirt she liked . As if an overcooked quarter pounder and some extra buttons were going to fix two years of distance and neglect . <newline> <newline> The frigid rain was quick to remind me that I 'd left my jacket , but what did it matter at that point ? I could n't have sat in that dump a moment longer anyway . It took all the energy I had left to make my footsteps match my heartbeat , and the faster my shoes pounded down the pavement , the less risk I had of seeing her again . Who cared if I got splashed by some taxi cab ? I had to move . The city around me was suffocating me more than ever . I 'd only ever agreed to move her because she wanted it , and now I was trapped . That hint of relief at the edge of her brow had dug itself deep into my memories , but that was n't what I was afraid of . Why was it so easy ? Why did n't I feel anything ? I knew what she 'd looked like , but I wonder what she saw when she looked at me . What had she seen in my eyes ? Contempt ? Sadness ? Nothing ? <newline> <newline> `` Probably just a whiny asshole , '' . <newline> <newline> My left foot slipped out behind me , leaving me breathless on my hands and knees . I craned my head back to see a man leaned up casually against the wall , taking a deep drag from his cigar . <newline> <newline> `` Maybe 'clumsy ' is a better adjective , '' . <newline> <newline> Straining against emotional and physical weight , I forced myself to my feet and looked quizzically at the man . Surely he could n't have been addressing my thoughts ? The well-trimmed snowy hair on his chin marked him as being in his late fifties at the least . Maybe he was just musing out loud to himself . <newline> <newline> `` No , I think I 'll settle on 'stupid ' , '' . <newline> <newline> His gray eyes met mine on that comment . From the sharpness in them it was clear that these were n't the idle ramblings of an old man . He was talking to me . <newline> <newline> `` 'Who are you ? ' 'What do you want ? ' 'How did you know ? ' , '' the old man mockingly imitated each question , barely able to contain his amusement after each one . <newline> <newline> `` But ... , '' I quietly stammered . <newline> <newline> `` Oooh , 'But ' , I love that one . Man 's method of standing firm when the world does n't do as he wishes , right ? '' He made no effort to hide his enjoyment this time . <newline> <newline> `` What ... , '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay , we 're getting closer , '' The man gestured encouragingly with his still-lit cigar . <newline> <newline> `` Why ... , '' I mumbled , confusion robbing me of my voice . <newline> <newline> `` That 's a better question ! '' He grinned approvingly . `` You see , David , I am what some people might call 'an engineer ' , but I am not an engineer I am THE engineer ! '' <newline> <newline> I pulled back my soaked black bangs to survey the surroundings . Maybe I actually was torn up over Natalie and this was how I was channeling it . It felt more likely that I 'd actually fallen and hit my head on the way down . However , I could n't find anyone else on the street to confirm that this old man was n't reading my mind and calling me by name . <newline> <newline> With his free hand he snapped two fingers in my face . `` Do you understand , David ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' I stated surely . Ironically , my uncertainty was my only certainty at this point . <newline> <newline> `` You will . I 'm going to show you how it all works , David . You 'll follow me and I 'll show you who pulls which strings and when . '' The smile was still evident on his face . It was clear he was excited about whatever he had just said . <newline> <newline> To punctuate his speech , he elbowed the door he 'd been leaned against ( I could 've sworn he was n't leaned against any door ) , and exposed a blinding white light to the world . I did n't have words to express my shock at this point . To be honest , I expected that I was suffering from some kind of emotional trauma . In my numbed state , I found it best to keep things simple . <newline> <newline> `` Why ? '' I repeated . <newline> <newline> This prompted a somehow more serious grin from the man/ imaginary figment . <newline> <newline> `` You 're not the only one who wants to know how the world sees him , '' . <newline> <newline> And then I saw nothing .

2,"“ Jesus Christ , Frank , could you watch where you ’ re going , please ? ” I scolded , annoyed at the frequent prodding on my back . “ That security line gives you at least a couple meters , no need to stab me in the back every few seconds . Tethered to a frickin ’ idiot. ” I muttered to myself , forgetting volume doesn ’ t translate through the our comlink . <newline> <newline> “ I know I am . And sorry , ” Frank muttered , nonchalant as ever . His head hovered low over his palm , reading a timer that ticked and beeped relentlessly . In his other hand he shielded the red dust from blocking his view . Protruding from the stomach of his suit was a long metal rod , at the end of it a cord that connected to me . So we wouldn ’ t lose each other out here . “ Soon the storm will be settled enough that we can see more than a few meters ahead of us. ” <newline> <newline> “ Thank God . When ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Several minutes , give or take . Maximum distance we ’ ll be able to see will probably be… Roughly twenty meters or so . Don ’ t get your hopes up . Are we still on the right track ? ” He inquired , unconsciously nudging my back again . <newline> <newline> I checked my digital compass . Damn red dust made it difficult to read , but I could just make out our markers and the location we were headed to . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , close enough at this point . Do we even know what it is we are looking for ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Nah , ” Frank replied from behind me . “ Supposedly we ’ ll know it when we see it . Control never saw it close up but they got some pictures of it , labeled it as a ‘ location of interest. ’ From what I ’ ve heard , it ’ s almost continuously been hidden in dust storms. ” <newline> <newline> “ Typical . We don ’ t know a damn. ” I exhaled in irritation . “ Well , it ’ s not like it ’ ll be hard to find , once this storm passes , ” kicking the red dirt as I spoke . “ There ain ’ t nothing out here for miles. ” <newline> <newline> We walked in silence for several minutes . The dust swirled and spiraled erratically , constantly leaving a faint red film on my helmet . I lazily nudged a small rock with my boot . <newline> <newline> “ You know what just occurred to me ? No one has walked on this damned Martian dirt in , well , probably forever . Ain ’ t that crazy ? Every rock , every thing you see , never been touched by a living thing . The entire planet , just an open , desolate history book waiting to be read. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yup. ” I got as a reply . The security line had gone taught , as Frank ’ s nose was buried in his palm again , attempting to read the timer . “ We got a minute or so until the storm peters out . Won ’ t be completely gone , but enough to see. ” <newline> <newline> “ Good . God knows it can only get better from here. ” I laughed at my own joke and bit back , as I got no response from Frank . Clearing my throat , I checked the compass . “ We ’ ve veered a bit to the right , let ’ s get back on course . It should be coming up in about half a kilometer , I believe. ” I halted , turned about 20° to my left and started again , pulling the cable and Frank closely behind me . <newline> <newline> “ What do you think we ’ re gon na find out here ? ” <newline> <newline> Frank sighed . “ I don ’ t know. ” <newline> <newline> “ I dunno either . A spaceship ? A large rock ? The Mayans ? Elvis Presley ? ” I exhaled dramatically . “ The possibilities are endless. ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m going to make an educated guess and say that three of those answers are probably wrong . Although , it would be nice to see Elvis perform. ” <newline> <newline> Silence again . <newline> <newline> We walked slowly , plodding our way through the now thin storm that danced all around us . We could see much farther now , nearly thirty or forty meters in total . I missed Earth , the sweet wind , and liveliness of it all . Everything moved in a calm ecstasy . Here , on Mars , well , you ’ d better like the ugly orange color of its dirt . <newline> <newline> And suddenly , like lightning out of a clear blue sky , we saw it . <newline> <newline> “ Oh , God. ” I muttered , unable to articulate anything other , hardly a breath escaping me . “ Is that… ? Oh , God… What the- ” <newline> <newline> “ I think that is… ” Frank agreed , dumbfounded , now beside me . “ We uh , should leave and tell Control right away . There is no , absolutely no logical explanation for this… ” He turned and started walking back , a quick , uncoordinated hobble , but the security line that linked us kept him from going too far away from me . I pulled him back , so I could examine it further . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> We had almost run into a massive pillar , roughly five or so meters high and just a couple wide . With a small gap in between came another , with a last massive stone lying horizontally on top , bridging the distance between the two . Sarsens . <newline> <newline> There were several other arrangements like this , in the form of a circle , with several more , larger stones placed in the middle . <newline> <newline> I could only think of one possibility . <newline> <newline> “ You were right about the rock. ” Frank ’ s voice was barely a whisper . <newline> <newline> I nodded . “ It ’ s a Goddamn Stonehenge. ” <newline>

2,"She inherited a blank canvas and a selection of paint . Using only her fingers , She spread the colors across the empty expanse . Her choices , though never given much thought , always seemed to fit themselves into place among each other . A dash of red there . Strokes of green , purple , and blue . Yellow and orange distributed sparingly . And suddenly , what were once abstract constructs , simple collections of lines and shapes , assembled themselves , without moving , into something familiar . The red , soaking between the tightly woven threads of the canvas , spread and expanded like blood in milk . The greens , purples and blues changing slightly , to close any gaps . The yellow and orange wandering aimlessly about the whole thing , adding a bit of flavor and variety where it was needed . And there it was . The world , all the men and women in their cities , the beasts roaming across the surface of the world , the leviathans writhing beneath the waves . She gazed upon it , satisfied , knowing that as long as She continued to watch and nurture Her creation , it would grow and flower into something more beautiful and complex than even she could imagine . <newline> <newline> And so it did , pruned by war and famine , nurtured with bountiful harvests and great rains . The colors moved , expanding and contracting , inching across the canvas . The men , however , were something else . They resisted and edited the natural flow of change , setting boundaries and pulling pieces of the land where they did not belong . They discovered ways to change the paint entirely , yellows turning to purple , reds shifting to green . This , She decided , should not go unchecked . She wished they would be more like the beasts , who simply roamed the space they were given . And as She wished it , it became so . The men became beasts , adopting claws , talons , and thick hides in place of their hands , feet , and smooth , hairless skin . This halted them for some time , as they adjusted to the fact that they were no longer separate from the eyes in the dark and the wings in the sky . They still erected monuments , and touched up the paint here and there , but no more of this mucking about with stargazing and stabbing each other with sharp things . It still happened of course , but She decided that it may as well be left that way . <newline> <newline> Now that they were more akin to the things that ran around on all four legs , they decided that instead of looking where the paint was n't , they should explore the business of touching up the paint they had . They were not all very good at this . Often causing monumental shifts in the very shape of the canvas itself . Mountains sprung up in lakes , rivers of lava incinerated unsuspecting fish , and showers of stars blasted whole villages off the face of the painting . Sometimes they would decide that their particular group was better than another , and would attempt to forcefully remove each other from the canvas . She was not particularly happy about this , seeing her creations be wiped from existence , and so the weather was harsh , blankets of ice and storms of heat matching Her mood . <newline> <newline> Eventually the little men , who now resembled beasts walking on their hind legs and using their front limbs to do almost everything BUT walking , settled into a sort of rut . One city or empire would discover something , a new form of magic , a leap in logic or mathematics , or unearth some long-buried secret . But She wanted them to stay with her , just the way they had been , living simple lives in simple places , so She could watch without trouble . She would get mad when they changed the colors of the paint , or tried to leave the painting entirely . There would be a disaster . A revolt . A storm . A famine . A plague . Whatever this city had discovered would be lost . Nomads and travelers would build new homes in the ruins , and the cities grew like piles of leaves . Slowly , each layer would be covered by the next , and each layer would move a little farther from the top every few years . This went on for hundreds , thousands of years . She did n't count . <newline> <newline> One morning She was painting sunrises . The yellows and oranges and reds gaining ground on the blues and purples , the greens and browns staying well out of the way . Looking to the foreground , which in this case was a small city on an almost smaller island , she saw something very strange indeed . Long ago the men had been given fur , hide , scales , wings , tails , and all manner of claws and talons . But there , in that little opening between two squares of brick and stone , was a little boy . He had none of the things she had given the men . He had a tuft of soot-black hair , pink skin turning brown in the places it should , and little round eyes . Green ones , like fruit that has just formed on the vine and has n't got any juice yet . He had little stubby fingers and toes , but no claws . He was nearly naked , save for a pair of rags tied like a loincloth . He had no wings or tail , and no antlers sprouting from his skull . She looked closer , seeing the contents of the little hornless head . He was thinking about food . He was wondering when he had eaten last . He had n't eaten that day , nor the day before . She considered this , and as she did so , a passing cart hit a small bump in the road , sending a loaf of bread tumbling in his direction . <newline> <newline> She smiled , and so did he .

2,"The moon shone pale as it reached its zenith . He sat , motionless , staring out of the window and into the darkness beyond , searching the frozen wastes for a sign , a call . <newline> <newline> He turned back to the table and his eyes , in the dim candlelight , rested on several letters with their red seals broken . He picked one up , opened it and read the words that had been branded into his mind for the past few hours . <newline> <newline> His hands shook , anticipation rising in his soul and stirring something that he felt had been dormant for the past century . Letter in hand , he eagerly placed it over the candle 's dying flame and watched as it caught fire . <newline> <newline> He smiled , amused at the sight of the fire dancing as it engulfed it , taking away decades worth of work . He thought it strange how the words that he had hung onto for so long easily disintegrated and turned to ash . It made him think of how easily everything could have fallen apart . However , to his surprise , everything worked out well- as well as it could have -and surpassed his expectations . His plans were going smoothly , and now all it would take is to move a few more pieces until he could settle things once and for all . <newline> <newline> Snapping from his reverie , he found the entire document to have started burning alight . The fingers that gripped the document had been long overwhelmed with flames , but he felt no pain or fear . Swiftly , he crushed it underneath his hands , flames and all , and instead of an intense sensation of heat , he felt it grow cold as ice . Satisfied , he placed his hands out the window , opened them , and watched as black flecks of burnt paper were carried away in the wind . He repeated this process for the other letters until his table was finally empty and his palms were stained black with ash . <newline> <newline> Once finished , he moved over to his wardrobe and opened the lavishly carved and studded wooden door . Taking out his blue robes , he changed from his nightgown . He pulled the soft hood of the robe over his head , and felt it shield his ears from the bitter chill coming through the window . He knew the hood was made of fur , but he found it hard to decern from which animal it was . It saddened him to think of how little of this place he knew despite of his decades long stay as councilman . <newline> <newline> When he had first arrived , to his eyes , the snowy landscape seemed barren and hostile . Teeming with life fierce enough to fight the cold . However , his years of living here had chipped away at the preconceptions . Staring out the window , he found a solemn beauty in the landscape stretching before him . The moonlight gave beauty to the snow covered rooftops in the city . The evergreen forest past the walls , and the tall mountains that beset its east and west also glittered and beyond that to the north , the pale light shone the icy wastes that stretched for miles ahead . <newline> <newline> People toiled out in the frozen wastes , wishing for a coat like his and a chance to live comfortably within the walls , free from danger . <newline> <newline> 'No more . ' he thought . <newline> <newline> It was finally time for him to leave and to put an end to the chase that had claimed the twilight years of his life . He knew of the danger he would be leaving Saernord in , and for the past few years , had contemplated hard upon his actions , the morality of it , whether or not he would be truly doing the right thing . However , he countered that thought by thinking about the consequences of staying . He knew war was coming either way , and with a new threat at the helm , nothing could stop it , not even him , if he left it lie for too long . <newline> <newline> Something stirred in his chest . Despite his infamy across the known world for being powerful , the magic in his veins did nothing to suppress his age and the problems that came with it . His heart pumped , and his breathing was labored . He took a deep breath , and reached into one of his pockets to take out a potion . Taking a short swig , he felt himself calm . The feeling of intense anxiety had been a new sensation that had arisen only a few weeks ago . It was the first time where he could feel the full weight of his decision , knowing well that there was no going back . He felt as if he were leaving them to fate without his guidance , and found it a hard reality to accept because he knew there was only one thing he could do , trust . Trust in the people he had known for years that they could hold long enough for him to finally quell the threat in its infancy . <newline> <newline> He stared out the window and into the darkness once more . <newline> <newline> `` Where is he ? '' he thought . <newline> <newline> Despite of his age , he still trusted his eyes . <newline> <newline> *Flash* <newline> <newline> He jerked up , his posture straight . He saw it , he swore he did . <newline> <newline> *Flash* <newline> <newline> There it was again . His eyes rested on the slope of the mountain to the east , and continued to wait just to be sure . <newline> <newline> *Flash Flash* <newline> <newline> He smiled , that was it . Over time the flashing became more frequent , and the light became more then just a beacon in the darkness . To him it was a call to action . It was time . <newline> <newline> He put out the candle , and without so much as a look back , he left the room . <newline> <newline> EDIT : Fixed the formatting <newline> <newline>

2,"Joseph “ Josh ” Lyonnais squinted through the rain at the address the housing agency had given him , and looked back up at the dull brass numbers hanging on the door of the apartment across the street . <newline> <newline> 220C Caada Street was a drab , twisted , two storied building with bulging bay windows and protruding eves , giving it an impression of fallen grandeur . <newline> <newline> The front garden was a dreary , depressing affair , overgrown with <newline> weeds which were choking the life out of the neglected shrubbery . <newline> <newline> The house might have been impressive once , but the ravages of time had turned it into the withered husk he saw today . <newline> <newline> Josh pulled his wide-brimmed hat lower to keep the rain off and crossed the street cautiously . You never know if those things on the road are only pretending to be cars . <newline> He checked his surroundings out of habit and only entered the apartment when he did not sense any immediate threat . <newline> <newline> The inside of the house was blessedly dry after the constant drizzle outside , and Josh sighed in relief as he hung his greatcoat at the door . <newline> A raven-haired woman greeted him as he turned around . She was wearing a light grey business suit over a dark silk blouse , paired with a tasteful black skirt . An onyx necklace completed the ensemble , giving her a severe countenance . <newline> <newline> “ Ms . Ravenwood , ” nodded Josh in her direction . <newline> <newline> “ Mr . Lyonnais , ” replied Demi Ravenwood , handing Josh a key . “ We had a bit of inconvenience finding someone willing to rent out an apartment for less than 50 silver griffins a month , but luckily for you , we have another client who ’ s also willing to share the rent . She ’ s upstairs. ” <newline> <newline> Josh nodded his consent and started climbing up the stairs . He stopped halfway and sniffed a few times . Was that the smell of… sage ? He shrugged mentally and continued . He had nothing against sage . <newline> <newline> As Josh reached the top of the stairs , he saw a svelte woman cleansing the house with a smudge stick , her every movement a graceful dance . <newline> <newline> She was dressed in a formfitting black leather jerkin laced up at the front with matching long pants . A bracelet of uncut white quartz streaked with midnight blue glittered at her left wrist , highlighting her pale skin . <newline> <newline> “ Hi , I ’ m Joseph Lyonnais , ” Josh said to announce his presence . <newline> <newline> “ Hi , ” she replied shortly , continuing with the ritual . <newline> <newline> Josh took the opportunity to study his potential room-mate . Her brown hair was drawn back loosely in a sensible bun , but calling it brown would be like calling garnet red . It shimmered , it flashed , it shifted under the light , drawing the eye immediately . <newline> <newline> She had a heart-shaped face with high cheekbones and a wide forehead . Her soft mouth said that she was vulnerable , the set of her chin implied stubbornness . <newline> <newline> Her bow-shaped nose was flamboyant , but elegant . Her eyes were a piercing green , bringing to mind the deep green glades of summer , and flecked with gold which sparkled with life and humor . Her eyebrows were sharply defined , with downwards slanting inner brows , giving her a perpetual look of deep thought . <newline> <newline> “ Ferule or Soledad ? ” she asked abruptly , startling Josh out of his reverie . <newline> <newline> “ Excuse me ? ” he asked , puzzled . <newline> <newline> “ I asked , did you come from Ferule or Soledad ? ” she repeated with a touch of impatience . <newline> <newline> “ … Soledad , ” Josh replied after a slight hesitation . “ How did you know ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Your stance is wary , alert , ” she replied , gesturing towards him . “ But not so tense that you would be slowed if action is needed . Relaxed , in a deadly way . You are evidently not of noble or merchant birth , so the fact that you are looking for board here in one of the Upper Cities where one needs a small fortune to pay for the rent must mean that you ’ ve made said fortune with your own hands . Your hands are slightly bent at the elbows , near your hips and ready to draw , suggesting a certain familiarity , shall we say , with firearms. ” <newline> <newline> She paused here and grabbed Josh ’ s hat . “ The mend hole here in your hat and various other clues from your clothing , ” she said , pointing to his well-worn denim pants , “ cemented the hypothesis that you ’ ve made your money through gunfights . This narrowed it down to a dozen countryside towns where duels are still legal , but the burrs clinging to the side of your boots sealed the deal . That particular breed , with its distinct thorns and grip , exists only in the western parts of the Kingdom and so the only two possible towns you could have come from are either Ferule or Soledad . Ayria Hawthorn , <newline> at your service. ” She ended it with a little bow . <newline> <newline> “ Very impressive , ” said Josh with an unmistakable tone of admiration . <newline> <newline> Ayria dimpled with obvious pleasure at the praise of her craft . “ So , did I get everything right ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Quite , ” replied Josh . “ But you missed something which I am a bit proud of. ” <newline> <newline> Ayria cocked her head sideways in puzzlement . “ What ’ s it ? I can ’ t really discern anything else of note from you. ” <newline> <newline> Josh grinned with sudden mischief . “ That ’ s for me to know , and you to find out. ” <newline> <newline> “ And find out I will , ” said Ayria confidently .

2,"**This is something I wrote down years ago in a creative moment . I have a lot of ideas built around it but nothings ever happened with it . Let me know what you think . The dialogue is bad to me . It always feels clumsy or contrived . ** <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The mad woman lay dying on the straw mat . In a sense she was dying of a wound dealt to her months ago . Almost eight months ago her village was raided by northmen . The low huts set ablaze , the men slaughtered and the women taken by force . The lucky ones were used and left behind . The unlucky ones were taken with the raiders when they left . She was one of the “ lucky ” ones . <newline> <newline> Since that day she had hardly been seen around the village . Being the only shaman they had she was sorely missed . She roamed the woods , hid in the hills , came to the village only in the dead of night and then only to steal food or gaze longingly at the hut her husband now slept in alone . Last night she arrived again in the dead of night but instead of slipping away quietly she cried out in pain . Her apprentice , now the only shaman they had , came running out and found her fat with child . <newline> <newline> As blood pooled between her thighs and her vision clouded she held her small child tightly to her breast loving it more than anyone else ever would in his life , even if only for moments . As she slipped in and out of consciousness she heard two men speaking near the entrance to her hut . <newline> <newline> “ She is mad Running Buck . I do n't care how you love her , she is mad and her child is the affliction that drove her to it . The child must die , or he may spread the disease to us all. ” Said the smaller man . Slight of build and with a wiry frame his every move was suspicious . Some said it was his fault the northmen came at all , with all his slinking about talking to the tribes in the north . <newline> <newline> Running Buck replied , “ You are right Vicious Wind , Moonlight in the Water is mad , but it was the attack on her body not the child that drove her to it . If you touch him , or her , I will tie you to a tree and rub honey on your body , then we will see who makes you scream louder , the giant tree ants or the bears. ” Running buck was nearly seven feet tall , with long black hair flowing over his bulging muscles he was easily the strongest man in the village . He was very capable of carrying out his threat and angry enough to do it . If the woman dying in the hut could remember his love she would have been proud , but for the moment all she could remember was the now endless chatter of the spirits from these last months and her child 's heartbeat . <newline> <newline> “ I do n't know why you argue ” , said the apprentice , ” She wo n't survive the night and as small as the child is without her it wo n't make it a week. ” The two men huffed and glared and the apprentice shaman with looks that would kill for intruding on their argument . <newline> <newline> As she listened intently to the beat of Cunning Bears heart ( Cunning Bear was what she would name him when she was n't feeling so sleepy ) she heard words that cut through her madness like a sharp spear through a deers hide . ” I 'll not have the child contaminate our village Running Buck , whether you 'allow ' it or not I 'm going to the elders with this and my father will have the child removed , you ca n't stand against us all ! ” <newline> <newline> As Vicious Wind turned to leave Moonlight in the Water sat bolt upright and let out a shriek that froze him in his tracks . He looked back as she began chanting in the spirit language higher and lower her voice dipped and weaved around the words . As she chanted , she spit in her right hand , scooped up dirt , and dipped her fingers in the pooling blood . The three onlookers stood horrified as she drew two overlapping runes on the child 's forehead with her fingers . When she was done the runes faded from view and she collapsed on her mat , seeming dead . Just as the apprentice stepped nearer to feel for her breath Moonlight in the Water 's eyes snapped open and she turned to face the huts entrance , staring directly at Vicious Wind . <newline> <newline> “ Let all bear witness , any man who brings harm to my child will wish himself dead as many times as there are stars in the sky . His wives will be barren , his children will sicken , his prey will always hear the tread of his feet and his crops will lie fallow . He will die weak , alone , sick and in pain before he is thrown into the darkest corner of the spirit realm where I will await him eagerly to teach him true misery then . By the wind in my breath , the water of my body , the fire in my blood and the earth beneath me I curse that man. ” <newline> <newline> They waited . Almost three hundred breaths they waited watching her watching them , till her apprentice stepped forward and touched her neck . “ She is cold with death ! ” , stepping away slowly she spoke hurriedly , ” She was strong with the spirits , this death curse will be as true as any you have ever heard told round the fires . I leave you two to decide what to do about the child . I will have nothing to do with him myself ! ” and with that she turned and fled . <newline>

2,"He awoke dehydrated . It was the kind of morning that made the dew evaporate almost as quickly as it settled . It seemed as if today the clouds would require convincing to hang in the sky . Robin broke his fast with eggs on toast , his favorite . He filled his canteen , tended to the foul and went out to the fields before the sun got the jump on him . Luckily he had already turned up the ground along the perimeter to serve as a fire break a few days before . He was waiting for the right day to raze the straw and stubble . That day had come . <newline> <newline> He was always entranced by flames . Throughout the season this was the time to which he most looked forward . After reaping , the crops must be burned to give way to the new seeds . He could not reason why he looked forward to this time . It was either seeing the destruction of his creation , or seeing the possibilities brought to bear in the flames ; the promise of a new crop . In any order , he could not be bothered with wondering which it was and instead resigned him to watching the fire dance along the rows of wheat . He kept a close eye on the fire break . Flame while it may be a beautiful friend , is a relentless foe . <newline> <newline> Robin came home covered in ash and smelling of smoke . It was a good day of work . A day you could look back on and be proud . He set about to preparing his supper . The Rolands had recently butchered one of their cattle and had offered a few cuts in exchange for some seed and wheat . It was a trade Robin made happily as it had been a plentiful season for him . He sat at the empty table and began about enjoying his meal . <newline> <newline> “ They have found you. ” <newline> <newline> Robin was startled by the words . Not by their content , this meant nothing to him , but by their source . A woman stood in the doorway . She was half masked by shadows cast from the candles that sat upon the sills . She glided towards him as if on air and sat near him at the table . Once bathed in the candlelight he decided that she was indeed beautiful , yet he could not shake the feeling she encouraged within him . It was as if his very soul was writhing . For a moment he felt his mind wander back to the flames of the morning . <newline> <newline> “ Leave or I ’ ll – “ <newline> <newline> “ You will what ? Rend me like you have that meat ? And what do you suppose you would fight me with , hero , ” she half chuckled , “ your legendary blade ? ” <newline> <newline> Robin glanced at the wall behind him at the sword that hung there . Rusted to its mounting , he doubted he could loosen it from its place ; much less defend himself with it . <newline> <newline> “ Who are you ? ” <newline> <newline> “ It does not matter who I am Robin Walhart . I am not the one they seek , ” the woman mocked . <newline> <newline> “ Why are you here ? I don ’ t suppose you are to join me in my meal. ” <newline> <newline> “ No I suppose not , though I would not mind the company of someone such as you . Dull as you may seem , you and I would indeed be the most curious of dinner companions. ” <newline> <newline> “ The only curiosity would be why I fed you instead of sending you on your way. ” <newline> <newline> “ Ah , at last you show a semblance of wit . If we are lucky they have underestimated your resolve as I have your humor. ” <newline> <newline> He did not respond . <newline> <newline> “ It is time for you to go , ” the woman said . While before Robin was intrigued by her playful cadence ; he was now unsettled by the sudden change to sincerity . <newline> <newline> “ It is fortunate for us I arrived in advance . Once I was able to discern your whereabouts it was not long after they were able to as well . I suppose you could blame this on me for uncovering the way , but I would rather you did not . The fires you set today did not help either ; they do tend to be attracted to the flames . I suppose you found them to be completely necessary ? But that is neither here nor there . I need you to survive , Robin. ” <newline> <newline> For some unknown reason he believed her . While his head screamed out that she was untrustworthy , the rest of his body was compelled to listen . He began making ready to leave . As he prepared his things she stood in the doorway motionless . She looked out into nothing as if she could see through the very earth and out to the other side . As he finished his rushed preparations he found himself staring at the rusty blade hung on the wall . <newline> <newline> “ They are coming . It is best that you leave now , ” the woman said without turning . <newline> <newline> “ And where shall I go ? ” he questioned . <newline> <newline> “ Anywhere but here , ” was her response . “ Oh and take the blade… ” <newline> <newline> Robin reached for the sword and tore it from its fittings . <newline> <newline> “ …you will need it , ” she whispered under her breath . <newline> <newline> And with that she disappeared . <newline> <newline> In his bones Robin had known he wanted more than to tend crops . It was a simple life ; one that he had enjoyed thoroughly . Still , he knew that there was something greater than this . He was waiting for the right day to be released from the bonds of normality . That day had come .

2,"Dying should have been the easy part . <newline> <newline> The last good thing I remember was that I had hot water in the prison shower , a treat I don ’ t get most days . This distracted me enough from the last thing I wish I remembered : the shock of a prison shank entering my lower back at the kidneys and a heavy weight pushing me face first into the slick concrete floor . Pain shooting up and down my body stopped the bellow of pain and primal anger , and also stopped my arms from trying to catch the body weight of me and my attacker from the floor that seemed to be rushing to meet us . The crunch of my face impacting the concrete was the last thing I did remember , as the world and the pain of some sharpened toothbrush faded away into blackness . <newline> <newline> As a lapsed Catholic on death row , I had often imagined the fade to black moment would have been followed by some Pearly Gates , a swift kick in the ass by Saint Peter , and an indeterminate amount of time roasting in fire and brimstone with a nice side order of whatever fears a devil could figure out I hated the worst . <newline> <newline> What I didn ’ t expect was fluorescent lighting . I didn ’ t expect a nice comfy prison industries bed . And I sure as hell didn ’ t expect a TV to be installed the corner of what most people who haven ’ t been to jail would have called a jail cell . Oh sure , it had the solid concrete painted with cheap paint , and a door that looked normal but I could tell was reinforced , but it was too big to be a jail . Sad as it was to say , I ’ d seen enough to know the difference . <newline> <newline> Sitting up , I felt creaks everywhere , as if I had been asleep for years , or if my body had been put in plaster for a while and this was the first chance it had to move in quite some time . Feeling the scar above where the prison shank entered my body told me that perhaps that thought of me not moving for a while was closer to the truth than me being in hell . <newline> <newline> It was during this self-inventory that I had one of the biggest shocks of my life . <newline> The TV kicked on and the sound of a gravelly man ’ s voice came from every direction in my cell : <newline> <newline> DO NOT BE ALARMED . SOMEONE WILL BE ALONG SHORTLY TO RELEASE YOU FROM YOUR CELL . EXPLANATIONS WILL BE GIVEN , BUT ASK NO QUESTIONS TO THE PERSONNEL TAKING YOU FROM YOUR CELL . FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS THEY GIVE , FOR PUNISHMENTS ARE SWIFT AND PAINFUL . THEY WILL TAKE YOU TO PROCESSING , WHERE YOU WILL HAVE THE SITUATION EXPLAINED TO YOU . ESCAPE IS NOT AN OPTION . <newline> <newline> By the time the word “ BE ” was uttered , I saw that the TV was feeding me a picture of my cell . During the bit about ‘ escape not being an option ’ I received another shock in the more literal sense . Electricity flowed from a collar around my neck I hadn ’ t even noticed yet . The Tasering pulsed enough to stop me from doing anything , but not a constant shock that would make me unable to hear what was being said . The shocks ended when the speech did and control of my body seemed to get back to normal . <newline> <newline> I leapt off the bed and paced around the tiny room partially to get the creaks out and take the edge off the shock , and partially because I wanted to be as hard a target as possible . <newline> <newline> 15 minutes of me pacing around showed me that the announcer ’ s definition of ‘ shortly ’ differed greatly from mine . I hopped into bed , figuring that if they wanted me , at least I could be comfortable in the mean time . My internal clock said that I spent about 3 and a half minutes on the bed relaxing before the announcer spoke again . <newline> <newline> JAMES HARRISON SAWYER : STAND UP . FACE THE WALL AWAY FROM THE DOOR . KNEEL IN FRONT OF IT . CROSS YOUR ANKLES AND LEAN FORWARD PLACING YOUR HANDS IN PLAIN VIEW ON THE WALL . YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO COMPLY . <newline> <newline> Plan A : Attack . Seeing they had a video feed to my room , I knew that jumping the man opening the door wasn ’ t an option , as I would probably be tasered and/or tranquilized like an animal . <newline> <newline> Plan B : Non-violent protest . Staying on my bed might be the easiest plan but would only invite more mystery tasings . Pain endured for no reason is stupidity writ large , so this option was swiftly crossed off my list . <newline> <newline> Plan C : Bide my time . Every prison guard gets complacent sometime , and that would be the time to initiate my first choice in these situations : hit them hard , hit them fast , hit them a lot . <newline> <newline> I can ’ t say my options were the best , but ultimately they were better than they were the previous 24 hours . Time spent in jail teaches you is to endure hardships patiently , as I learned many years ago . Railing against the injustice of my imprisonment was a long faded bitter pill I taste with every injustice . After enough time you learn to deal with it , or you go insane and maybe vengeful . If there was a single person to focus my vengeance upon , I ’ d investigate the possibility , but when a system that is unchanging does it , you ’ ll go crazy trying to change it .

2,"# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) <newline> <newline> The shrieking whine and flashing lights of the warning alarms filled the cockpit of Corporal Quentin Langley 's battlemech , his knuckles bone white as they clenched the throttle and control stick in a frantic attempt to avoid toppling over into the water . The radar flickered under the barrage of missiles , the damage readouts showing a seemingly endless list of crippled systems in red and orange . A burst hose hissed steam behind his head , the heat adding to the already furnace-like temperatures . The armored glass screen of his cockpit was cracked like a spider web , the silvery lines obscuring much of his view . <newline> <newline> *Light gauss rifle out , LRM 's shot to hell ... sensors done for . Shit . * <newline> <newline> His *Shadow Hawk* was half-leaning against the side of a building like some drunken iron giant , its black and grey armor scorched and pitted where it was n't torn away all together . The right knee actuator was a crushed mess of gears and myomer , each shift grinding the broken parts against bent armor . <newline> <newline> *I left home for this ? * Langley asked himself as he struggled to get his mech upright and moving but every time he did all he succeeded in was causing a rain of bricks and broken glass to shower upon his machine , scraping and denting the armor further . <newline> <newline> The sound of an approaching battlemech tore him from his self-pity , bringing his attention towards the titan footfalls that grew louder and louder , bits of rubble and dust being knocked loose with each step . Turning the corner was a fifty ton *Trebuchet* painted tan and burnish gold , the colors of the 10th Regulan Hussars and their current foe . <newline> <newline> `` Oh for fuck 's sake ... '' Langley swore and raised his mech 's right arm , firing his medium lasers as they shifted over the massive dun colored shape . Twin beams of green light blazed just a hundred meters , scoring molten parallel lines in the *Trebuchet's* battered armor . As his lasers began to recharge he saw the Regulan mech raise its own lasers , the light of the setting sun glinting off its green lens . <newline> <newline> *Urk ! * <newline> <newline> Just then a shadow soared over Langley 's *Shadow Hawk* and landed in a titanic crash , the roar of fiery jumpjets doing little to soften the impact . It was a fellow fifty-five tonner , a *Wolverine* painted in the same black and grey color scheme . From the Streak Short-Range Missile launcher mounted on its left shoulder came six streams of smoke , the missiles smashing against the enemy *Trebuchet's* torso and buckling already damaged armor . A medium laser added to the assault , the concentrated energy burning through plate and myomer . <newline> <newline> * '' Trouble , Corporal ? `` * The *Wolverine's* pilot asked , squeezing another burst of laser at his foe as he strafed right , using his weaponless left arm as a shield . <newline> <newline> The Regulan foe tried to shake off the surprise of this newcomer , firing its quartet of lasers in a lethal display of weapons . Most burned harmlessly into the building 's face , the fourth barely clipping the *Wolverine's* leg . It was too close for the Regulan to use its long-range missiles , the same could not be said for the *'Rine's* main weapon . At a hundred and fifty meters away it was at a perfect distance , the Heavy PPC glowing for a fraction of a second before it fired . Super-concentrated ion particles leaped from the barrel of the weapon to the enemy *Trebuchet , * a stream of man-made lightning flashing across the distance in a thunderous whip crack . The cockpit shattered into a thousand whirling pieces , the armored glass becoming a lethal spray of razor sharp sharpnel that tore through flesh and bone . The mechwarrior was no more , reduced to a bloody mist of flesh and flecks of white bone and liberally painted across the inside of the cockpit . <newline> <newline> Deprived of its pilot the battlemech toppled over , smashing through the roof and side of a pharmacy in a spray of tiles and concrete . The triumphant *Wolverine* half turned towards Langley 's cripple machine , raising its Heavy PPC in a slight salute . Along with the coffin and cross longswords on its shoulder was a personal emblem , a black robed phantom with the skull of a jackal , wielding a pitted scythe as if to reap the souls of men . <newline> <newline> * '' Get up , Corporal . You still have power , you have weapons . Grave Guards do n't quit , they fight . So get up and be the last thing these bastards ever see . Fight ! `` * <newline> <newline> With that he turned his *Wolverine* and fired at some unseen foe , the lightning of the PPC blazing in the dying light . Quentin Langley bit back a curse and urged his mech upright , leveling its brace of medium lasers towards the nearing enemy . Out of the cloud of dust and smoke came a stream of tracers and lasers , flashing past his cockpit in a wash of colors . He fired and roared wordless defiance , his lasers firing as quickly as they could cycle . Beside him the *Wolverine* fought , standing out in the open heedless of the dangers , like some iron hero of myth and legend , silhouetted by the fires raging throughout the city . Its pilot screamed on the general channel , a snarling challenge to all comers . <newline> <newline> * '' Death flies on swift wings ! Hear its black wings approach ! None of you shall live to see the sun rise tomorrow . Fight ! Fight and die ! `` *

2,"This prompt is like a message from on high telling me to finally get started on the prologue idea I 've been kicking around for my in-progress novel . Critiques are welcome . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> Every fool and child knows that crossroads are magical places . Places where one might encounter things not easily found elsewhere . Where the desperate might cut a deal with a demon , and where the world-weary might find themselves crossing into another place or time . Every fool and child knows these things , but sometimes the wise forget them . <newline> <newline> The crossroads in question did not look like a crossroads to most who saw it . It looked like a simple dirt path , bisecting a field full of long grass that waved in the wind , the Earth 's flowing green hair . On the path , at a seemingly random spot , there was a little town . But the townspeople could see the other half of the crossroads , as could the few who traveled upon it . <newline> <newline> The dirt path led from nowhere to nowhere , and the other road , which was made of something far less substantial than earth , led to just about any destination one could think of . And an inn had sprung up where the two roads met , as inns are wont to do . Later , a little town had built itself around the inn . The town was just like any other town , and the inn like any other . Horses brayed in their stables . Fields of crops grew . But if you were observant , and you walked along the wheat , you would notice something strange about it . It was . . . Wispy , almost . Shimmering . Almost like it was not quite real enough , or perhaps a bit too real . And if you walked through the horses ' stables , or among the cows in the field , you would see a fierce , wild intelligence in the animals ' eyes . <newline> <newline> The inn at the crossroads was called , simply , the Inn . And beside the hearth in its cozy taproom sat a man . This was true in a general sense , though the man often traveled around the town . But no matter where he was , if someone were to call on him , or even just walk into the Inn at an unexpected hour , they would always find him there , sitting by the hearth . <newline> <newline> The man was Storyteller , and every night he earned his name . The crowd in the Inn was always just right for the story at hand . No more than twelve people and no fewer than sixteen . The faces changed , but there were always a few familiar ones . <newline> <newline> Storyteller had his own names for the townspeople . There was Thinker , who sat in the back of the room with a mug of ale in his lap and a pensive expression on his face . Ploughman , a tough , hard-working farmer whose harvests always seemed poor , but who ploughed on nonetheless . His brother Harvester , who , unlike his kinsman , could sow one seed and get three plants . And Barkeep , of course , who kept everything in order at their little Inn . <newline> <newline> And then there was Storyteller 's favorite audience member , a little girl he called Wonder . The only little girl in town , as a matter of fact . She always came to hear his stories . Tonight she seemed especially eager . <newline> <newline> `` Are you ready ? Are you ready yet ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Almost , little one . '' Storyteller gave her a smile . He stood up and gave a dramatic cough , as was his custom . The room fell silent but for Wonder , who tried to say something else but was unable to make any sound but a squeal of delight . Storyteller turned his smile again to her , but this time it was tinged with sadness . <newline> <newline> In moments the girl , and everyone else in the Inn , would be trapped by his story . Their minds enslaved , unable to leave even figuratively , unable to think of anything else . Storyteller did n't think anyone could perceive this but himself , and still , it pained him greatly . He tried to at least spin his stories in a way that was worthy of this power , but who could be worthy of such terrible control ? If only he could stop the telling . But no , he had tried . . . Storyteller reflected sadly on these things for a moment , as he often did , and then Wonder 's voice pulled him back . <newline> <newline> `` What 's it about , tonight ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , you 're in for a treat . It 's a new one . I have a whole set of them for you . The Tales of the Frostlands , I 'm calling them . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oooooh , '' the little girl dragged the word out earnestly but absurdly , her eyes full of light . `` *Who* is it about ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well . . . It 's about a lot of people , I suppose . But I 'm in it , '' Storyteller grinned , `` I 'm my favorite character , in fact . Are you ready ? '' <newline> <newline> Wonder simply nodded . <newline> <newline> `` Then listen . Listen . '' <newline> *** <newline> *** <newline> <newline> **Edit : ** I hear you all loud and clear in re : to changing 'more ' and 'fewer ' . I give a short explanation in the comments below as to why I wrote it that way . That said , I can see that it clearly does n't work as intended for most ( all ? ) readers even when in context . I 'll work on that . <newline> <newline> Edit 2 : I really want to thank everyone individually , but at the same time I do n't want to go crazy in the replies below . So if you gave me positive feedback or constructive criticism and I did n't thank you , I 'll do so now . Thank you . <newline> <newline> <newline> Later today , maybe much later but definitely today , I 'll have Chapter 1 posted on my subreddit , which is the same as my username ( /r/ivangrozny ) <newline>

2,"He had bright green eyes , intelligent and buried amongst a midnight mane of curls and beard . They and he seemed old , though face around them was youthful ; old and sad and so reminiscent of the retired soldiers gathered around their fires and beers watching young recruits march in glory and shadow . They had seen the future of these youths in their own past , and said nothing . The wild man before me said nothing . He ’ d saved my life , driven away a great beast intent upon my life with a flash of power and fury and said not a word the entire while . Where were the marks of his trade ? The lines of power , and talismans , contracts written into flesh or crystals focussing the stuff of creation ? I had these things all about my person as I strode into the wild places of Ystra ’ s land -- confident in my nascent might . And there , striding into the murk of old growth and new death , I met a thing of teeth and blood . Chants learned from the sorcerers of mark were meaningless against scales earned from birth , contracts with spirits reneged in the face of such malignance and tattoos carved deep onto my arms and legs rendered blank . I was to die there , but for this wild man , with wild black clothing and wild black hair . So he said nothing and left , and I said nothing and followed . <newline> <newline> The wild man with no trappings and no foci and no arcane agreements set a slow pace , and I accompanied him . We stopped often , to examine a beetle or a flower or merely to sit in silence for awhile . He spoke not at all , and I could draw nothing from him . In this way two of us penetrated the great forests and walked in the places where gods lived and evil things laired , yet neither bothered us . I saw no sign of dark things in dark places , though through dark places we walked . There is great beauty in the ancient forest -- trees like towers clad in silken ivy and glowing veils , blushing for each other and for us ; quiet flowers , singing in the shadows of great webs and age ; winking lilies , tethered to shores of glass and mystery , wiling away their lives unmolested , lazy and new . There too we saw things of horror , nightmares on many legs or none , which fled before the man at my side and I wondered at the power he must hold . <newline> <newline> Days passed as we journeyed ever further away from my home , and into his . Always , in the morning there was a familiar breakfast , as if I had never left the academy . Eggs and toasted bread , with cheese and weak tea , hot and fresh gone by the time we set out -- plates , pans and all . Each evening , we supped on a stew , or fried fish and greens , or roast game of one sort or another . We drank aged wine , cold beer or some spiced , sweet , hot drink which was unfamiliar to me , but wonderful all the same . Always , the evidence of sustenance left with the stars -- though truly the canopy of the forest kept us in perpetual twilight . The sun shone weak through the leaves , and the leaves shone with their own light at night . Still , we said nothing at all and stepped on in silence . Until one day , while walking through a stony and rough place , we came to a cave in the side of a cliff and entered . Finally the green-eyed man spoke to me . <newline> <newline> “ This is my home ” he said . “ Come , you may stay awhile. ” <newline> <newline> He spoke roughly and quiet with a voice long used to silence . I heard the echo of great age and weariness in the gravel of his words . I gave my thanks , and hoped he would help me leave when the time came , for this place was far into Ystra ’ s garden and no friend of strangers . <newline> <newline> I found inside the cave a grand and comfortable sitting room , the far depths hidden by murk and subtly hinting at truly great depth . Leather sofa ’ s and throw-rugs , works of art and artifice from civilizations that I knew and many more I did not , lay haphazardly around the hall surrounded on every side by bookshelves , bookstacks , bookbaskets , scrolls and boards , claytablets and every manner of engraving , all lit by gentle hanging lanterns -- though hanging from what I could not see , for the ceiling could not be seen . It was warm and smelled of dust and paper . Here , my strange host left me , shrugging off his robe and stepping gently to a favoured seat in loose trousers and an off-white blouse to sit with eyes closed . Waiting , though I knew not for what then . <newline> <newline> It became clear to me then that I had something of a free run of his home while I was there and I spent my time exploring -- it was impossible to learn the layout of the place for there was none . I could walk in any direction I wished , and always I found simply stacks of writings and sofas . Every morning , breakfast was at hand , perched on whichever table was closest . Every evening , dinner sat the same , and always illuminated by the ubiquitous lanterns . So I read . Voraciously I read , and discovered that this place was a repository of literature . Literature from every author I knew , every unknown playwright and bard , every civilization still on this wild and suffering planet and every one which had died . I found records from glorious empires in languages I knew and languages completely foreign . Globe-spanning kingdoms and tiny hamlets left their folk-tales and Dramas there , sleeping side by side and waking to my touch ; Comedies and Histories and Grimoires and all , from every mind imaginable stacked in the dark or cradled in the light of lanterns . <newline> <newline> My rescuer wandered through periodically . Often carrying a new tome and organising by a method known only to him , walking with languid malaise or sitting in the background watching the shadows and saying never a word . The weight of our meeting pressed my mind , even as I wallowed in this world-wealth . I wondered at the power of this man , who wielded the arcane without focus , without spirit , without staff or symbol or scar or ink . Eventually , reading the great stories of great men and places , great tragedies and deaths , great kings and queens and the simple men who built their thrones and lived unsimple lives wasn ’ t enough to suppress my tongue and I approached him when he strode through the hall under the burden of a new tale . <newline> <newline> “ How ? ” I asked . “ How did you save me , when you can not be a mage ? ” <newline> <newline> And he glanced at me on his way and smiled . <newline> <newline> “ Not a mage indeed . Magi are the transparent glass image of wizardry . The Sorcerors of Mark , the warlocks covered in ink , the crystal men and hedge-wizards and contractors all are flimsy thieves borrowing the anger of creation ... ” He spoke with amusement and scorn of my teachers and kind , belittling the grand schools which supported our few besieged kingdoms against the always pushing wild . Yet I was not angry , for this place was a greater demonstration of power than any of the great halls and towers and libraries I ’ d had the joy to learn and live and love in . It seemed eternal , and I and they were not . <newline>

2,"The insurgent , dressed in Western clothes to blend in with everyone else , crossed the street to the car . The car was an old , red 1989 Honda Civic , and it blended in perfectly with all the other vehicles on the road . He got in and just sat there for a while , going over his mission one final time in his head , before finally starting the car and driving off . His name was Al-Shaadi , and although intel said he was in his early-twenties , he didn ’ t look to be very old , more of a teenager really . He was actually sort of handsome in a rugged sort of way , with light brown skin , dark brown hair practically shaved off in a buzzcut , and dark brown , almost black eyes . His nose looked a little crooked , probably from being broken in a fight or two with some of the other kids in the neighborhood . He was about five-foot eight , and weighed somewhere around 150 pounds , a lot of it being lean muscle . His family , unlike most of the other families that lived in this area of the city , was most likely wealthy for him to be in this good of shape . He also looked very well-fed , another reason to suspect that his family was very well off to say the least . He also didn ’ t really stand out , the perfect qualities for the jobs that he carried out around the city . <newline> <newline> <newline> The insurgent that I was following in a taxi has been on the C.I.A. ’ s most wanted list for almost a year now . He ’ s done everything from planting IEDs in heavy-traffic roads to publicly assassinating people in plain view on the streets . It took a lot of work to track him down . He went from city to city constantly , never staying in one place for more than a week at a time . One time , we almost lost him completely on a crowded street in Baghdad , but luckily a Predator drone in the area picked him up and we were able to follow him again . He was a vicious and smart son-of-a-bitch , but now , after months of trying to track him down , we finally traced him to the city of Karbala . And I was the one that got to take the shot on him . <newline> The equipment I used was hand-picked specially for this mission . My sniper rifle was the MK-11 mod 0 , with a 16-power scope and a built-in rangefinder ( The power refers to the zoom of the scope . For example , a 4-power scope magnifies the target by a factor of 4 , an 8-power magnifies by 8 , and so on ) , a suppressor , and a 20 round magazine . The MK-11 fired a 7.62 x 51mm NATO cartridge , capable of traveling at around 2,575 feet per second ( FPS ) . I preferred using a 7.62 compared to a 5.56 because the 7.62 packs a hell of a lot more punch , and tends to bring down the target in one shot rather than possibly having to use two or even three shots . My pistol was a HK45 with a 10 round clip and visible red laser , which fired the powerful .45 ACP round . However , if I had to resort to using my pistol in a firefight anyways , then the shit would ’ ve already hit that fan and I would ’ ve had to call for backup to get me out of there . I had a Marine-style KABAR , one of my favorites because of its sturdiness and how it stayed sharp no matter how many times you used it . My body armor was the Dragon Skin body armor , which was heavier than normal body armor , but a lot more effective at stopping bullets than the typical Navy body armor that the SEAL ’ s usually use . The taxi driver taking me to the destination was also a Marine , with a hidden M-16A4 below his seat , but he was only there in case things got hot . <newline> <newline> <newline> We followed Al-Shaadi until he stopped outside the American Embassy . I wondered why he was there . Was he trying to blow up the Embassy ? If that ’ s the case , then the soldiers inside would do my job for me . He had a briefcase with him , which could be the bomb . But right when it seemed he was going to go into the Embassy , he suddenly changed directions . Now he was walking down the street , completely calm and casual , like was taking a walk in the park . What was he doing ? I got out of the taxi and told the Marine to wait across the street . I climbed the ladder on the side of the building , and got to the roof . I followed Al-Shaadi from rooftop to rooftop , almost falling off one of the roofs in the process . God , where the hell was this guy heading ? <newline> Finally , after about 10 minutes of following this guy around , he went into an alley . I set up my sniper rifle on the wall of the roof to stabilize the gun , and waited . <newline> <newline> <newline> He was just standing there , like he was waiting for something . Or someone . <newline> After about half an hour of waiting , a man wearing a dishda ( a long , dress-like cloth that men usually wear in Iraq ) , also carrying a briefcase , walked into the alley . The two men shook hands , then got to work . As I watched them through my scope , Al-Shaadi opened the briefcase and showed the other man the contents . So I was right , there was a bomb there . But it wasn ’ t a typical IED that you would usually see these guys making . It looked much more complicated than that . What was it , and what was it meant for ? I called my CO and described what I saw , and told him about the other man . He told me to wait until they were about to leave , and then to kill them both . He wanted to know what the deal was about first . <newline> The two men talked and argued for about 15 minutes before they agreed on something . The two men exchanged briefcases , and shook hands again . I guess it was an arms deal of sorts , and the other briefcase had the money in it . But why could n't the other man just build a bomb himself ? Even if that bomb looked complicated and neat , it couldn ’ t be that hard to make if it was just an IED . There must be something else about that bomb that makes it worth so much . <newline> <newline> <newline> Whatever , I had my orders . <newline> I got Al-Shaadi in my sights , compensated for the slight wind and his movement , breathed out slowly , and fired . I aimed for his center mass , and the bullet hit him in the middle of his chest . He fell backwards and stayed there . I shot him another time to make sure he was dead , then I looked right away for the other man , but he had disappeared in the crowd with both the briefcases . Shit . <newline> <newline> <newline> I called it in to Command , and told them what happened . They asked me to describe the other man , and I told them everything I could see about him . His face , his estimated height and weight , everything that I observed about him . After that , I described the deal , and told them my thoughts about it . They didn ’ t say anything about it , but I could tell that they were thinking it through . They asked for my coordinates , then said that extraction was about ten minutes out . Then the line went dead . Who was this man ? And why was that bomb worth so much money ? <newline> <newline> <newline> I 'm on mobile and do n't know how to indent or do the spacing correctly , so I 'm sorry if it looks bad .

2,"Chapter 1 - <newline> <newline> Bang <newline> Bang <newline> Bang <newline> <newline> I gasped as I woke . I was lying alone on the floor of a strange room . It was dark… but my eyes seemed to have already adjusted to it . Strange… how could- <newline> <newline> Bang <newline> Bang <newline> Bang <newline> <newline> There was a muffled voice coming from the same place as the banging . There was a frustration in the voice , from what I could hear . Something about the voice made my stomach turn with hunger… <newline> <newline> Bang <newline> Bang <newline> Boom . <newline> <newline> “ Damn thing… ” <newline> <newline> Something gave way and the frustrated shout echoed off of the room ’ s metallic walls.. Was he holding me here ? Was he here to help me ? I tried to shift and get a better view of just what was going on but my body wasn ’ t responding . My whole world was a hazy blur… is that blood ... ? <newline> <newline> A stench rose in the air and my mind locked upon whatever it was… a beautiful stench of meat… I felt like I haven ’ t eaten in days ... damn it , why can ’ t I move ? <newline> <newline> A few steps echoed through the room with a metallic ring in them . As they grew closer , the smell grew much stronger . Oh God , just give it to me . I need something in my stomach , something in my mouth . Warmth , Meat , Flesh , Blood . Anything . Just give it to me ! The world started to spin . It was too much ... <newline> <newline> “ Here you go . Should have you up in no time… ” <newline> <newline> I slipped out from the world as if falling into a dream . Time lost all meaning and everything around me wavered in and out from reality , as if uncertain themselves whether or not they truly existed or were simply a fleeting memory . Sometimes I would awaken on the floor with that same horrible , wonderful stench in the air . My body quivering in anticipation . Other times I would be walking around the room as I woke , staring at rows upon rows of drawers set into the walls , tables scattered about or set into the wall . <newline> <newline> `` What 's your name ? '' <newline> <newline> All of it had the same sterile look of ungarnished metal , marred only by large blackened stains . Always the same smell… Blood… A horrid crimson blood like roses in twilight . The beautiful stench of life ’ s memory . Life that would soon be mine . A part of myself . The more I lingered on the smell , the shorter the fits of clarity seemed to be . <newline> <newline> `` Wake up , Mary . It 's breakfast time ! '' <newline> <newline> Soon enough I would be swimming again , lost in some non-reality until I was finally able to find a bit of reality to stand upon once more . Minutes , hours , days , weeks , months , years , decades , centuries . There was a seemingly endless amount of time in the middle where all I can remember wanting was to eventually find the end . This scent , this unreality , this horrible hunger ... Pain and hunger ... Food ... Meat ... <newline> <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> I woke lying on something hard . I was face down , looking over the edge of the whatever-it-was and down at the metal floor . There was a dark stain marring the otherwise uninteresting ground , bringing to mind the Rorschach tests where you would find shapes and scenes within blots of ink . This one was a sea urchin detonating , which no doubt would have led to extensive talks of how my childhood led to a favor of white wine over red , or other such nonsense . <newline> <newline> I tried to move . Tried to prop myself more upright and get into a position where I could observe just where I was , but my arms were stiff . I could practically hear the groan of old gears trying to move , as if each joint were a rusted machine , long forgotten in some lost factory.. I must have been lying here for quite some time to have gotten this stiff . I turned my head , neck similarly stiff but more obedient . It was time to try and get bearings of just where I was… <newline> <newline> The room was quite dark , making it rather difficult to see anything too specific . The wall to my left was lined with rows and rows of square doors . I had seen something similar before but I couldn ’ t quite remember from where… but they gave the impression of small refrigerators , neatly lined in a row . A few were slightly ajar , but none so much as to where I could see inside from this position . I seemed to be resting atop a large table of some sort , it just large enough for me to lie without hanging over the edges . A number of other similar tables were also in the room . A few had fallen onto their side to reveal wheels at the end of each leg . <newline> <newline> I started to push myself up , straining against my stubborn arms . There was a strange flowing in my body accompanied by my center of balance shifting . Were I not already lying it surely would have caused me to fall . There was something in me ... As I were filled near the brim with water , my body shifted and flowed with an internal liquid . Having successfully maneuvered myself to my knees , I crossed my stiff arms across my stomach and leaned forward to wretch . There was no pain or feeling of sickness , but my body had a desperate urge to dispel this foreign presence . My eyes clamped shut , I could feel the sludge crawl up my throat and out my mouth . There was no taste , just the feeling of my body gradually growing lighter as it was emptied . Eventually , the sickness was fully expelled from my system , now an oily brown puddle that was slowly creeping out to cover this area of the floor . <newline> <newline> I am not well . <newline> <newline> I looked around to try and get a better grasp of my surroundings now that I had a more natural position in the room . It was fairly empty for such a large room , larger than any sort of residence meaning that this place must have been specifically made for some purpose rather than a reclaimed building or one that had been repurposed . There was a long table in the back that had various small metal instruments strewn about it , though from this position I could n't tell the specifics on what they were . Apart from that , nothing else seemed to have been hiding behind me when I first awoke . <newline> <newline> Something was wrong… the whole scene… nothing dramatically wrong but.. as if looking at a painting that had been set into a new frame I could feel that there was something a bit off with how I was seeing the world . However , compared to the other problems at hand , this visual abnormality seemed trivial at best , so I tucked it away for later examination . Looking to the sides , I could see that the various tables were in fact gurneys , there wheels readily visible now that I could see . There was something strikingly familiar about them , but again my mind only offered absences when I tried to remember… I could not remember much at all really , so this was hardly surprising . This was no time to panic over lost memories , and visual abnormalities . I need to survive this place and get a grip on where I am before I start panicking over anything else . <newline> <newline> My vision wavered and my body started to grow unsteady . Now that I was recovering from the shock of vomiting , a deep tire made itself known throughout my body . Without any time to steady myself or shift , I felt myself falling towards the wall . The world faded into an odd yellow before darkness ; I didn ’ t even make it to the ground before passing out . Hopefully this strange dream will be over now ... <newline>

2,"** '' Are you serious ? This is just here ? `` ** The frigid air warmed perceptibly for a brief moment , and tongues of flame flashed in the pyromancer 's red-orange eyes . As far as expressions of surprise went , hers was winning in showmanship . At a different time , she would have thought it unfortunate that the showmanship ended there : the heavy , ragged , grey-white cloak she wore was the single most drab garment she ’ d could recall having had the displeasure of wearing . For the record , she ’ d have noted , it had been ragged when she got it ; `` It ’ s not *supposed* to be noteworthy '' , she ’ d been told . Regardless , she looked assuredly plain in the thing and , under ordinary circumstances , this would ’ ve been a problem for her . As it were , though , the circumstances were anything *but* ordinary , and she couldn ’ t have been less concerned with her appearance . `` This . '' She pointed a white-gloved finger down at the thing in the snow and turned her face to her escort , her golden hair swirling about her shoulders . `` This is just *out here* ? In the middle of nowhere ? '' <newline> <newline> He fixed his grey-eyed gaze on the fire mage . He looked bored ; this was mostly because he was bored at the moment , but also in part because he spent so much time being and looking bored that his face had begun to feel uncomfortable in other configurations . `` Yep '' , he responded , `` it ’ s 'just here ' . '' He 'd been through this show-and-tell routine enough times : the new kids were always surprised . He 'd grown as accustomed to their shock as he ’ d grown to the all-too-familiar weight of his own heavy , not-quite-white cloak . If he could ’ ve thought of a response more indifferent than `` yep '' , he ’ d have said that , instead . <newline> <newline> Despite his reassurance , she still had n't fully wrapped her mind around what was going on . The bits of her mind that still were n't occupied with the magnitude of what she was looking at took over her mouth , and repeated the question . `` It 's just ... here ? In ... '' She gestured around at the frozen earth . `` In *this* ? '' <newline> <newline> They ’ d already been over this , hadn ’ t they ? `` Yes . It is 'just here ' . Yes , it is in the middle of a frozen hell . Yes , you are really looking at it . No , this is not a dream nor , if you fancy , a nightmare . '' He tapped a booted foot impatiently , but the sound was lost in the snow . <newline> <newline> The fire mage 's words were still airy . `` How… how can we just *have* ... something ... like this ? '' <newline> <newline> He sighed , and ran a hand through his greying hair before answering . `` We need it . '' The sigh hadn ’ t been at the necessity of `` it '' , but had been in exasperation : he hated stupid questions . Why , he wondered , why would she have even bothered to ask a question with such a plain answer ? Of course they needed it ; if they did n't need it , they would n't have it . This was n't the sort of business people got into on a whim . <newline> <newline> She knelt , her hand reaching cautiously toward the smooth , gleaming metal surface of what she still had n't fully decided whether or not she accepted . She wanted badly to touch it but , at the same time , she could n't fathom that it might be okay to put her hands on such a thing . She mouthed a silent `` wow '' , then turned back to her escort . `` She 's ... beautiful . '' The pyromancer 's eyes were glowing , in a very literal sense . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll tell the engineers that you think so . '' He had absolutely no intention of doing so . `` Now , if you ’ re all done looking at it– '' <newline> <newline> The look on her face made it quite evident that she most certainly was not all done looking at it . <newline> <newline> The look on *his* face , however , said that he , with equal certainty , did n't care whether or not she were , in fact , all done . `` –I ’ ve got some other things that need doing . '' He turned , and began walking back the way they 'd come . He didn ’ t wait for her ; it would be on her to catch up , because the problems she ’ d have if she didn ’ t manage to do so would be on her to deal with . The possibility of getting lost and freezing to death – or knowing exactly where one was and freezing to death , regardless – was a real concern , even to a fire mage . As far as concerns went , though , that wasn ’ t the most pressing . There were fates worse than freezing to death . Even to a fire mage . <newline> <newline> As she caught up , she set her eyes on third individual , coming toward them from the direction they were headed . His hood was drawn up over his head , but still somewhat failing to manage the long , silver hair that seemed somewhat insistent on escaping . He was young , much younger than her escort , and quite possibly younger than herself . She didn ’ t recall seeing him when she 'd arrived but , she contemplated , it would n't have been hard to miss him , between the constant snowfall and the fact that he wore the same dingy , almost-white cloak that adorned her and her escort . She briefly wondered how many others they might have passed without her notice , but the stranger drew her attention from the question when he addressed her escort : `` Hey , old man . All done giving the grand tour ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , I ’ m done for the day . Go ahead and cover the thing up , unless they plan on using it , tonight . '' <newline> <newline> `` If anyone plans on using the circle , they haven ’ t told me about it . I 'll let them dig it up , themselves , if they need the thing . '' He seemed amused with the thought . `` Take it easy , old man . See you tomorrow . Tell the wife thanks , for me . '' *Speaking of the wife* , the hooded man thought , in a very pointed fashion , *does the missus know you ’ re out here all alone with the fire girl ? Blondie ’ s awfully nice to look at ; I don ’ t think your old lady would be happy about it . If you want to trade jobs for a while ... * <newline> <newline> The older man interrupted his thoughts . `` Whatever , kid . Try not to have too much fun out here all night , doing *your* job , which you know damn well I wouldn ’ t do , even if I could . I 've *no interest* ; I ’ m too old for all this ... ice . '' He raised his hand in farewell as he walked past the other man . As he made to return it to his side , one finger might have lingered airborne a bit longer than the others . <newline> <newline> The hooded stranger laughed , his blue eyes sparkling and his lips pulling back into a familiar smile . `` Sure , sure . We all know how much you love *your* job , for reasons that are completely beyond me . I didn ’ t really want to trade , anyway . '' He rolled his eyes , theatrically . `` Do n't blame it on the ice , though . There are plenty of ways to stay warm out here , and you know it . '' A gentle breeze wafted the fire mage ’ s hair , despite the fact that the wind had been otherwise entirely absent since the stranger arrived . She didn ’ t take notice , but her escort half-scowled at the younger man ; the other half of his expression remained dedicated to conveying how very unimpressed with the situation he was . The silver-haired man broadened his grin , and thought at the fire mage ’ s escort , again : *How about* you *try not to have too much fun tonight , you old dog ? * <newline> <newline> `` Blow me , kid . '' He reconsidered his word choice as a freezing gust embraced him , frosting his beard and sending puffs of snow into panicked swirls , ruffling his cloak about his feet . It was n't entirely unexpected , but his scowl still intensified at the chill . He turned to the pyro . `` You 're going to want to put your hood up . '' He was already doing so , himself . <newline> <newline> On cue , the winds began to pick up , quickly forsaking their previous nature as a gentle zephyr and instead finding stride in a lively , swirling dance . <newline> <newline> The pyromancer glanced back over her shoulder , then , upon seeing what was happening , turned to walk backward , that she might watch the wind-driven snow and ice slowly , steadily consume the intricate metalwork that sprawled across the ground . The stranger they ’ d passed stood there , in the swirling winds , the bottom of his cloak resting calmly about his feet , undisturbed . He 'd lowered his hood , and his long , silver hair fell straight down about his back and shoulders , apparently oblivious to the air 's movement . <newline> <newline> When the winds ebbed and died , there was nothing to distinguish this bit of tundra from any other , save for the single wind mage standing there , nigh-invisible in a cloak that matched the tundra far too well to be explained by coincidence . The gleam of metal was nowhere to be seen , footprints had been swallowed . Indeed , to her untrained eye , there was no trace of any activity . She simply didn ’ t know what to look for . <newline> <newline> An exceptionally prudent watcher , though , might have noticed the cadre of wind mages and ice mages , almost imperceptible in their arctic cloaks , that rotated in and out of the area , maintaining a permanent , wakeful garrison . An even more-prudent watcher might have noticed that , regardless of how the wind shifted the rest of the tundra , constantly rearranging the mounds of snow and ice as winds were wont to do , the snow did not shift in that one spot , because the wind in that particular place did not blow at anything above a faint breeze unless it was specifically willed to . When the winds did blow , there , they never manifested in the terrible , driving winds that howled about the rest of the tundra , ripping up the snow and ice and tossing them carelessly wherever they might land . It was important that the wind was never strong : a small expenditure of magic for a gentle breeze was much less noticeable than a mage conjuring a gale , in the event that someone were looking for such things . <newline> <newline> But , alas , there was no prudent watcher looking for such things , because the most important safety measure was also the simplest : there were many places a prudent watcher might set eyes on , but who would imagine there might be anything worth watching for in middle of that cold , dead world of ice ?

2,"PREFACE : This was a book that I began writing a few years ago but forgot about . I wrote this chapter when i was about 13 . GAZE UPON ITS UNEDITED GLORY <newline> <newline> Chapter 0- prologue <newline> <newline> Markus Brigham was sleeping soundly on his gel-bed in Mars Outpost Alpha ’ s Dormitory section . Dreams of home , Earth , his parents , filled his mind . His twisting and turning was interrupted by the sirens wailing across the compound , accompanied by a robotic voice blaring through the speakers ; “ Every recruit to the Main Compound : Permission to use the vacuum tubes is granted , this is a maximum level threat ! The compound is under attack ! Repeat : Every recruit to… ” <newline> <newline> Markus woke with a start and a small worry at the back of his head : they had allowed vacuum tube transport . When it ’ s a drill , they don ’ t allow the extra-expensive , extra- efficient transport system to be used by recruits . But then again , the announcement had not said that it wasn ’ t a drill . All the same , he hopped out of bed with a start , changing into his uniform without falter , the whole process taking less than thirty seconds . He quickly brought his wrist-communicator up to his mouth , and set the channel to ‘ Team-Talk ’ . <newline> <newline> “ Warriors Six , this is Io Rutter , team leader , report in ! ” A voice , tired yet stern and crystal clear emerged from the watch-like device . <newline> <newline> “ Drake Vaskez , reporting in . <newline> <newline> Danny Scannel , reporting in . <newline> <newline> Lucy Ruskin , reporting in . <newline> <newline> Mike Laino , reporting in. ” <newline> <newline> “ Markus Brigham , reporting in. ” <newline> <newline> “ Okay team , converge on weapons locker No.296 . Over ” <newline> Markus stepped out of his small sleeping space to be greeted by different recruits trying to organise themselves . Markus smiled slightly at other teams ’ disorganisation , all of them rushing out of the rooms without having communicated with other team-mates , obviously attempting to sacrifice organisation for speed . Such a trade could not work out in such cramped conditions . <newline> <newline> Once he had made it out of the fray , he ran down the corridor and turned left , shoes skidding on the floor causing him to crash into the wall , but he had no time to admire the sun rising on the horizon of the red planet through the several layers of pristine safety-glass . He had to meet up with his squad , and he had quickly regained momentum as he sped down the empty corridor , stopping only once he had reached the door that was marked with big , red letters : WEAPON LOCKERS . Markus hated this next part , as he always had . Holding open his eyelids , he moved his face close to the retina scan and stared into the red light that soon turned green along with the robotic , monotone voice , ” Markus Brigham , assigned to the squad ‘ Warriors Six ’ . Access granted. ” <newline> <newline> “ Ah , here ’ s Markus , ” a familiar voice said . That particular voice belonged to Drake Vaskez , the strategist . He was tall , well-built , and a good fighter . <newline> <newline> “ About time , soldier , ” Io said sarcastically . She was 16 years old ( as were the rest of Warriors Six ) , slim and beautiful . Io was the only Mars-born recruit in the entire compound , and she was team ’ s hacker . Any computer , she could get inside within a minute . She also happened to be Markus ’ girlfriend . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , sorry about that . Other recruits were all over the corridor , it was chaos . Weapon ? ” Mike whispered something to Danny and he could hardly contain his laughter . Mike and Danny were like two peas in a pod , one a prankster , and one an incredible inventor , they caused chaos and laughter all over the compound , and utterly chaotic traps for the enemy on the battleground . <newline> <newline> “ Here , ” Lucy said , handing over a plasma pistol and a plasma rifle . She was the team scout , being fast , agile , and having a good memory . Her skill was unmatched on mars , in a room with three other people in , she could swap the contents of their pockets and they wouldn ’ t even realize . <newline> <newline> Markus himself was the team ’ s rouge . He ran distractions and illusions , delaying and sabotaging the enemy while the rest of his team planned . “ Thanks , ” he replied , holstering his rifle on his back and his pistol in his leg-holster . “ Where ’ s the nearest Vacuum Tube ? ” Drake pulled up his holo-map and zoomed in on the weapon lockers on their floor . A red dot appeared on the map , followed by three more . Red dots represented unknown life-forms or enemy troops . There were green dots representing recruits , many of them were still just outside the dorms . As the red dots rounded the corner , the green dots slowly went out , one by one . Once all the green dots had vanished , the four enemies started approaching the weapon lockers . <newline> <newline> Everyone looked up in dread . Drake turned towards Mike and Danny , <newline> <newline> “ Set up a trap . Delay them as much as you can , or if need be , arrange a fatal situation . But we still need one left alive , to interrogate . Io , hack the doors , block the path from the dorms to here , to give Danny and Mike more time . Lucy , Markus , with me. ” Markus followed to the other side of the room , near the heavy weapons . <newline> <newline> “ Okay , Lucy , run to the nearest vacuum tube and get as many recruits as you can . Go. ” Lucy opened the door and ran off , towards the other dorm section . <newline> “ Markus , you and I will have to face the enemy head on . Other than me , you ’ re our squad ’ s best fighter . Here , I found these. ” Drake held out some red-pulsing beam weapons , experimental reverse-engineered alien tech that was off-limits to recruits on normal situations . However , this was not a normal situation . <newline> <newline> “ Are you sure ? I mean , this is alien technology , I ’ m not even sure how it- “ Markus was interrupted by Io , <newline> <newline> “ Uh , guys ? They ’ re here ! ” Drake pulled up his map and there they were , four red dots , just outside the weapon lockers . <newline> <newline> There was a bang at the door , Danny and Io backed away but Mike wasn ’ t quite fast enough . The door exploded inwards , metal scraps flying everywhere and Mike ’ s figure was consumed by the bulk of the door , a large metal slab . It crushed him , but there was no time to check if he was okay , as the smoke cleared to reveal four enemies , all rebels by the look of their uniforms . <newline> <newline> Danny was clearly close to tears , as Mike was as close to a brother to him as you could be without being actually related . With a cry of pure anger , he lifted his rifle towards the rebels and fired rapidly , downing one of them before another one lifted their pistol and fired . The shot hit him square in the chest , and continued to the wall behind him . He fell to the floor , a look of shock permanently etched into his face , and a gaping hole where his heart used to be . <newline> Markus and Drake lifted their Beam Rifles , and pulled the triggers simultaneously . Markus ’ weapon fired perfectly , hitting a rebel in the face before he even managed to lift his weapon . Drake ’ s gun , however , backfired with a bright pulse of red light and he never even had time to cry out before his upper torso was a smoking lump of burning flesh , and fell to the floor , dead . <newline> <newline> Lucy came running back through the other door , talking so fast that Markus could barely keep up . “ The rebels have killed everyone , I think we ’ re the only one ’ s le- “ She was interrupted by a rebel sneaking up behind her , grabbing her by the jaw , twisting sharply . A grim CRACK marked the death of yet another Warriors Six member . Io ran towards Markus , eyes watering up . <newline> <newline> “ We ’ re the only one left . I guess this is it. ” The rebels closed in and lifted their weapons . Markus never thought that he ’ d go out this way . Maybe on a rebel-controlled planet , fighting for the federation . But not like this , cowering in fear . <newline> “ No. ” Markus didn ’ t even recognise the voice until it occurred to him that it was his voice . Then , he realised what he was doing . He said again , “ No , no , no ! ” He didn ’ t even notice when Io was killed ruthlessly , he was just shouting incoherent things , shaking on the floor . The rebels were unsure of what to do , looking to each other with uncertainty . Then , without any indication , Markus grabbed his pistol and shot with deadly accuracy . One in the head , one in the chest , another two in the head . After less than a minute , all the rebels were dead . They fell for the old ‘ play insane ’ trick . <newline> <newline> “ SIMULATION COMPLETE , ” a seemingly omnipresent robotic voice sounded , “ Survivors : Markus Brigham . Top marks awarded. ” <newline> Markus blinked and when he opened his eyes , he was in his bed again . Then , it dawned on him . He had heard rumours of these types of simulations . While you ’ re sleeping , the computer contacts the chip in your brain and causes a campus-wide mass dream-simulation . It all felt so real , and he wasn ’ t expecting it . Then again , that ’ s why they do these tests . <newline> <newline> He jumped out of bed and put on his uniform again , ( he felt a strange sense of déjà-vu ) and activated the computer-pad on the wall , checking the leader boards for the recruits . Once again , he was in first place for simulation-tests . He smiled to himself , as these simulations were the only things that he was good at . <newline> Later , he was in the mess hall , sat with the rest of his squad . The meal today was , as every other day , some kind of porridge-like slop that was packed with all the nutrients that the cadets needed for the day . <newline> <newline> “ It always feels so weird when you die in the simulation , ” Io said , a small cringe on her face , ” It ’ s just so … I dunno , hard to describe. ” The others nodded in agreement , mouths full of the thick goo that was their breakfasts . <newline> <newline> “ I wouldn ’ t know , ” said Markus , casually . Everyone on his table turned to look at him . “ Well , it ’ s not that bad if you don ’ t get killed . Just saying. ” <newline> <newline>

2,"I wrote this three years ago , I 've progressed in my writing since then , but the idea is still in my heart . <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> The air fills us , permeates every orifice , sewing life and death in each of us . Rusting blood , <newline> <newline> filling lung . <newline> <newline> Oh greatest god , dirtiest devil , life of my body , reaper of my soul , you have been tamed . Made to quiver , obey . <newline> <newline> Oh greatest servant , grimly and carefully obeying . You have no shame , bearing the weight of our progress , the guilt of our sin . <newline> <newline> The world hums with fear . I stand at the brink of eternal , all has come , all will come , all is . I have seen you , I have become you . We who are forever , will become fleeting . We who are all , torn to be one . <newline> <newline> I have seen you , now come greatest god , now greatest servant , come . You are the air in my lungs , and you are mine . <newline> <newline> -Passages from the death of Rictivus , Tamer of the Wind . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The clouds were an ocean of grey , masking the earth below . Thunder chases lightning down shafts of light and fire , tearing the land , burning the air . The small Skyship floating in the storm veered port-side , per the shout of a ragged man hunched over a compass and a map . His beard incomplete , scored with scars and burns . His eyes dark , sharply scanning the well kept map and compass . Both surfaces well oiled and cleaned , contrasting sharply with the mans unkempt visage . He shifts on his sturdy , weathered bare feet , grumbling something through his teeth about , `` blasted trade winds . '' <newline> <newline> `` Daelin ! Gods damnit boy take the helm . 'M tired of these god damned winds turning me 'round . See us in Cairnsport by morning or you 're on dishes for a week ! '' <newline> <newline> A bright eyed youth , presumably Daelin , sprouted from a hatch not far from the man , eagerly scrambling up the remains of a rusted iron ladder . The boy sidled next the the man , pushing frail arms out of too big sleeves . One hand grasping at the map and compass , the other fumbling for a pencil . <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir ! I 'll see us there before dusk Captain ! '' The boy sputtered out over ragged breaths . He began intently studying the compass and map , drawing faint lines , doing rapid calculations , and re-drawing lines . <newline> The boy was sharp , had an eye for numbers . Had his uses he did . Loyal too ; Always willing to do what needed doing . Tiny boy though , no good in a raid no good at all . <newline> <newline> The slapping of skin on wood soaked in to every panel of the walls as the captain trudged down to the bow of the ship . His footfalls heavy , no care given to the weight of his movement . His focus was dispersed , filing its way through each memory . Through every thin strand of life clinging tenuously to the next . Diving in to those of value , bringing their contents to the front of his attention . Then sifting through , caressing every moment ; just as the hand tracing the grain of the walls of the ship . Then his grasp on what was fled him as suddenly as the momentum of his body . He was stopped in front of a woman , tall and dark . A grimace holding her face . <newline> <newline> `` Captain . '' A nearly immobile set of lips pushed out , never breaking the grimace . `` Where are you going ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It seemed nowhere , now I suppose it was to find you . '' His jovial tone indicated familiarity , but no comfort entered his eyes . In its stead only wariness . `` Come , we 've need to speak . '' He pushed past her , eyes glazing once again searching for the tendrils of his life . He found only a dull ache and a deep sigh . <newline> <newline> A low tremble from behind caused him to stop . He knew it , and every inch of him begged to run . He knew better by now , though . That was the fear of a warrior and of a boy . A moment more and it ceased , prompting him to turn to the woman with an eyebrow raised . <newline> <newline> `` It is done . '' The words came between gasps , the dark woman no longer held composure . Incredulity crossed through her grimace , nipped at the heels by bliss . <newline> <newline> Once again came the tremble . This time not of the lips of the woman , but now of the air around him . He could feel the pressure in the cabin change . The air being pulled from his lungs , being woven around the woman . He desperately fought panic as his lungs emptied . He could feel his body slowly dying , yet he remained staring at her impassively . Her eye lids flickered , eyes rolled back in pleasure . <newline> `` It is done ? '' he asked as soon as the air returned to him . Inquisitively tilting his head towards her . <newline> <newline> `` Aye , it is done . No longer inhibited is my blood . No longer staunched is the flow . I once more see the gods among us , the flows of air pressing on everything . Once more I speak with her . Once more we are one . '' <newline> <newline> The smile on her face was unabashed as she spoke the words . Feeling no desire to hide how wonderfully changed the world was . She almost seemed lighter , so full of the wind that it lifted her being to join it in the endless dance across the world . <newline> <newline> `` I suppose this is n't the time , Evaria ; But I 've got a boy in the cabin fighting against some of the worst damned weather I 've seen this lifetime . I do n't suppose you 'd lend the lad a hand , had you one to spare ? '' The captain raised a brow as he spoke , very clearly implying it was more than an inquiry . Though he knew one did n't command a Windspeaker , you could come close . <newline> <newline> `` Ah-I . Of course Captain , I 'll see us safely there . Speak with me at port . There is more . '' With this she dipped her head , indicating respect and familiarity , and she fled towards the deck . Once more the Captain reached for his sanity , to reclaim his past and command it . He wandered down the halls ; Unconsciously trudging towards the engine room . His grimace broke before the hatch leading to the engineering bay . Tears swept down his face , and his legs failed him . A silence then engulfed the halls . The first , a pleasant silence , of great weights lifted . The second silence held itself only in the quivering eyes of the Captain , a silence of a man who knew the price of progress . One created only out of a break so jagged between joy and sorrow . The captain knelt where his grief had left him . <newline> <newline> `` Aiyla , I beg you forgive me . Were there any other way ... '' <newline> <newline> There he collapsed . <newline> <newline> Daelin was proud of himself . This was something he was good at . Taking information , making judgments based on various factors , and making decisions based on those judgments . He was comfortable giving orders , though he was never a commanding presence . He hunched over the navigational equipment , glancing between maps and compass . Barking orders to be relayed to the deck workers . A clanging broke his concentration , and Evaria soon peaked out of the hatch leading in to the command cabin . <newline> <newline> `` Daelin , I can work once more ; Where do you need me ? '' Daelin clapped his hands and straightened out . <newline> <newline> `` Evaria ! That 's amazing ! I need you on deck , we have incredible winds port-side , we 're doing everything we can to counter it and keep a straight course . We 're not winning the battle though . If you 're feeling up to it , I 'd have you there dampening the blows. `` <newline> <newline> `` Daelin , the softening of the winds is the work of children . What would you have of me ? '' <newline> <newline> Daelin grinned . `` Can you break this storm ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Aye , that is something worthy of a Windspeaker . '' <newline> <newline> Evaria gazed out the port window , watching the dark of the tempest that had risen to swallow them . It was blown asunder often by sharp white lightning . The heat of it , the life of it , the incredible power filled Evaria . She could feel the dance of storm course through her . She turned , and strode down the bridge reaching a sturdy iron door leading in to the storm . With a breath , she unhinged the lock and stepped outside . The cold wind struck her first , nearly pulling her from her feet . Had she not been years a sailor it might have . Then the cold tore at her . Pulling each strand of warmth from each inch of exposed skin . She smiled and shivered ; one part in chill of the night , one thousand parts exhilaration . She began to step across the walkway that linked the main body of the ship with the bridge , at the fore . Men and women beyond that bridge rushed for rope , chasing desperately to bring anything under control , yet unable to against the might of the hurricane . She made her way past them , and up an iron ladder , to the upper deck of the ship . a cacophony of fear and order hung too heavy for the winds to cleanse here . desperate men tying ropes , leading sails , managing propellers . Once again , she grinned . It was incredible to her how easily the world took men by their hearts . Men without power but their own arms shook at the sigh of air . She cackled in to the night at the thought . <newline> <newline> `` Emboldened gods so full of breath , quiet the winds and fear my step . '' She had begun weaving . She was crouched low , her legs wide and sturdy . She shifted feet , turning about with the fluid movements of her <newline> hands . <newline> <newline> `` Hold the sky , break the clouds , let your wrath quell no hounds . '' <newline> <newline> Her movement continued , more sure now . She could feel it , the air all around her , its pressure and weight . She let her being disperse around her , feel the air for miles . <newline> She began to whisper . <newline> <newline> `` Feel me , god of death . I am here , and you will bow . '' <newline>

2,"CHAPTER ONE <newline> <newline> <newline> Charlotte Winslow had been alone for an incredibly long time . Unable to trust anyone to watch her back , she was sequestered to a lone wolf lifestyle . After all , in a zombie apocalypse , everyone wants to live , and if anything gets in the way of that , they turn hostile . Fourteen months ago , Charlotte was scavenging for anything she could get her hands on when she stumbled upon a minimall , and went inside hoping for some food or water to keep her alive . She then literally stumbled upon a group of survivors that had holed up inside , and they assumed she was dangerous . They assumed that letting her have any food would make less for them in the long run , so they came after her . She fought back as hard as she knew how to , and twenty minutes later she was pushing two shopping carts filled with enough guns , ammo , and food to supply an army base for a month back to the broken down four seater she called a home . <newline> <newline> She had been following a new group for a while . After her last incident , she learned that she couldn ’ t join a group because they couldn ’ t be trusted . Instead , she followed them . She watched them . If she knew where they were and what they were up to , she was invincible . Posted up in an old , rotting , beaten down and half rebuilt motel , she brought her rifle to her face . She had fashioned a makeshift scope from a broken pair of binoculars , and she used it to keep tabs on her current mark . Observing the crew over the past week or so , she had begun to understand their dynamic . <newline> <newline> The oldest looking one was a tall , muscular man with a salt and pepper beard and dark , walnut skin . He was visibly the strongest , though he collaborated with a scrawny looking guy to make decisions . The scrawny guy had a pair of bent glasses balanced precariously on the bridge of his nose , one lens barely held into place with tape , and the other cracked to the point where Charlotte was surprised he could see out of it . <newline> <newline> The third and final guy in the group was a decently sized man about her age who liked to smile a lot . She almost hated him , because he always seemed to look happy , especially when he was looking at the small tattooed woman . Standing at about five foot nothing , she could have passed for any age between twelve and twenty four . She carried herself extremely heavily , as if she was constantly being dragged down by some sort of invisible weight . She had a shock of blue hair on her otherwise blonde head , and had four visible tattoos . Two symbols on her left arm , a pair of fangs on her right , and a spread of wings that occupied her entire back . However , she wasn ’ t currently present in the lineup she had in her sights . <newline> <newline> The final member of the group was a young , but weary girl that looked to be a bit older than Charlotte . She was covering one arm with the other as if she was cold , but there was no discernible chill in the air . Charlotte tried to focus on her to see what she was doing , but before she could , a streak of brown collided with her face and she dropped her gun . Tears welling up in her eyes from the sharp pain , she staggered to her feet and pulled a pistol out of her bag . <newline> <newline> “ Don ’ t you dare move. ” the tattooed girl spat , scooping up Charlotte ’ s rifle and pointing it back at her . <newline> <newline> “ Easy now , ” she pleaded , putting the gun on the ground and slowly reaching behind her back . “ I don ’ t want any trouble . It ’ s not every day peop- ” <newline> <newline> “ Stop ! You think I didn ’ t see your little knife back there ! ” she threatened , her hands shaking slightly from the weight of the rifle . “ I know you have a sheath strapped to your back , so how about you save us both the trouble and drop your backpack. ” <newline> <newline> As Charlotte slid the strap from her shoulder and put it on the ground , she noticed the girl holding her up at gunpoint had a faint accent , but she couldn ’ t place it . The happy guy , now holding a machete , traded places with her tattooed terrorist , so now he was in front of Charlotte . His steely demeanor faltered once he looked at her , and he almost dropped his weapon in surprise . <newline> <newline> “ Chuck ? ” he breathed , almost silently , running his dusty hand through his hair as he blinked in disbelief . “ Is that you ? ” Charlotte paused , but as soon as she saw his goofy smile and remembered all of the nicknames he had for her , she knew who he was . <newline> <newline> “ Ted ? Teddy Buck ? From elementary school ? ” she exclaimed in disbelief , dropping her guard for a moment before a stern and accented voice filled the night air . <newline> <newline> “ You know this girl Teddy ? ” the tattooed girl asked , still holding onto Charlotte ’ s rifle , but using the shoulder strap to keep it held up . charlotte got a good look at the detail of her tattoos , and realized she must be older than she thought , because they were already slightly faded . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , Annie , this is Charlotte ! I knew her way back when , before everything ended. ” he explained . He turned back to face her with an ear-to-ear grin on his face . “ How have you been ? ” <newline> <newline> Charlotte raised an eyebrow . “ Oh , I ’ ve been great . My whole family is dead , along with everyone else I ’ ve ever known. ” she deadpanned , rubbing the side of her aching head where Annie ’ s hiking boot had struck . <newline> <newline> “ Not everyone , Chuckles . Who knew you ’ d grow up to be a pessimist ? At least you ’ re finally reunited with your good friend Teddy ! ” he joked , still plastering that ridiculous smile all over his face . He lunged towards her , and before she could reach for her knife , he wrapped her in a hug . <newline> <newline> “ Ted , we only have like six hours until daylight . Can we cut the reunion a bit short ? ” the guy with glasses said , his tired voice barely groaning out of his mouth . “ I ’ m tired , man. ” <newline> <newline> Ted held on for a moment longer and stepped back . “ That ’ s one thing they never talk about when they mention a zombie apocalypse . No more hugs. ” he said , furrowing his brow . <newline> <newline> “ Ted , that might be the first time I ’ ve ever seen you unhappy. ” the older man laughed , putting his hand on Ted ’ s shoulders as he stepped forward . <newline> <newline> “ Quit laughing , Stewart , hugs are serious business. ” Ted smiled , to the restrained snickering of his group . Charlotte was stunned by what was playing out before her , but was snapped back to reality by the other woman ’ s voice . <newline> <newline> “ Any empty rooms available ? ” she asked . Her eyes looked more sunken in up close , and it gave her a tired , gaunt quality . Her flowing black hair cascaded against her backpack , which was barely being held on by the strained straps affixed to her slumped shoulders . “ We haven ’ t been able to find a place with beds in a long time. ” Her arms were still folded in front of her , but Charlotte could suddenly feel the chill of the nighttime wind . <newline> <newline> Charlotte took an uneasy breath . She thought back to the last group of survivors that had gotten close enough to see her , and how they were either stinking up a minimall or filling the stomachs of a hundred different zombies . She needed time to think . “ So you ’ re Teddy Buck , all grown up ? ” she began , taking a step back and brushing the hair out of her face . “ In the span of , what , fifteen or so years you graduated high school , moved back to Reno , lost everyone and everything you ’ ve ever loved , and now you have a solid group to call home ? ” she asked . She looked over to her right and saw that from the second floor banister , it was only a ten or eleven foot drop to the parking lot . <newline> <newline> “ Yep. ” he replied simply . <newline> <newline> “ Just yep ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes ? ” <newline> <newline> “ People can change in fifteen years , Ted. ” she shot back , slipping the back of her foot out of her shoe . “ How do I know this isn ’ t an act to trick me into trusting you ? ” <newline> <newline> Ted paused . “ Because I stopped Annie from shooting you , Chuck. ” <newline> <newline> Charlotte looked at Ted . There was a bead of sweat slowly moving down Ted ’ s forehead , slowly inching towards his eye . She took a deep breath , and as he blinked to get the sweat out of his eye , she flung her loose shoe at him . While he was disoriented , she kicked her backpack off of the balcony and jumped after it , crumpling into a roll as she hit the ground . She snatched up her bag and sprinted away , listening for gunshots in the commotion she caused . Once she was out of eyeshot , she grabbed the other half of her binoculars and carefully looked at the group that had just confronted her . She was expecting them to be riled up about the fact that they had lost her , but instead they were simply shuffling into one of the many vacant rooms and closed the door behind them . Charlotte sighed , her heart pounding from the recent rush of adrenaline . She looked down at herself to make sure she wasn ’ t hurt , and saw that she had stepped on a broken piece of glass with her shoeless foot . She winced and pulled it out , popped open her meager first aid kit , and bandaged it up . She cursed herself for not being more careful , and decided she would find new shoes once the group left the motel . Sitting in the burned shell of the car she was hiding behind , she tried to make herself comfortable . She reached into her bag and pulled out her spare pistol . Cocking it and gripping it tightly , she dozed off into a fitful , restless , painful sleep .

2,"Footsteps trudging in the snow was common to me . At a young age I had already associated it with everyday life , that combined with long drawn out darkness and bitter cold . The living conditions of the north are not reputable for their hospitality . The long cold winters discourage attempts at life flourishing , blanketing the landscape with a thick permanent layer of cold . Yet somehow the northern tribes survived and adapted . Where as some would fall to the grip of winter or be dissuaded entirely , the northern tribes grew and took control of the climate . Generations became accustomed to the relentless winds and the desolate lands devoid of wildlife , they grew physically and mentally hardy . As though they had in some way become as resilient as the weather itself . <newline> It was as such that the northern tribes where immensely difficult to negotiate with , fight with or in any way communicate with . Many envoys from warmer and less hostile environments would be met with stony glares from hardened warriors . In the rare cases where some foolhardy king or leader took it upon themselves to assault the northern tribes , they quickly found themselves unsuited for the climate . Those that survived long enough to do battle learned swiftly as to what kind of people chose to live in such a place . It was perhaps a small mercy that the northern tribes had no interest in anything beyond their borders . Their driving force for hundreds of years had been not expansion or conquest , they did not seek religious or philosophical enlightenment . The one thought that unionised the hearts of all the nordic tribesman , whether warrior or worker , was survival . <newline> In the early second century , the modern civilised world was attacked by some malevolent force . They did n't stand a chance . The great white cities of the south , of which great stories and songs where written about , fell to the evil in a blaze . News eventually came north of how the skies where black and thick with the smoke of war and how the great white cities fell , how the people ran and how they where cut down without reason . Some of the great warriors laughed solemnly , nodding their heads that this was long in the making . Others barely noticed at all . Months passed on and the news continued to flood in , more and more of the civilised world was being laid to waste by the black army . The sprawling merchant cities laid out on the coast suffered the same fate , the entrenched fortresses deep in the southern swamps where now naught but ruin . Again the same story , the smoke of war ever present and thick . Still the northern people paid little heed . I was young at the time and the troubles outside the village meant nothing to me . <newline> More time passed , more the war raged on . An envoy sent from the Golden Kingdoms announced himself with an official order , a call to arms . Every notable civilisation was issued the same command that they ally with the modern world and aid the conquest . Our warlord could barely contain his laughter was the envoy was marched out of the city at spearpoint . We would never stoop so low as to lay down our lives to the southern people . Nevertheless the atmosphere changed that night . Even the hardened warriors looked slightly more grave with ever passing day . While the call to arms had been burnt in the town fire to a crowd of jeering northern folk , it did in some way serve its purpose . The war was no longer news and rumor but very much real and encroaching on our threshold . More envoys came , and as time pressed on it was clear the Golden Kingdoms where becoming more desperate . Envoys began arriving more frequently and with gifts . Gold and trinkets at first , and then promises of titles and land . They where all met with the same steely glances and glares . They did not understand our way of life , that shiny objects have no value . They can not be eaten , nor can they be used to fight . They do not burn or keep out the winter . Titles where equally meaningless , perhaps more so . Land ? Everything we required was within our boundaries . Yet as quickly as they where mocked and dismissed they returned with fresh gifts and propositions . Eventually at some point , the envoys stopped turning up . Two weeks later an armed unit infiltrated our encampment during the night . <newline> At this point in time I was officially recognised as a man , although technically I was still in adolescence . I was no mere child of the white cities however , lazy and plump and cultivated for science . I was a northern tribesman , wrought from generations . I apprenticed for our blacksmith . We did not believe in the hulking metal shells of the southern folk , they did not suit our environment . We focused more on refining our iron into high quality weapons . Having either the luck or good sense to build where we did , it was discovered at some point that we lived on a seam of high quality fuel . As such our metal was a thing of marvel . It did not rust easily , nor was it brittle that it would shatter with the cold . We focused mainly on weaponry for hunting - and occasionally combat with people getting too familiar with our lands - so when the distinct sound of metal armour clunking and the snow crunching beneath hard feet shattered the night air , I immediately knew there was trouble at hand . <newline> Every tribesman is trained in combat in some form or another , usually spears and bows for wild animals or more traditional weapons for our designated warriors . As the blacksmith 's apprentice I had long ago made myself a sword , some of the finest metal I 'd ever forged . It was more of a hobby than a weapon and yet was as strong and sharp as any weapon used by the warlord himself . I knew each and every scratch and sheen on its silvery body , it was as much a part of me as any limb on my body . As I stood in the darkness listening carefully to the unknown bodies outside , my eyes where pulled to it . Hanging on at wall of my hut , glinting softly even in the gloom . <newline> I stole a quick glance through a gap in the doorframe of my hut . Figures in black armour , no more than eight . This was no ordinary armour , it was distorted and twisted and yet reflected very little light . Long cruel looking blades hung from belts , marked with irregular hooks and filthy with dirt and dried blood . <newline> The most prominent figure was astride a horse , whom was also clad in thick dark plate . The leader 's armour was inlaid with gold trim and strips of cloth soaked red . Hanging from his back was an enormous black standard bearing an embroidered dragon wreathed in flame . They seemed prepared for war . <newline> I unhooked my sword from it 's bracket , it felt strangely warm in my hand . I would not stand any chance against these men but to leave the safety of my hut without a weapon seemed foolish . Running into the night , footsteps almost silent from years of hunting wildlife , I made my way to the grand hut of the towns strongest warrior . Before I could say a word , his door swung open silently and I was pulled inside , a hand over my mouth . I struggled for my blade but was met with the grim face of the warrior . He put a finger to his lips and I nodded , pulling his hand from my face . He was already suited in his leather , his blade poised and ready . He resumed squinting through a slit in his wall . Foolish of me to assume I was the only person not to hear these foreign intruders . Glancing through a gap , I could now see shadows moving in huts , hunters with bows hidden on rooftops and a small outfit of men lead by the blacksmith . I allowed myself to be a little relieved and looked at the head warrior . He was frowning , his eyes darted slightly as strategies churned through his brain . He looked worried . <newline> Through the small hole in the wall I could see the black clad squadron loftily make its way into the center of the village . It struck me now how odd they moved , controlled and without hesitation . They did not seem to shiver in the slightest even in their metal shells . They moved casually but in perfect synchronisation . It was clear now that these where no mere soldiers but elite units . <newline> Whatever thoughts I had where cut short as the soldiers stopped in the middle of the town center . The leader called out into the night air , <newline> `` The Draconian Order demands an audience '' . <newline> The silence that followed was broken only by the warrior breathing heavily at my side . <newline> The leader looked around , the red tassels on his armour blowing in the wind . He called out again , <newline> `` I seek an audience with the ruler of this.. hovel '' . <newline> The deep throaty voice of the warlord resonated through the night . `` Aye , that would be me '' . <newline> Obscured somewhat by the poor view , the warlord stepped out with a greathammer resting upon his shoulder . The warrior grunted something incoherent and hastily exited the hut . I looked on , now with a clear view . The tribesmen had pressed in and formed a ring around the foreigners . The leader in black paid this no heed but instead drew a wound piece of paper from a saddlebag . In a weary voice he began reading out , <newline> `` The Draconian Order request that you join our ranks or immediately disarm yourselves and give yourselves up to a lifetime of slavery '' , the leader looked over the paper , `` There 's more here but that 's the general gist , join us or we 'll crush you and your little village here '' . <newline> The warlord began laughing , hard booming laughs that quickly became accompanied by the surrounding tribesmen . Loud laughs that lacked mirth . Suddenly very serious , the warlord spat into the snow and with the veins in his face popping he shouted , `` WE 'D SOONER BE DEAD '' . <newline> The black clad leader dejectedly murmured , `` Yes , I thought as much '' , and nodded to a soldier at his side who immediately drew a knife and threw it into the village 's best warrior who was sneaking from behind . He fell down dead in an instant . <newline> <newline> <newline> *It does n't end there , but the word limit makes it difficult to add more . Plus the title only asked for the first part . *

2,"( I could n't post all of it so I 'll reply the rest . '' <newline> <newline> The nights in Animus City are dark . <newline> <newline> In some ways , they seem even darker than those in other cities . The street lights are always dimmed and traffic is prohibited during the late hours of the evenings . <newline> <newline> That said , this night was even darker than usual . It was autumn , winter clothes were long past put on , and the leaves were only halfheartedly hanging from their branches . I generally try not to pay attention to the temperature outside , but even I had to admit that tonight was cold . <newline> <newline> Besides the lack of human made lights , autumn itself always seemed to make nights darker . The fact that it was cloudy was n't helping either . <newline> <newline> Light rain fell from the sky , shutting out the natural light which was n't already covered by the clouds . The past few days have been filled with a continuous downpour , creating large puddles on the sidewalks and pretty much keeping people inside . <newline> <newline> It was supposed to be in an uneventful evening in District 4 , an evening with no problems , troublesome situations , or hassles that required addressing . That was how it was supposed to be , how it very well should have been , but tonight it could n't have been farther from the truth . <newline> <newline> Animus City , a city where a majority of the population is composed of people with inhuman abilities and technology far greater than any other country in the world , is still a city that is subjugated to the violence within its own walls . With a population of at least 40 million people , it goes without saying that trouble often rears its ugly head . <newline> <newline> Though I 'm not proud of it , I 'm often involved in such trouble . I 'm not a part of the grander schemes of heroism , but I 'm trying to make a difference nonetheless . I ’ m not a detective , but I ’ m something of a problem solver . <newline> <newline> Need me to find your cat for you ? I ’ m game . Being bullied and you need help ? I have just the solution . You need information on the latest Psudohuman fight ? I have what you need . <newline> <newline> It 's an sketchy job for a high schooler such as myself , one that has definitely brought me some unwanted attention , but in Animas , you got ta make money any way you can . <newline> <newline> I tend to like going on long walks at night . There are less people to focus on and that means I can spend more time alone by myself . <newline> <newline> Walking clears clears my head and soothes me in a way that only resting can . Call me old-fashioned , but I do n't think there 's anything I like more than taking a nightly stroll through the city by myself . <newline> <newline> I kept my eyes open for any trouble while simultaneously trying to enjoy the peace . <newline> <newline> The streets were devoid of all cars and the sidewalks held a very few people . Most people tend not to travel at night . It 's usually dangerous to go wandering about alone , especially if you 're a non-powered individual like me . <newline> <newline> I had very little to fear though . The people around my district knew me . These were my neighbors and clients . We all look after each other in District 4 . <newline> <newline> Some have known me ever since I was born , others knew me through work . So for the most part I believed I was safe as long as I stayed within my own area . <newline> <newline> As I walk through what seemed like an endless sea of neighborhoods , I felt something brush against my shoulder , knocking me away from my thoughts . <newline> <newline> “ Watch where you 're going , ” The man said stopping to address me . He looked towards the ground and spat . He seemed irritated but I could tell it was n't directed towards me . <newline> <newline> “ Sorry about that , ” I said putting on a smile and lowering my head . <newline> <newline> Other people are nothing but trouble . I know some people who would trash a person 's car just for looking at them funny , but me ? I 'm somewhat of a coward . <newline> <newline> My pride is a small price to pay for preventing unnecessary conflict . I 'm pretty sure I look harmless to a man who 's probably thrice my own age , but I do know how to handle myself in a fight . I just did n't know if this complete stranger had any powers . <newline> <newline> I ’ m sure you can understand why I decided to play it cool even though he walked into me first . The owner of the bar I work at often tells me that older woman would probably like me due to my submissive attitude . <newline> <newline> The man looked me up and down and nodded his head as though he was confirming something about me . I could n't help but tense up in response to his cold indigo eyes . <newline> <newline> I figured he was wondering what a student such was doing outside by himself . There was a distinct possibility that he was also planning on mugging me . I could n't really tell . His expression gave me nothing to work with . <newline> <newline> “ What are you doing outside so late ? You should go home , ” the man said avoiding my gaze . “ It 's dangerous for you to be out here so late. ” <newline> <newline> I wanted to make a witty remark about how I could take care of myself , but before I actually came up with something , he turned and walked away . <newline> <newline> I could n't help with snort . The man seemed to be in his late thirties and from the impression he gave me I felt as though he was n't from around here . There was something about him that rubbed me the wrong way . Perhaps he was dangerous and I got lucky . <newline> <newline> The man had made a good point though . I shouldn ’ t be outside beside by myself . There was safety in numbers and I was by myself . <newline> <newline> I deleted the confrontation from my brain and continued on with my walk . <newline> <newline> My usual nightly walks consisted of me journeying through my neighborhood first , then through the park and then back again . I had a routine that I liked to follow and I saw no point in straying from my path tonight . <newline> <newline> Little Brook Garden was by no means a garden . It was a huge forest with multiple paths that were large enough for a multitude of people to walk through without problems . <newline> <newline> The land of green almost felt out of place amongst the hundreds of houses and apartment buildings that surrounded it . <newline> <newline> I 've heard tales that back in the day this park as well as half of the district used to be a part of the Science Division , but it was shut down and destroyed after the many scientists and researchers who worked there had been discovered conducting illegal experiments on people . <newline> <newline> The laboratories were immediately shut down and destroyed . It was later replaced with various other infrastructures such as houses and a huge park . <newline> <newline> It 's basically a tourist attraction now . <newline> <newline> Some homeless people live illegally amongst the trees . During the day , stalls line the Central Road of the park and performers fight for the pedestrians ’ attention . <newline> <newline> Tonight , however , everything was as quiet as it should be . <newline> <newline> “ Gage ? ” <newline> <newline> For the most part I was trying to avoid making eye contact with her . The girl was in a school uniform smoking a cigarette on the park bench . I 'm surprised I did n't smell it earlier . I 'm must have not been paying attention . <newline> <newline> “ That 's my name . Try not to wear it out. ” Seeing as how she was waving at me to come closer , I felt I had no choice but to comply . <newline> <newline> “ What are you doing here ? In the park I mean. ” I could see that she thought I was doing something questionable with my time . I had a lot of questionable friends and I 'm sure she thought I may have been meeting up with one of them . <newline> <newline> “ Just out taking a walk , Bella , ” I sighed . “ You don ’ t have life outside your room so I know you ’ re not doing the same . <newline> <newline> Bellance Kepec is a free spirit with the unfortunate habit of running away from home . I ca n't really call the park her territory because it 's mine , but she often seen here or she can be found wandering the business districts in her uniform . <newline> <newline> I 'm a hundred percent sure that someone has been calling social services about her and her questionable motives . <newline> <newline> “ You 're right . I should be at home , talking to my friends , not having a life . But I decided to run away. ” Though the look on her face shows a smile , her tone betrayed her . <newline> <newline> “ Again ? ” I purposely sighed again . I gave her a stern look but she acted as though she did n't see it . <newline> <newline> “ I 'm out of places to go , so can I stay with you again ? ” She gave me one of her best smiles and tossed her raven black hair in a failed attempt to truly capture my attention . <newline> <newline> I 've got history with Bella . Nothing too large or grandiose , but it was there all the same . In all honesty I have very few friends . I do n't like people and I try not to make it known . <newline> <newline> But what I do like however is favors . As I said before pride is a small price to pay if I can avoid conflict . Listening to Bella complain about her life or letting her sleep over means I gain a point towards my favor each and every time . <newline> <newline> It 's hard to say if I actually think of Bella as a friend , perhaps a very good associate whom I tend to hang out with on certain occasions . <newline> <newline> “ No. ” I said not missing a beat . <newline>

2,"<newline> <newline> The Rise of Kings <newline> <newline> <newline> In the beginning there were four supreme beings that created the universe . The four Druids were all of different likenesses and each wanted to create a race of beings after their own image . The two female Druids were both creatures of great beauty and created the races of Virðar and Álfr . The two male Druids were both creatures of outstanding strength and could do anything if they put their minds to it . They created the races of Jǫtunn and Dvergr . <newline> Alas , the Druids realized that their beings had no place to live and so they planted a tree in the heavens . This tree was made of all seven woods in existence . The roots were made from beech signifying old wisdom . The heartwood of the tree was created using birch , proclaiming the beginning of time . The trunk of the tree was made of oak , symbolizing strength . The bark of the tree was made of hawthorn standing for protection . The branches were made of willow in order to signify the beauty of creation and the crown was made of spindle wood in order to manifest enlightenment . But the Druids were wise enough to know that the beings that they created would not be happy if they were to live forever and therefore gave them the gift of mortality in the form of elder wood . <newline> In the First Age , the four races lived together and bred amongst each other in order to populate the world . Virðar bred with Dvergr and made shorter children . Álfr bred with Virðar and they became even more beautiful . Dvergr bred with Álfr and became master innovators that created practical and beautiful tools such as the wheel . As the years passed , the race of Virðar became more and more aggressive and could not control their emotions . They first tried to wipe out the Álfr because of their envy of Álfric beauty . The Virðar also tried to steal all of the Dvergr gold . Knowing they would be next , the Jǫtunn built their army and became a savage race of warriors and rallied the Dvergr and Álfr against the Virðar and slaughtered them all . Only a handful of the Virðar made it out alive and pleaded to the Druids to punish the Jǫtunn for what they had done . The Druids looked down upon the world in disgust as to what had happened and so they took the branches of the Great Tree and separated the realms . Dvergr , Álfr , Virðar , and Jǫtunn would never live in the same realm together again . And as with most stories , as the ages passed , facts gave way to fiction , fiction to legend , legend to myth , and myth begot ignorance… <newline> The year was 1359 of the Second Age , and the people of Elysion lived in relative tranquility in the small trading village of Borealis . Nearby to the East lays The Shard ; an unchanging eternal structure of crystal , believed to have been cast down from the Gods . Bordering the south of Borealis was the central region of Adaesu . Within the valley live the monks , whose prolonged life has been credited to the shard nearby . Surrounding Adaesu also lays many gifts , left over from the times of prehistory ... Passages to hellish worlds . Dungeons with loot left untouched for thousands of years , and one of the few cracks through the Great Tree ’ s branch . <newline> <newline> This all lead to the expansion of Borealis , as travelers discover the wonders of this isolated region . It became a trade hub for all Elysion ; as the local camps of Neandolas , commonly referred to as 'villagers ' all use it as a communal market . It soon became clear with such rapid growth something needed to be done . It was there when the monks were believed to have intervened and were given the rights over the future expansion of the central realm . <newline> <newline> By the year 1560 four very different families had moved to Borealis , and through deals with the monks , controlling resources , and outright violence , they had taken control of Borealis . The monks still maintain the deciding vote for any plans made , however the families generally got what they want . <newline> <newline> The four families had very different ways of thinking though . House Stormhammer originally came from the mountains range of Faedor to the West . They spent their days sifting through rock for expensive minerals , and searching caves by torchlight . After some minor trades with Borealis , they felt the clan would do better living and working in the village , so the long journey began . House Stormhammer began to make use of the nearby shard , to get to the more valuable materials and within months had fully established themselves as a head family of Borealis . <newline> <newline> The small town then began to expand further as House Sarrowmerk , a local carpentry family from the Etherian forests to the North , moved into the picture . They soon discovered the wealth and relative luxury of Borealis after some small trades . Soon after , the monks gained some new furniture for their homes , along with new bridges in place of the old structures . New homes emerged , and the sly House Sarrowmerk moved in , taking over a substantial part of Borealis . <newline> <newline> Time passed , and the town expanded further . Borealis had truly become the centre of Elysion . A few quarrels had emerged between the two houses . Lord Sarrowmerk disagreed with digging up and polluting the world for the sake of wealth . And Lord Stormhammer disliked the way Sarrowmerk tricked their way into many situations . The town grew bigger , as more and more heard of this central hub of Elysion . <newline> <newline> Resources were stretched thin by the incoming immigrants . A new house stood up from the Eastern Plains of Fae , House Darrowmere . Until now , they had enjoyed lucrative food trades with Borealis , but it was clear that someone needed to take hold of the food situation . Lord Darrowmere was drafted in from his farming community to aid this starving town . Of course , a huge home right in the centre of Borealis was offered for his services to the growing empire . <newline> <newline> Borealis then lay in peace for a few decades , bar the odd drunken brawl between the pompous houses . The town grew into a city , as word spread further and further afield of the wonders of Borealis . The growth at times was not welcomed though , as undesirable characters from all parts of the world started to congregate in this melting pot of development . Thieves , drug addicts , black market traders , and murderers all moved in , alongside the hard working citizens of Borealis . <newline> <newline> A new breed of man was drafted in to help clear this plague of intolerable people . The hardened men of the Deep South were brought in to keep the streets clean , and to keep the newly imposed curfew under order . These men lived most of their lives under roofs made of ice , and were unaccustomed to this more temperate area . They soon settled in into this new way of life , as the honorable protectors of the city . The men of House Winterbane . <newline> <newline> For many years this group of houses lived together , and controlled the city of Borealis in an uneasy truce . Bickering and the odd fight outside The Powdery Keg was about as far as things went . <newline> <newline> The year was 1607 when the first strike fell . The families had lived in relative harmony , until two young lovers joined from Winterbane , and Sarrowmerk . The feuds erupted like fireworks . Both families disagreed with the relationship , but more than that , they were both offended at the others discontent . Things quickly spiraled out of control , and the fights grew fiercer until one morning the young couple were discovered at their home , throats slit in the night . <newline> <newline> Sarrowmerk blamed Winterbane , Winterbane blamed Sarrowmerk , and Darrowmere has strong suspicions the gruff figures of Stormhammer were somehow involved . The scraps in the streets soon grew into full blown violent feuds . Once dignified people were dragged from their homes and beaten in the streets , but still no conclusion was arrived at over the death of the lovers . <newline> <newline> In 1610 , the monks decided to step in after three years of fighting . Enough was enough . The members of the families were dragged into Adaesu , where the monks told them all houses were to leave the precious city . They were sent back in the directions they had originally come from . The angered houses soon realized that without all four of them in Borealis , the city would soon fall short to some degree , so they reluctantly agreed to go and establish themselves separately . Centuries passed , with the development of the four houses continuing strongly declared the beginning of the Third Age . <newline> <newline> By Year 40 of the Third Age , many foreigners had begun to arrive in Elysion , and their first stop was Borealis . These people were those who had been chased out of Aurora by the military head . They sought refuge in this supposed paradise . Many gifts and offerings were brought to the monks , who had again regained control of Borealis . The old Arcadian empire disagreed with the ways of the leader in Aurora , so also made the long journey to Elysion . They brought enough supplies to build a beautiful sandstone palace in the heart of Borealis , and also a much more precious gift . The old , yet grand , Obsidian Thrones . <newline> <newline> News soon spread to the exiled four houses of this influx of new travelers , and new wealth , and a flame for Borealis was reignited . Stormhammer marched into town in the year 65 , fully kitted and ready for battle . Needless to say no one stood in their way . The now booming city was the biggest trade hub in the world . Ownership would be fought for . The other three did n't take at all kindly to this invasion of the truce and so started the war of succession , the Rise of Kings . <newline>

2,"Galora 717 : Personal Recording Log : Rec . 201 <newline> <newline> *I 'm standing in front of my window , approximately 438 million kilometres away from the earth ’ s surface . The little blue dot which we call home sparkles in the farthest reaches of my vision . As I look out at the stars that have been gleaming for an eternity , like glitter on a black canvas , I 'm trying to imagine what a sort of existence I live if everything on the other side of this glass pane , despite it ’ s beauty , could kill me in an instant . Everything I know about anything would be lost , and all it would take is a little crack in this window . * <newline> <newline> <newline> 2 months earlier… <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Captain… Captain ... Captain ! ” Sev yells down my ear . I open my eyes and contemplate killing him , but my moral compass is still on path so instead I ’ ll just go with “ Yes ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Captain we ’ re getting an incoming call from earth , they ’ re saying it ’ s urgent. ” <newline> <newline> “ Urgh ... They abuse that word so much ” I grumble as I get to my feet “ Urgent this , urgent that. ” <newline> <newline> “ I know , but I think they ’ re serious this time sir. ” <newline> <newline> “ If they did n't sound serious every time they called they would n't be doing their jobs properly. ” He stares at me insistently . <newline> <newline> “ Fine . Lead on Macduff. ” <newline> <newline> This constant impending doom is getting tiresome and the urgency to do this and do that before everything blows up is becoming a monthly event . They need to find a new word to use besides “ urgent ” . It just doesn ’ t have the same impact as it once did . Anyway it ’ s the little things that I find most troublesome around here . Despite this urgency to speak with earth , the only thing that ’ s really bothering me right now is the lack of a carpet . You take it for granted every day that you wake up to the feel of a soft carpet caressing your frail morning feet . Instead I ’ ve been greeted with cold metal for the past 4 years . I could prepare slippers for when I wake up , but I always found that having liberated feet in the morning is quite the luxury . <newline> <newline> `` They 're on the other end of the line sir , you just need to press the button '' <newline> <newline> I 've never really liked the main deck , it needs more of the colour green . Too much blue , white and silver . Everything is too shiny . The buttons have no character and the never-ending beeping is starting to give me migraines . At first I was amazed at this spectacle of modern technology . The work of a hundred brilliant minds coming together to produce this immaculate creation of modern science . Everything has it ’ s purpose and works like a robotic brain to constantly keep us alive and moving . Like one big mechanical jungle . The pinnacle of human pioneering . And now it ’ s just a headache . The coffee machine is the only thing I don ’ t resent right now . <newline> <newline> “ So what ’ s the bet this time Sev ? Reckon World War 3 has started yet ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I 'm leaning towards technical problems over at their end , sir ” Sev answers . Always so serious . <newline> <newline> “ Well that would be slightly less dramatic now would n't it. ” I trail off as my finger hits the button . <newline> <newline> “ Captain James McCoy of the Galora 717 can you hear me ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Loud and clear Steve. ” I answer as I take a sip of my coffee . <newline> <newline> “ Captain McCoy we 've got something important we ’ d like to inform you of. ” He states in the most urgent sounding voice he can come up with . <newline> <newline> “ Fire away Steve. ” <newline> <newline> My train of thought wanders as I continue to imagine how much better this place would look with some natural green . Yeah that would look great . I might ask them about an upgrade when this burst of panic fades . <newline> <newline> “ Captain , I ’ ve got Colonel Richards on the line at the moment . He ’ s going to be explaining what ’ s going on . Please stand by ... ” I look at Sev , he looks back at me and I mime ‘ Colonel Richards ? ’ with my lips as if to ask why the heck Colonel Richards would want to speak with us . <newline> <newline> “ Captain James McCoy of the Galora 717 do you read me ? ” Says the most enforcing voice I 've ever heard . There are probably people who are promoted based on their voice and look alone , this guy is one of those guys . Square like chiselled jaw . Military hair cut . Face so squeezed of emotions that I would n't be surprised if he ’ s had surgery just to look like an asshole . If this guy is n't a stereotype , then I 'm not an astronaut . <newline> <newline> “ Yes sir , right here sir ” <newline> <newline> “ Captain McCoy I received a message about 12 minutes ago and I think it ’ d be best that I tell you and your crew myself . Is everyone there with you at the moment ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Errr ... '' I look around the room `` No sir , Daniel is elsewhere , would you like me to send for him ? ” <newline> <newline> “ If you could Captain , then yes . And hurry , this is a code 4. ” Depending on the seriousness of the call they will class it in codes when required . Most of the time they tell us straight up what 's wrong and we deal with it from there . But when we get a new recruit calling up or someone who follows protocol to a heartbeat , they will always state the code . It goes from code 1 to 6 . Code 1 being something along the lines of minor glitches in communications , so nothing serious . Code 6 would mean we ’ re probably all going to die , or we ’ re out of coffee . <newline> <newline> I turn to Sev “ Call through to Dan , see what he ’ s up to . Tell him whatever he ’ s doing to come down here now. ” <newline> <newline> “ Right away sir. ” <newline> <newline> By the time they actually tell us what ’ s going on the problem will probably have sorted itself out . But Colonel fucking Richards . A glorified war veteran who ’ s decided to dedicate his retirement to the front-line of the biggest space exploration project since the Mars landings . With all the funding and support he ’ s put towards this operation he pretty much owns it . For someone with so much disregard for life on our planet , he sure loves the idea of finding life on others , or moons in this case if we 're being technical . The ways in which he ’ s pushed this operation forward could seem somewhat unconventional , but he got it done . Nobody gets an operation this big up and running in 7 years without shaking up a couple of higher ups . Gone from aiming his sights at enemy soldiers , to aiming them at politicians . I 'm not complaining , in fact fast forwarding space exploration and human progress is one of the best ways to abuse one 's power in my personal opinion . He ’ s a man who ’ s not afraid to get his hands dirty . He ’ s stepped on a lot of peoples fingers climbing to the top , and does n't everyone know it . He ’ s only once personally called our ship and that was at take-off . 4 years pass and lots of words coming from him through messengers , but never directly from him . Until now his place among the living was questioned by the crew considering all the people he ’ s rubbed up the wrong way . <newline> <newline> “ I 'm here sir , what ’ s going on ? Heard it was a code 4 ” I hear Dan from behind me as he walks up the steps . <newline> “ Not sure yet but we ’ re about to find out… ” I look back at the screen ready to hit incoming call , and I ’ ve got to admit I am slightly intrigued by this whole situation . <newline> <newline> “ Colonel Richards , Daniel is here now. ” As I say that I can almost feel Dan ’ s confusion behind me after mentioning Richards . <newline> <newline> “ Boys , now don ’ t be alarmed , I understand that seeing my face must be quite a shock to you all given the circumstances . '' No shit . `` 17 minutes ago I received a message from Steve Quill , head of safety control , informing me of an asteroid storm heading your way . We believe our transmissions did n't pick it up because you 're so close to Jupiter , which could be interfering with our relays . '' He says bluntly . As if he ’ s told about twenty other astronauts the same thing this morning . <newline> <newline> `` Can we not bypass it ? Just go over it or around it ? '' I inquire and at the very same moment realize that chances are they 've already thought about that , and we would n't be having this conversation if we could . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm afraid not Captain . We 've tested multiple simulations and it would end up doing more harm than good . The storm will be upon you in roughly one hour . I 've got Terrence Fourn here who ’ s going to give you the details on what to prepare for . We ’ re all with you boys . ”

2,"She could smell them . The heady scent of wood and glue and cloth mingled pleasingly in her nose , cloying her and begging her to investigate . It was like coming home after a long vacation , or traveling to that exotic land that she had only heard of , but never explored . The scent was everything she had come to love in the thirteen short years of her life , and it was surrounding her ; everywhere , all she could sense . The intangible darkness that blanketed the room heightened that smell , making it more tantalizing and appealing than ever . This was not what she had expected when she descended the staircase down into the cellar . In fact , this was nothing like what she had expected . <newline> <newline> The sudden flash of match light cut through the darkness , shedding a dim meter of light in the hollowed-out earthen basement . Dust motes responded to the sudden change in air pressure , floating away from Lucia like she 'd startled them . The room was cool and comfortable , neither too dry nor too wet ; just damp enough not to stifle , yet dry enough to preserve whatever had been kept locked away here for so very long . As her eyes adjusted to the dim glow of her match , the young girl discovered that her nose had not deceived her . Relatively flat and squared on the sides , small shelves had been dug into the sides of the earthen room . Thin layers of crushed stone embedded into shelves kept the books they held free from the dirt they were held in . It was in the side of the shelf , and on the roof of the shelf , and Lucia was sure it was behind the books , as well . But though the earth-and-stone shelves were a peculiar sight to the young woman , they were not what kept her attention . <newline> <newline> Rather , it was the books themselves . Volume after volume and page after page , they filled the chamber from floor to ceiling in nine distinct shelves , and the stretched from the narrow doorway on either side into the darkness beyond the limit of Lucia 's light . Lucia stepped down off the last of the stone stair hesitantly , a feeling of irreverence crawling through her as she made her way into the vast library . Her slipper scuffed the ground , sending a pebble skittering along the hardened earth , and she paused to look down at her feet . The same rocks that lined the shelves had been strewn across the floor as well , helping preserve the dry atmosphere that was so important for keeping the books safe from mildew and mold . <newline> <newline> The wavering light of Lucia ’ s match tried its best to combat the darkness of the cellar . The nine shelves were arranged in almost a pattern , bringing to mind some ancient or esoteric runic marking . At what would be the center of the symbol a column of deeper darkness held sway despite other shelves behind it dimly visible . <newline> <newline> `` Curious and curiouser , '' the girl echoed the sentiment of proper young ladies everywhere when exploring instances that should not be . The match almost fell from her slender hand at what happened next . <newline> <newline> `` Light the candles , '' a masculine voice called out from that center darkness , as deep and echoing as a dry well . It was not an order , but the voice did carry a sense of power and control that made it almost impossible to deny as he continued . `` So that you can see me , and I can see you , and we shall both see what that is to be . '' <newline> <newline> She had not noticed any candles , but at the voice ’ s urgings Lucia did suddenly notice twin sets of candelabra , one on either side of the room . Quickly , for she was more curious now than afraid , the young girl lit all of the candles on the closer of the two stands . Finally light was cast into the opaque darkness in the center of the room . A reading chair faced away from Lucia , molded from the earthen floor in such manner as the shelves themselves had . She could see little of the man inside it , but an arm sat comfortably atop the armrest she could see , and a head of thinning gray hair could be spied over the chair ’ s back . An orange cat lay on the ground beside it , head tilted in the manner of the superior cat and yellow eyes shining eerily at Lucia in the candlelight . Holding her breath in anticipation , the girl crept around to see the speaker . <newline> <newline> A scream erupted from her small form , echoing muffled off the dirt walls and dust formed a small cloud as Lucia backpedaled briefly . The man in the chair was dead , vacant eyes staring eternally . His skin was pulled tight and was yellowed like parchment , though his features were young . A blackened tongue lolled from an open mouth where flies gathered to spawn . Though the corpse seemed decayed , the clothing was fresh and new , as if no time at all had passed for anything but the body ; or somehow the body itself died quicker than the world around it . <newline> <newline> `` Ah , yes , apologies for the décor . You would not believe how few housekeepers want to bother with employment from a cat . '' The orange tabby spoke , tiny pink tongue licking his whiskers at the end of the first sentence . `` Do you like to read , little girl ? I love to read ; there are more lies in the written word than anywhere else spoken . Poor Randal , too , he liked to read , but couldn ’ t handle it . Manners ! My name is Helel Ben-Schachar , but you may call me Ben . What ’ s yours ? '' <newline> <newline> The sight of the corpse had sent Lucia into shock . But the walls of shock can only hold so long against the absurdity of a talking cat , and so after only a short moment , Lucia 's eyes were fully locked on the feline . Although she was afraid , too she was bold and quite displeased at being called a 'little girl ' . That inner displeasure became Lucia 's safe rock in the swirling maelstrom of impossibility that her day was fast becoming . She grabbed onto it and put all of her will into it , and thus broke the surface of her own shock and awe . `` Lu-Lucia , '' she said , fumbling over the word . She hesitated , and then took a step forward to try and bolster her own resolve further . `` I am Lucia , '' she declared with a determined tone . `` And I 'm not a little girl , any longer . '' <newline> <newline> `` It is a pleasure to meet you , Lucia , '' replied Ben . The cat stood , then , up to his feet , and lazily stretched out with his chin to the ground and his tail in the air . Lucia watched with fascination as the cat 's fur seemed to ripple in the firelight , dancing with an impossible sheen of brilliance . The cat slowly recovered from its luxurious stretch , then padded across the floor to gently rub his cheeks along her ankles . Uncertain whether to be bothered or pleased by the affectionate gesture , Lucia lowered herself to a crouch and gently rubbed her fingers along the cat 's head . `` Oh , that 's quite nice , '' said Ben , closing his eyes and leaning into the stroke of the girl 's fingers . And then , quite unexpectedly , he opened his maw and bit her . <newline> <newline> `` Ouch ! '' Lucia cried , pulling her hand back and shaking it . She began sucking on the wound , which had pierced the flesh and was drawing blood . Yet so absurd was the situation that she did not immediately flee , but instead stared at the cat with abject confusion . `` You bit me ! '' she accused him as she straightened back up to her full height . <newline> <newline> `` It was necessary , '' Ben said sincerely , and then , `` and I apologize if you were hurt . I had to know , though , the taste of your blood . You see , if you were not old enough , this would all be for naught . But , '' with a lick of his teeth , the cat paused a beat before continuing , `` now I know the truth of it . '' <newline> <newline> `` You could have asked ! '' Lucia replied hotly . <newline> <newline> `` Ah , but then you might have lied , and that would n't do at all , '' Ben explained . Again , he began to gently nuzzle her ankles , as he continued his explanation , `` But you are thirteen ; the perfect age of maturity for a young woman . I do apologise for the earlier sentiment . You are quite correct ; you are not a young girl , but rather a woman , old enough to be wed and certainly old enough to serve as my companion . '' As the cat twined between her legs , he came out behind her , and then moved away from her towards one of the shelves . `` Come , '' he bid her gently . `` Come , I have a gift for you ; to make up for the bite . You never did answer my question . Do you like to read , my dear ? '' <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> Full disclosure : this was written by myself and my best friend , collaberatively . I am not the sole original author of this piece .

2,"Thanks for reminding me that I suck at starting and that 's why I 've been putting off getting passed this point ! <newline> ____________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> I tap the stack of papers against the desk and watch as Erin finishes her lesson , “ I ’ m done , do you need anything else ? ” as soon as she finishes . <newline> Alphabetizing students papers may not be the most fun I ’ ve ever had , but it does keep me busy , and it helps out Erin , which makes any task worth it . She turns to me , “ Already ? Hm , I don ’ t think I have anything else for you. ” <newline> I lean back in her chair and watch as the class packs up . I graduated , but since the school likes me so much , they let me hang around to keep out of the house , Erin was my favorite teacher from my time here . <newline> “ How are the kids ? ” I ask as the bell rings and a stream of people leaks out into the courtyard . <newline> “ Katie is getting pretty heavily into softball , which is strange , since she ’ s such a school oriented kid , you know ? Lucas is still recovering from the broken leg , so no football for him for two more weeks. ” She talks as she turns off the projector and wipes the whiteboard clean . <newline> “ Katie ’ s following your footsteps then ? Gon na be star ball player ? ” <newline> “ Hah , you make it sound like I was any good ! I only played because I enjoyed it , not because I was half decent. ” She walks over to the desk and I get up and out of her way . <newline> “ You say that , but you passed on sport genes. ” I file away the papers I was alphabetizing and sling my bag over a shoulder . I look back to see her walking toward me with her bag and sunglasses already in hand . <newline> “ You forget that John has those genes as well , it ’ s not all me . 2 half decent sets should make a decent right ? ” <newline> I chuckle and open the door to feel the blast of hot , dry air bombards my senses , “ Eh , I ’ m not so sure genes work like that. ” <newline> Quickly slipping on her sunglasses , she walks out into the blazing sun . “ I hate droughts , can ’ t even go home to a cold shower. ” <newline> I squint to see her lock the door through the low-hanging rays of light . “ Walking in the sun for a few seconds to and fro your jeep merits a cold shower ? ” <newline> With a look of pure disbelief , she says “ It ’ s 104 out here ! ” <newline> “ It ’ s a dry heat ! ” I say as she shoves me . <newline> We part ways and I get into my car , silently dreading the ride back to the place I live . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I enter the run-down apartment soundlessly , quickly slipping my key into my pocket and slipping my shoes off . I wait for a moment and try to listen for any movement behind the closed doors . Nothing . That means David is likely out buying , or passed out from injecting . I tiptoe to my sister ’ s room , gently setting my bag on the worn couch and put an ear to the door . I hear a page flip , and I turn the doorknob as quietly as possible and gently open the door . <newline> Squeek <newline> I hear a shift in the other room and rapid footsteps . I close the door quickly and step to the middle of the room , my heart rate climbing . <newline> No danger , I tell myself . There is nothing he can do to you . You can stop him now . <newline> The door in front of me swings open and in the doorway I see a broken shell of a man , shivering and wearing rags . His arm is lined with needle marks , so it must be Heroin this time around . <newline> “ Where you been ? ” David says , his voice barely a whisper , contrasting strongly with the crazed fixation that his eyes have come to continually hold . <newline> “ Out , working. ” I keep my voice level . I almost want to show him pity , but the image of a belt and the ghost of a hand on my throat keep me from such a thing . <newline> “ Working ? Well , I ’ ll be taking the rent you owe me. ” He holds out a hand expectantly while the rest of him slumps against the doorframe . <newline> “ I paid you last week , did you already burn through it ? ” <newline> He takes on an aggressive stance , showing how intimidating six and a half feet can be . “ You did n't give me anything , now cough it up before you end up living on the street ! '' <newline> I roll my eyes as I pull out my wallet and toss him a 50 dollar bill which he fails to catch . As it lands on the floor he dives for it like it 'll start running away . `` Happy ? I have an appointment all day tomorrow , so you 'll need to feed yourself , got it ? '' <newline> `` What ? Why ? What have you been telling them ? '' the crazed look seems to intensify as his old paranoia resurfaces . <newline> I rub my eyes and find it in me to offer the explanation for a fifth time this month . “ I see the doctors because I ’ m part of a project , I haven ’ t said anything about you. ” <newline> “ You always say that , always , always , always . . . ” He seems to lose focus and stares off into the distance . I take the chance and slip into my sister ’ s room before David can realize what happened . The mental problems have gotten worse over the years , and the drug use does n't help anything . <newline> With my ear to the door , I keep a finger on my lips as a signal to Lillian . I hear a quick gasp , and after a moment I hear slow footsteps and a door close , followed by more footsteps before I hear him flop onto his bed . <newline> A sigh of relief leaves my lips and I turn to face Lillian , my sweet little sister . I see her holding her book over her mouth , trying to hide the smile that gives away the fact that ’ s she ’ s restraining herself so much . I quietly crawl over to her and she put the book down to crawl to me . We meet in the middle of the room and I envelope her in a deep hug . She hugs me back and whispers into my ear , “ How was your day ? ” before scootching back to her book . I follow and quietly recall my day to her , “ Doctors , work , school , you . Simple enough day. ” <newline> “ I said HOW. ” she whispers , widening her mouth for the emphasis without the added sound . <newline> “ Oh , how , gottcha . Not bad , just lots of paperwork. ” I say as she cracks open her book and I sit next to her against the foot of her bed . <newline> “ You should come by more often , it 's lonely when you 're not around . . . '' <newline> I pull her close to me , `` Yes well , the doctors are very curious . I only recently let them take a look at me , so they want to check as much as they can right now to try and make up for lost time . '' <newline> She puts her hand on top of mine , her tan skin contrasting heavily with my pale white skin . We have the same parents , but you would n't guess it if you saw us together . My black hair against her light brown , her dark brown eyes against my purple -- when I 'm not wearing coloured contacts , at least . I 've been wearing coloured contacts since I was 6 , purple eyes tend to draw more attention than necessary , but all the other kids knew I was different anyway . As we grew older they stopped . Not only because I learned how to use the extra bit of strength I had over them , but because the feeling of uneasiness they felt when they were younger had faded . <newline> Only a few doctors know about my differences , Lilian has never seen anything different , and David is so far gone that I doubt he remembers anything about me . Those doctors have been pestering me to let them study me since I was born , lack of reproductive organs with no complications tends to cause quiet a buzz , my eyes only caused more interest . My parents were against it , and they refused to give consent for the doctors to share what they knew . After Mom died , the requests started coming to me since I was 16 and able to consent to the decision . I was hesitant until we started to run out of money in David 's savings account a year ago , the compensation for them figuring me out was enough to cover anything we needed , but I 've been saving what I did n't need to use in hopes of getting Lilian away from him . <newline> <newline> <newline> I take the book from her hands and she snuggles close to me as I read to her .

2,"Alex was waiting for Larita in the parking lot when she got out of the doctor 's office . Larita 's friend was all smiles as she leaned against her car 's door . `` Hey , you 've kept me waiting . You said you 'd be done fifteen minutes ago . What are you , some kind of witch ? '' Alexis said , winking . <newline> <newline> Larita gave a weak smile in return . `` I hope so . They did the procedure , but I do n't really feel very different . I 've been trying to use magic on my way out , shoot sparks or something , but I have n't been able to do anything yet . '' Larita glanced at her hand thoughtfully . `` The doctor also said to come back tomorrow . She said there 's something we need to talk about . '' <newline> <newline> Alex shook her head , still smiling . `` You remember Cory , right ? He graduated with us last week , and he could n't use magic until last month . When he went to the doctor , they told him the same thing , but they just wanted to be sure he could cast without hurting himself . They were worried he 'd be too strong ! '' Alex dragged Larita over to her car 's driver 's seat and opened the door . `` I 'm sure you 'll be fine . Here . Try starting my car . '' <newline> <newline> Alex 's excitement was contagious . Larita felt optimistic as she sat down in the car . Her friend was right , Larita was worrying too much , and this was going to be it . After years of waiting , she was about to use magic to get a stupid car to run . She would n't be dependent on other people doing everything for her . <newline> <newline> Alex hopped into the passenger seat . `` Okay . What you need to do is focus . Magic is kind of like whistling . You have to keep trying until you find your sweet spot , but once you learn how to cast , it 's effortless . '' She pointed at the ignition lever , a metal pole sticking out behind the steering wheel . `` It 's daytime , so yellow magic will be the easiest to use . Think about the sun , the energy flowing through it , and send that energy into the car . '' <newline> <newline> Larita nodded , grabbing the ignition lever . She focused all of her thoughts on the sun and on turning the car on , feeling giddy as she did so . <newline> <newline> Nothing happened . <newline> <newline> Larita tried grabbing the lever harder , then more loosely . She tried thinking about how warm the sun felt , about how it hurt to look at it , about the fact that it was literally a nuclear explosion that had been going off longer than the Earth had existed . Still , nothing happened . <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure there is n't some kind of trick ? '' Larita said , glancing nervously at Alex . Her friend shook her head , still grinning , but not as widely . `` Turning on a car should be easy . Some people have a hard time doing so , but since it 's taken so long for you to be able to use magic , it should be easy ... '' <newline> <newline> Larita frowned in focus , trying to turn the car on for a few more minutes . Finally , she gave up , leaning back in the car seat . <newline> <newline> Alex stopped smiling , the first time she had done so since meeting Larita . `` Maybe it will be a little while before you can use magic . You just got out of the doctor 's . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 'd better be true , '' Larita growled frustratedly . <newline> <newline> The two friends switched seats and drove off wordlessly . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Larita stared out the window while they drove . The route they took ran parallel to the edge of their world . The city the two friends lived in was inside a bubble of existence : where the city 's borders ended , there was literally nothing . The ground stopped abruptly at a wall of sorts . It was completely colorless - not black , but invisible , in a sense . There was no way past it . It was completely immobile , impenetrable , impassable . Somewhere above the city , it gave way to the sky , but it was difficult to tell exactly where . <newline> <newline> After a few minutes , Alex turned towards Larita . `` Are you still up for going to the mall ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , sure , '' Larita said unenthusiastically . <newline> <newline> Alex sighed . `` It 's weird . Like I said , Cory was almost as old as you when he was finally able to use magic , and he 's able to do all kinds of stuff with it . I can start a car , but he can practically drive one without turning it on . '' She turned towards her friend . `` I have to think that you 'll have so much more natural ability than everyone else , too , right ? '' <newline> <newline> Larita nodded in response . `` I sure hope so . That 'd be a lot better than being , you know - '' Larita took a deep breath before finishing - `` colorless . '' <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> The two friends felt better by the time they arrived at the mall . Larita tried unsuccessfully to open the mechanical doors at the entrance , but she just shrugged it off . <newline> <newline> `` What should we do ? '' Alex asked after they walked in . `` We 're starting our jobs in a few days . We could go shopping for that '' <newline> <newline> `` No , we should just buy a bunch of board games again , '' Larita said , chuckling . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , he appeared . <newline> <newline> A young man , who was n't in the mall beforehand , simply showed up in the middle of the hallway . There was no noise , flash , or warning ; he did n't exist one moment , and then the next , we was right there . He was dressed in some kind of colorful robe , something Larita had never seen before , that was soaked with sweat . He was holding onto a large sword in one hand and something that glowed brightly in the other . <newline> <newline> Everyone nearby stopped what they were doing , turned to look at him , and backed away . When the man appeared , he fell kneeling on the ground , breathing heavily . Gradually , he looked up at the crowd around him and turned to survey them all , sheathing the sword on his back . When he faced Larita , he looked like he was about to cry or scream . <newline> <newline> When the man noticed the entrance doors , he stopped briefly before making a couple of stumbling steps towards them . Suddenly , without a word , he sprinted past everyone and out of the mall . <newline> <newline> Everyone in the crowd started shouting at each other like they had all just witnessed a murder . Larita and Alex were certainly spooked . Mall security officers quickly showed up , followed by police a few minutes afterwards . Larita and Alex were interviewed by the police for half an hour before they could leave . <newline> <newline> Afterwards , the two friends considered going shopping together , but decided things had gotten too bizarre and that they wanted to just go home . Alex offered her Larita a ride , but Larita turned it down . `` I want to be by myself for a while . My place is right across the forest next to the mall , so it 's as fast to walk back as it would be to drive . '' <newline> <newline> `` The forest ? '' Alex asked . She stopped abruptly and grabbed her friend 's shoulder , looking into her eyes concernedly . `` That 's where the pit is . Are you feeling all right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , why ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're not thinking about ... '' Alex swallowed nervously . `` ... about going into the pit , are you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? No ! Absolutely not ! '' Larita shot Alex an irritated look . `` I really just want some time to myself ! But I 'm going to be fine . '' Larita sighed . `` Look , I do n't even know whether I 'm - I 'm colorless yet . I still need to see the doctor tomorrow . But even if I am , I 'm going to be okay . I 've got a lot going on in my life to be proud of right now , and that 's not going to change . '' <newline> <newline> Alex nodded . `` All right . I just - I do n't want anything to happen to you . If you do try to kill yourself ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , I know . '' Larita grabbed Alex 's arm . `` I 'm sorry I got mad at you . I appreciate that you 're concerned . It 's just - I really am going to be fine . '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay . '' Alex let go of her friend . `` Can you at least text me when you get home ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course .

I 'm going to get to the bottom of this and if I have to take the whole country to hell just to do it than I will . Not much the American people can do anyways . I 've already won my second term . <newline> See you in hell Eric . <newline> //////// # # # # # **** <newline> <newline> <newline> TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA <newline> We present the findings of our commission about the devastating event that was the salvation of the human race . Ten commissioners -- five republicans and five democrats -- came together in a time of great political division to investigate who was responsible for this act without the supervision or approval of the world 's governments . <newline> <newline> How could this happen ? Who could have done what leaders , scientists , and armies have failed to do since the beginning of time -- bring universal peace to the world ? <newline> <newline> We have come together without dissent to compile this report for the executive office to administer our recommended reprimands on the parties involved . World peace is a crime that will not go unpunished . No non-elected person should have the power of those who are the representatives of the people . Only we , the global representatives of the human race , have the know-how and the authority to perform such an act . <newline> <newline> To maintain the classified nature of this report we took the necessary precautions of hiring an oversight committed to observe this commission . To ensure sensitive material did not leak out to the second committee , a third committee was created to oversee the first two committees . Each committee crossed checked and observed each other simultaneously with the supervision with the Waste and Means committee . <newline> <newline> After a month , the Waste and Means committee created four more committees to oversee the three other committees and themselves . With all these precautions in place we can say without a doubt that the report will not see the sight of the general public . If during the event the report does leak to a citizen , each copy has been encoded to send a G.P.S . signal of the location to the Internal Revenue Service for the proper disposal of the individual . <newline> <newline> Our mandate was expansive and covert . We quickly learned that this goes far deeper than we originally imagined and encountered heavy resistance from the Department of Justice . Through extra legal methods we have reviewed over 27,000 documents , arrested 179 suspects and obtained four crucial accounts . <newline> <newline> No one was prepared for the events that occurred on May 11th of last year . The first report came from a local Melbourne , FL police officer who had a shoot-out with four armed men . After 42 rounds were fired no one was hurt . At the time it was considered a miracle . <newline> <newline> Later word quickly spread of reports of attempted violence ending without injury . Battles that were being fought across the world were only making noise , and homicides plummeted as it turned out that the human race suddenly became incapable of harming one another . People were forced to deal with each other without violence . <newline> <newline> Violence , as the world was quick to learn , was the key motivator of the global economy . Wars created the need for the manufacturing of weapons , medical care , body armor and armored vehicles , government aid to war-torn countries , funeral parlors , and other manifestations of political might . Without the possibility of violence in the world stock in these companies nose-dived , creating the biggest depression the world has ever seen since the 1930s . Overnight an entire industry became irrelevant and an estimated 390 million people worldwide lost their jobs . <newline> <newline> The world rejoiced in the peace until the rioting started . Humans were unable to harm one another but still had the capability to destroy property . Police were unable to quell the violence because they too were incapable of using force against the rioters and the rioters themselves could not attack the police . For weeks the destruction raged until boredom set in . <newline> <newline> After countless interviews , a score of records and a googlebyte of information the committee was left lost and confused . It was n't until a subpoena of the Justice Department that revealed many references to a company named Blyco Industries in memos from the C.I.A . to M.I . 6 that things changed . When brought before the committee the director was not very forthcoming . That 's when we discovered the entire intelligence community was operating against the committee since day one . <newline> <newline> We were led astray by the very people who were claiming to be helping with our investigation . All seemed lost until an intern found a crucial piece of information about Blyco Industries . It was discovered that there was a long ongoing lawsuit between Blyco Medical and another Blyco Industries over the copyright use of the name . As we delved deeper into the lawsuit it was discovered that Blyco Industries had n't responded to the lawsuit and the Department of Justice had been burying the case in an endless pile of red tape . <newline> <newline> The `` other '' Blyco employed an identifiable logo of a metal sheep with a blue ring around it . At this time we do not know the importance of this logo . <newline> <newline> At the same time the scientists at C.E.R.N . were hard at work investigating the phenomenon that prevented a human being from harming another . They discovered a new high frequency radio wave had been introduced to the world . Like the high frequency that causes dogs to squirm , this one causes the synapses in the frontal lobe , the lobe of the brain many believe where our decisions come from , to alter the dopamine levels whenever the brain considers a violent action . We may fire the gun or swing the knife but we will not hit our targets intentionally . <newline> <newline> The scientists at C.E.R.N . traced the signal to their local cell phone tower . A device was installed over a decade ago with the Blyco logo . C.E.R.N . contacted Blyco Medical for more information but quickly got a mouth full from the C.E.O . <newline> <newline> This was not the first device with this `` other '' Blyco logo . For the past sixty years numerous devices have been uncovered with the Sheep logo . Often the other devices had a decommissioned nuclear missile attached to it . A new lawsuit was filed with this information that led the committee to determine that this `` other '' Blyco Corporation was responsible for saving the world . <newline> <newline> These four accounts at first seemed circumstantial but in fact exposed a deep , long-running secret world-wide black economy hell-bent on destroying the world itself . The committee has taken up the task of adding information into this narrative that will fill in the gaps that are left in these testimonies . <newline> <newline> Because of the confidentiality of this investigation we were unable to obtain the proper legal warrants needed . Instead we were forced to use other methods to gather the necessary information . <newline> <newline> The first is from a young man named Frank Agni . We discovered Mr. Agni was already in legal trouble facing three counts of disturbing the peace and dozens of violations U.S code Title 18 Part 1 chapter 13 Stature 249 . In guise of a special city prosecutor we sent an intern to learn more information about this other Blyco Corporation in return for a lesser sentence . **** <newline> <newline> ****To keep the confidentiality of this project we did not interfere with the proceedings of his trial and he was sentenced regardless of this disposition . <newline>

2,"***** <newline> <newline> I am a storyteller . <newline> <newline> This world has been my stage for many , many years . <newline> <newline> I tell tales of woe and love and knights and dragons and heroes and magic . <newline> <newline> There is but one that is true . <newline> <newline> Though you wo n't believe it . <newline> <newline> No one does . <newline> <newline> <newline> Tonight I stand in a cavern , filled with the flickering light of a blazing fire . I am <newline> dressed in thick furs and hides , draped over my body to ward off the chill that yearns to fill my bones and muscles . <newline> <newline> Gathered around me are dozens of people , simple folk . They wear fur and sit eagerly awaiting the traveler 's tale . <newline> <newline> I begin the same way I began for you . <newline> <newline> They are enthralled by my voice , even the adults . <newline> <newline> I stand against the cave wall , the fire burning before me and two groups huddled around to stare at me . <newline> <newline> `` Are you curious to hear the tale ? '' <newline> <newline> I ask.They shout in unison , eager indeed . <newline> <newline> `` Look to the fire . '' <newline> <newline> I say . They do . Leaning forward in anticipation . <newline> <newline> In my pocket is one of many small vials I possess of a simple dust . <newline> <newline> `` Closer . '' <newline> <newline> I say . <newline> <newline> They lean in . <newline> <newline> `` And so , friends , the story begins ! '' <newline> <newline> I shout it , my voice rich with the skill of a practiced weaver of stories . <newline> <newline> With that I throw the vial into the base of the fire and the orange bursts into a vibrant tapestry of green , red , blue , purple , an inferno that fills the cave with light and fury . <newline> <newline> And pictures . <newline> <newline> The fire becomes my tale as I begin , voice deep and husky . It weaves into the images I describe . <newline> <newline> They do not waver , they stare deeply . <newline> <newline> Such is my gift . <newline> <newline> <newline> There is a place . <newline> <newline> Far , far away . <newline> <newline> A rich world of people and nations and beasts . Where we are concerned is the continent the people there call XX-NAME-XX . Long before the time of our story were four great heroes . <newline> <newline> The Engineer . He was intelligent and quick , a creator of mighty instruments and a seeker of knowledge . <newline> <newline> The Mage . She was bright and filled with awareness of the magical energies that exist beyond our sight , a weaver of fire and water and air to her will . <newline> <newline> The Archer . Agile and nimble , he was a hunter with the deep respect of his elders for all things that live and grow and required his love . <newline> <newline> The Warrior . Strong and burly , he was without fear and filled with the purest courage and dedication to protecting those that others might call weak . <newline> <newline> In the darkest hour of the land , when beasts from the pits of darkness roamed the fields and sowed death and destruction , these four led the mightiest army assembled to war against these creatures . <newline> <newline> As one fist they crashed into the beasts and thrust them back , back into their abominable pits . Banishing them through a portal to the other side . The four heroes sacrificed themselves , becoming wardens of the gateway and sealing it 's black doors shut to protect the land from ever suffering these daemons again . <newline> <newline> It cost them their lives . <newline> <newline> Thousands of years passed and the land recovered . <newline> <newline> Descendants and followers of the heroes built homes and farms , populating and growing with the other people until great cities were built . Soon the land was populous and grand . <newline> <newline> Which is where our story begins . <newline> <newline> For no place of growth and knowledge is free of greed and evil . <newline> <newline> And avarice . <newline> <newline> It was a dark and cold night , lamps maintained by the City Watch burned away some of the darkness but it was thicker and heavier than usual . <newline> <newline> Four men in heavy brown robes of the Priesthood walked together , quietly chanting prayers for the people of the city and swinging an incense lamp on a heavy iron chain . The perfumed smoke wafted into the air as they walked slowly through the streets . <newline> <newline> The few City Watch reverently lowered their heads as the monks passed , they were not uncommon in the night to bless the people and keep away what dark spirits might lurk in the shadows . <newline> <newline> These monks had a different , darker purpose . <newline> <newline> They chanted their way towards the King 's Keep , a gigantic jutting tower surrounded by low walls and thick gates . It overlooked the vastness of the now sleeping Capital City . <newline> <newline> The guards on duty were half asleep , two young men of the City Watch . <newline> One of them sleepily stepped out to meet the monks , stifling a yawn with his right hand . <newline> <newline> Without warning the lead monk swung the burner violently , the ember filled pot connecting with the guard 's head with a resounding crack . The young man collapsed . <newline> <newline> The second monk raised a small crossbow , firing a bolt into the eye of the second before he could move to draw his sword . <newline> <newline> Without a word the last two dragged the bodies out of sight , removing their brown robes to reveal the red and yellow uniform of the City Watch guardsmen . <newline> <newline> They would stand post at the gate . <newline> <newline> The others removed their robes to reveal the red and silver tunics of the Royal Guard , impossible to come by . Or so they said . <newline> <newline> Quickly they entered the courtyard , passing by a few groups of guards without question . <newline> <newline> Up through the heavy main doors they went , up a winding staircase , up and still further up . <newline> <newline> `` Quietly now , '' the older of the two said with a hushed whisper as they entered the lion 's den . <newline> <newline> Swiftly they split and moved behind the four lounging guards in the antechamber . They had glanced up to see the red and silver , then back to their game of dice . <newline> <newline> `` What 's the word lads ? '' one of them said . <newline> <newline> Without response the older one jerked back the man 's head and slid an incredibly sharp knife through the soft flesh of his throat , spraying hot red blood in a great arc over the other three . <newline> <newline> The younger attacker drove his knife through the back of another guard 's neck , severing his spine at the base of his skull . <newline> <newline> With a swift motion the older slammed his knife sideways through the temple of the third real Royal Guard . <newline> <newline> The fourth was young but apparently a veteran . Unlike the others he pushed off the table and threw his chair backwards , flinging himself away from the second knife attack of the younger imposter . He rolled backwards out of the chair and clumsily found his footing , not bothering with the standard issue blade at his hip but instead a short blade . <newline> <newline> The older imposter did n't express it but he was concerned . The short blade was gifted to survivors of the Ninth Legion that returned from the bloodiest campaign against the Northmen . <newline> <newline> `` Wake up boys ! '' <newline> <newline> He shouted the words even as he was dropping into a guarded stance with the short blade in one hand . <newline> <newline> There were scuffling sounds from somewhere that the imposters could n't identify . They exchanged brief looks of concern before a tapestry on their right burst open and a stream of guards flowed into the antechamber . <newline> <newline> `` You plan on coming quietly ? '' the guard survivor spoke calmly . <newline> <newline> The imposters shook their heads . <newline> <newline> `` So be it . '' <newline> <newline> Arrows thudded into the two men and they crumpled instantly , like children 's puppets with their strings suddenly cut . <newline> <newline> <newline> The alarm went up , ringing across the city . Assassins had attempted on the life of the King . <newline> <newline> In the midst of it , two monks chanted through the streets , loudly praying for the safety of the people and their king . <newline> <newline> On the outer city wall , two guards lit their lantern and began a patrol along the length of the wall . With an alarm ringing patrols were doubled and they were dragged from their warm beds into the chill of the night . <newline> <newline> `` Assassins . Ruin my night . '' One grumbled . <newline> <newline> Suddenly he realized his partner was n't beside him , turning he saw the cause . <newline> Outside the city the once dark field was dotted with lights . Lights that were n't supposed to be there . <newline> <newline> `` That ca n't be good . '' <newline> <newline> ***** <newline> <newline> I have another one but it 's just way too big to fit on Reddit unless I split it up like crazy .

2,"The scene of war has changed , but not enough to change its artistic weaves . Like the knit of a quilt the way of war has not changed , however what we use to make the quilt has . <newline> <newline> Lord K stood within the observation platform of his ship , the ISS Rabbadon , a Dreadnaught Class Imperial Capital Starship . Looking out into the infinite star ocean he stood in awe of the vast plethora of stars and constellations . Lord K continued to look into space , however within the reflection of the aluminum glass , he noticed his uniform was in slight disorder . <newline> Fixing his belt line and cloak he took time to check his uniform . His Oval Officers Cap was straight and level , with the brim of the cap barely covering his eyes . Adjusting his Commanders coat and its various decorative lapels he adjusted the brace chain that held his cloak up . The black bush fur collar will need to be replaced soon , Lord K noted to himself . <newline> <newline> He took time to also fix his lock step tall boots and the blousings above his boots . A slight scuff on the top of his boot annoyed him . <newline> <newline> Hearing the soft hum of the elevator behind him gave lord K the time to expect company shortly . Finished with his adjustments the Lord looked out once more to appreciate the massivness of space . <newline> <newline> A woman emerged from the elevator , due to the dim lighting of the observation deck it was hard to make out the rank upon her shoulder . Lord K was not very worried , as he was the highest ranking Officer aboard . <newline> The female averted her eyes and kneeled before Lord K , the Lord noticed and had haphazardly forgotten , Common officers and people could not loom upon the faces of Lords and top officials . Lord K donned his face mask , and asked the female to stand . She stood and introduced herself . <newline> <newline> `` My Lord , I am Leftenant Gromwell , at your service . I am here to inform you that undocking procedures are complete . The ship is awaiting your commands . '' ending with a clean salute , the leftenant stood in perfect military attention . <newline> <newline> With a heavy breath Lord K took another look back into space and began to walk to the elevator . <newline> <newline> The leftenant wore a standard issue Imperial Navy Blue Longsleeve blouse and black long skirt and female lock step short boots . Upon her head she wore the issued female officer ball cap . Her appearance was the least of Lord K 's worries . Noticing a folder and PIN in the Leftanant Gromwells hands he shifted his glance to her . <newline> <newline> `` Pull up the passanger manifest , who is aboard my vessel . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes my lord , at once . '' Taking her PIN out . <newline> The leftenanr pulled out a rod tipped with a sphere and drew and large circle in the air , making a holograph of the list and profile of 3 Passengers . <newline> <newline> `` Lord , the first passanger is Lord Mi , under the direct command of the emporer he is here to assist you in your mission . '' <newline> More like he was sent to watch and grade me , lord K though to himself . <newline> The leftenanr continued after seeing no visible reaction from Lord K. <newline> `` Our second passanger is Mr. Gearfried , creator of the Valkyrie Unit and is currently located in the the Flight bay . He is not authorized for entry there , would you like me to remove him ? '' <newline> <newline> Lord K stoped just before the elevator and pushed the code nessary to gain access the Command Bridge into the raised console on the wall . <newline> <newline> `` Allow him to do as he pleases , send him notice that all personnel will be locked down just before warp , after that send him instructions to modify my unit '' <newline> The leftenant took note and nodded her affirmation . She then pulled up the 3rd passenger , with an air of concern and admiration she announce the mans name . <newline> `` Lastly , the Emporers 23rd son , Prince Vlad De Sol Dragonia , here to skirmish alongside of you my lord . I am instructed to remind you of your position as well in the shadow of the emporer . '' <newline> <newline> `` There is no need to waste words , such talks are below my existance young leftenant . You will do best to never question my loyalty , even under the leash of another . '' <newline> Slightly stricken with fear and embaressment the leftenant nodded with acknowledgement and stood silent . <newline> <newline> The chime of a bell sounded the elevators arrival . Lord K stepped in as soon as the doors were fully wide with the LT gromwell in tow . Entering the access code into the consle once more the lord k took another glance at yhe Leftenant to assess . He saw no quarrel with her , and deemed her worthy to serve . The others were not as fortunate . <newline> <newline> The leftenant stood still and pondered to herself , she heard stories of the Great Lord K. He was known as the Lord of the Storm , a man capable of total desolation . His recent battles involved the recent rebellions in the outer colonies . <newline> <newline> The Emporer sent Lord K to pacify and restore order and if they did not comply to erase their existance from all mankind . <newline> The diplomats could not establish peace . Lord K then anounced battle , the rebels deployed their fleet of 300,000 Starships . The Lord , with 1 Capital ship and a small fleet of 300 battleships , won the battle with 2 ships lost due to their own deficiancy . The Lord K came home with utter victory . <newline> <newline> The leftenant ressured herself . If she was still alive this long then she should be in the clear . <newline> <newline> With a slight shudder and audible locking mechanisms the elevator stopped and opened . A uniformed Marine stood by the door and observed the arrival of Lord K. A click of the marines boot heels and his yell sounded the entire command deck to attention . <newline> <newline> `` Attention on deck , Lord K on Deck ! '' <newline> <newline> All personnel stood to attention and resounded the call in verbatum . <newline> The Marine turned directly in front of Lord K and offered a sharp salute . <newline> `` The command deck reports nothing unusual and in good order . We await your further orders my lord ! '' <newline> <newline> Lord K returned the salute and walked down to his chair . Before he took a seat the captain of the ship approached him and gave Lord K a sealed folder . <newline> <newline> Lord K took the folder and called everyone to be at ease . The entire deck went back to their seats and continued to monitor the ship . The lord opened the folder amd read its contents . <newline> Lord K could not be more suprised than he was now . He handed the folder back to the captain and chimed the communications officer . <newline> <newline> With little effort the communications officer patched the Master of the ship to the ships intercomm . <newline> <newline> With the tone of command the brassy voice of lord K came forth from the speaker of the Capital ship . <newline> <newline> `` Attention all personnel upon the ISS Rabbadon , lend me your ears . This day we embark on our short journey for the glory of the Empire . Our mission is to lay seige to a planet . '' <newline> <newline> The lord took a pause , seemingly hesitant . <newline> `` We will seige the Silver system , and desolate the planet of Lustinia . Their rebellion has costed us progress and lays shame upon the empire . Know now , i expect nothing but your continued obediance . This will be another routine assault . We expect no real challege . '' <newline> With a short breath and halt the Warlord picked up the mic once more and continued his speach . <newline> <newline> `` Crew , be advised we carry imperial guests . The emporer has graced us with the company of his own blood . The prince Vlad de sol Dragonia is aboard and will be a prt of our skirmishes . '' <newline> <newline> `` We also have recieved new blood aboard the crew , please enlighten them . We are the Rabbadon ! By blood or fire , the emporer will have his prize . For the glory of the Empire ! '' <newline> With a loud roar heard through out the hull of the ISS Rabbadon , the pride of Dragonia was heard . <newline> <newline> Captain Ivann saluted the Lord K as he left the bridge with the you leftenant in tow . Restricting his scope of audience he called the ship to order and prepared for warp . Captain Ivann could feel that somehow the Lord K was disturbed , something unusual was going on . But orders were order and the Captain followed Lord K to the very syllible . After all the order to attack Lord K 's home planet , is an order directly from the Emporer . <newline> <newline> This was a draft i had in mind to creat my first novel , but I decided to have a different setting instead . I should work on it more in the future

2,"Trapped in a world or secrets and lies , is the twelve year old Eliza ; an ordinary girl with an extraordinary situation . Her parents perished in a mysterious fire that reduced her home to ashes , leaving her with nothing but sad memories and a feeling of guilt . A day after the tragedy , she sought refuge with a family friend . She now sat on a creaking and rickety rocking chair , idly rocking back and forth as she stared out to the far distance . Her plaited white dress heavily contrasted by the engulfing shadows of the dark room , as if to further emphasize her loneliness . The mournful whistle of the dawn wind did nothing but worsen Eliza ’ s sadness . <newline> <newline> She looked down on her thin , pale hands that shook uncontrollably as she forced herself to forget . She closed her eyes , hoping to shut out the world outside . Suddenly she was back to that night , the night that changed her life forever . And everything was crystal clear : The towering pillars of fire ascending to the heavens . The echoing screams of alarm . The wailing of sirens . The rush of panicked footsteps . The collapse of burning debris of which she once had called home . And in a little over an hour , her life crumbled to burning pieces . Tears fell from her eyes like rain . Her frail body trembled as she drowned her grief with tears . <newline> <newline> Soft , slender arms suddenly wrapped around Eliza , gently brushing away stray strands of her silk-like sienna hair . Eliza looked up to find her sister . Her hazel eyes gleamed at Eliza , filled with sincere compassion . It was Karin . <newline> <newline> “ You shouldn ’ t think about the past too much , or you ’ ll end up with white hair on no time. ” She teased , casting a vibrant smile down on Eliza . <newline> <newline> Eliza smiled back weakly , slightly relieved from her sorrow . Karin released Eliza and tucked her hands behind her back . Then she childishly marched in front of Eliza . Karin looks her up and down . She shook her head disapprovingly . <newline> <newline> “ Look at you… You ’ re a mess . What do you think will Ein think if he sees you like this ? ” <newline> <newline> At that , Eliza blushed . She shrank further away into the shadowy recesses of the rocking chair . It did not require further evidence to prove Karin ’ s words . Eliza ’ s charcoal-stained white dress has been through more than it was made for . Her hair , though naturally straight , lay in an untidy tangle that simply refuses to yield to neither comb nor brush . Her eyes were already set deep within their sockets , because of lack of sleep . Her once glowing skin was now sickly pale . Grief really does takes its toll on people . <newline> <newline> “ Tell you what , ” Karin held out her hand to Eliza . “ I ’ ll fix you up , then we ’ ll head over to our favorite restaurant . My treat. ” <newline> <newline> Eliza was reluctant to accept Karin ’ s offer . She did not want to drown Karin with her sorrows . Yet , Karin offered her hand once more . They looked at each other for a while . Eliza knew well that her sister felt the same sadness as her . She knew her sister was suffering deep inside , beneath her reassuring grin . But she was here , trying to cheer Eliza up ; as if nothing had happened to her . Karin has always cared too much about Eliza , willing to forgo her own welfare for Eliza . And it pained Eliza to see Karin sacrificing , yet again , just for her sake . <newline> <newline> “ Come on sis , my hand ’ s starting to hurt. ” Karin joked . Eliza finally took it , smiling thinly at her sister . <newline> <newline> * ... * <newline> <newline> The ever-shifting waves of people flowed down the streets of downtown . The cacophony of voices accompanied the dissonance of early morning traffic , resounding together in an orchestra of discord . Eliza held Karin ’ s hand tight as her sister maneuvered her way through the sea of people . <newline> <newline> “ Eliza… ” A familiar voice called out . Eliza stopped abruptly , almost throwing Karin out of balance . <newline> <newline> Karin faced Eliza “ What ’ s wrong ? ” <newline> <newline> Eliza looked around , searching for the source . <newline> <newline> “ Eliza… ” The cold , but sweet woman beckoned once more ; her voice resonating sadness . <newline> <newline> Eliza ran after the voice , hastily cutting through the crowds . Karin swore under her breath and ran after her . Eliza weaved past dozens of people and burst into an abandoned building . The voice cried out again . It seems to be coming from above . Eliza ran up the spiraling flights of stairs , in pursuit of the ominous voice . Karin was still running after her , calling out and trying to stop her in vain . Eliza raced up the stairs , eager to find out if her assumptions were correct . She knew perfectly well that it was impossible . She knew it was all for nothing . But something inside pushes her to go on and continue the pursuit . It was a feeling that she thought she lost the day the tragedy fell upon her . A feeling she let go of when hell was set loose to torment her life . It was an anticipation that all will be better tomorrow . It was hope . <newline> <newline> Eliza reached the rooftop of the abandoned building , and she was blinded by the glare of sunlight . It was unnaturally bright . Harsh white light poured out from the heavens and flooded the mortal world with its brilliance . She disregarded the intense sunshine and continued her pursuit of the phantom voice , shielding her eyes with her flimsy hands . <newline> <newline> “ Wait , Eliza ! ” Karin called out from behind her . She was panting , breathing heavily from racing after her sister . “ What are you doing ? ” <newline> <newline> But Eliza did not listen to her and kept going . It seemed that the light has emptied her mind of all thoughts and sense . Her mind was devoid of everything but of her pursuit for the voice . She walked blindly onward . A hand suddenly reached out and tried to hold her back . The disembodied hand had an iron grip , fastening tightly around Eliza ’ s wrist . It was forcing her to stay . Eliza wrestled with all her might . Eventually , she freed herself from its grasp and she continued following the voice . The glare suddenly subsided and the surroundings got more visible . A vast expanse of blue sky dotted by cotton-like clouds surrounded her . A gentle breeze brought fresh air from the nearby forest . <newline> <newline> “ No ! Eliza , stop ! ” Karin called out , but it was already too late . <newline> <newline> The resounding crackle of weak concrete filled the air . Time seemed to slow down as Karin ran towards Eliza , in a hopeless effort to save her . The aged concrete roof failed to support Eliza ’ s weight and gave in , sending her hurtling down with a loud shriek . <newline> <newline> * ... * <newline> <newline> Eliza landed with a sickening crunch and was jolted awake by the pain of the impact . The abandoned building slowly dissolved into darkness . Eliza sat up , confounded by all the strange events . Was that a dream ? She blindly reached out to the dark void . Her hand brushed cold metal and she recoiled in shock . Where am I ? She wondered . <newline> <newline> “ Careful , you blithering idiot ! ” The infuriated voice of a man spoke from out of the darkness . “ This girl ’ s worth more than your pathetic life ! ” There was a shuffle of footsteps followed by unintelligible chatter . <newline> <newline> “ Step aside , twit. ” The man said ; annoyance entangled with every word that escaped his breath . <newline> <newline> Eliza retreated further to the darkness . Her bare back suddenly made contact with cold metal , and she jumped in surprise , ending up colliding with even more metal above her . She started to panic . Her heart beat faster and faster . She pulled her legs up to her chest and curled up in a corner . Bright light filtered in as the cover was parted . It took time before Eliza ’ s eyes could adjust to the brightness of the room . The first thing she saw was the fuzzy figure of a man . He peered through behind pillars of black . He was surrounded by a halo of brilliance . The man held his hand through the pillars and reached out for Eliza . She shut her eyes , whimpering in fear . The man ’ s hand gently combed her hair . Eliza started trembling . Her eyes glued shut , tears slowly trickling down her cheeks . As strangely gentle as his touch , the man spoke to Eliza . <newline> <newline> “ You have no idea how much trouble you put us into , little girl . ”

2,"Not a native speaker , but here goes : ) Thanks for the awesome WP idea ! <newline> <newline> Chapter 1 <newline> <newline> One more moment , that ’ s all she was asking for . One more moment in the warmth of the car , the comfort of the seat . One more moment of peace , before she would step pout into the cold streets of New York to witness yet another example of the cruelties a human being is capable of . <newline> <newline> Maybe we are not so different from animals after all , she thought as she looked through the foggy windshield , watching police offers trying to hold off the crowd that had already built around the yellow police tape . Like vultures , they were eager to just catch a glimpse of the lifeless body , fighting each other for the best viewing spots . Just by looking at them , their combined breath building a big white cloud of warm air , she could feel the hair on her arms rising . Slowly , the cold found its way into the interior of the car , creeping through every possible opening and conquering this once cozy resort . She buttoned up her coat and , with a deep sigh , opened the door to step outside . It wasn ’ t the cold that hit her , but the strong winds , piercing against her face like countless needles . Winter had hit early this year , and strong ! The number of people who had frozen to death was already in the double figures and if the met boys were right , it would keep rising during the holidays . But she wasn ’ t called because a poor homeless guy didn ’ t make it through the night , her presence meant something worse : Someone had taken another person ’ s life and it was up to her to catch the killer and bring him to justice . <newline> <newline> As she moved towards the cordon , the crowd ’ s attention shifted to her . They all had noticed her arrival simultaneously like one single organism , now yelling and stretching out their voice recorders just to get one piece of information , one statement , one sentence , just something they could use for their news report . She heard them call her name many times , but she didn ’ t intend to feed the vultures and walked right past them . There was nothing she could have told them anyway , given that she just had arrived on the scene . A brawny officer in his thirties lifted cordon and greeted her with a nod as he saw her squeezing through the crowd . <newline> <newline> “ The body ’ s right around the corner , Detective . They are already waiting for you. ” <newline> <newline> She didn ’ t say anything , just thanked him with a little nod and smile . It had begun snowing an hour ago , but she could still see several footprints leading into the alley . Witnesses , police offers , detectives , the medical examiner , they all had already walked this narrow path leading to a crime victim . There was no way of distinguishing or identifying any of them as they all crossed each other multiple times , leaving behind a wild chaos on the white ground . As she entered the alley , adding yet another layer of footprints , she noticed the garbage containers that hadn ’ t been emptied for at least a week and for once she was glad about the sub-zero temperatures , imagining how horrible this alley must have smelled a few months ago , exposed to the heat of summer . The intense winter presented the garbage collection with a problem and the restaurant on her right had no other choice than to just keep piling up their waste . For a homeless person , this was probably the closest thing to heaven on earth right now : Cooked meals that had been returned by unsatisfied customers , fresh ingredients that had simply fallen to the floor , leftovers that nobody wanted to eat , expired food – add a marrow or some other kind of improved bad and one could survive here for quite some time . <newline> <newline> She reached the corner leading to the backyard of the adjoining buildings and almost bumped into a tall , skinny guy with a camera , documenting the crime scene for later analysis . <newline> <newline> “ Detective Reed , nice of you to finally join our little party . You know , it ’ s not exactly Hawaii out here. ” <newline> <newline> People briefly darted a look at her and continued their work , only John Graham , the medical examiner , and her partner Charley McKay rose up from the body to greet her . McKay was one of the oldest detectives in the homicide department and just a few years away from retirement . The two of them never really warmed up to each other and she knew from the beginning that he wasn ’ t really excited when she joined Homicide and got partnered up with him . <newline> <newline> “ Jesus , Reed , where have you been ? ! I ’ m freezing my ass off here , it ’ s freaking cold ! ” <newline> <newline> She ignored her partner ’ s moaning and focused her attention on Dr. Graham . <newline> <newline> “ I noticed . What have we got here ? ” <newline> “ Young , white female . I ’ d say not older than 25 years . She was found this morning , lying here on her back. ” <newline> <newline> Reed took a good look at the victim who was not much younger than herself . That could ’ ve been me , was the first thing she thought . She scanned the body from head to toe , sucking in every little detail : The long , blonde hair that was tucked in neatly into the woolen cap , the pale skin and the little mole on her right cheek , the innocent look , the fancy silk dress underneath the coat , the long legs – she was definitely one of those girls that could turn a man ’ s world upside-down with just one look . Although Reed was content with her life , she always envied those girls . Girls who could show their feminine site with pride and didn ’ t have to fight for respect every day , always wearing an armor of professionalism to survive in a world full of testosterone . But with this girl , there was nothing to be envy about anymore . She had been killed and left in an alley , like the garbage dumped here by the restaurant ’ s kitchen staff . Who are you and why were you here ? <newline> <newline> “ Do we have an ID ? ” <newline> “ No , CSU is searching the nearby dumpsters , but they haven ’ t found anything yet . There ’ s this purse here , but there ’ s nothing inside to identify her. ” <newline> <newline> So now she was not only dead , but also nameless – what a terrible way to bite the dust . Again , Reed looked at the victim ’ s face and noticed the choke marks around her neck . <newline> <newline> “ What ’ s the cause of death ? ” <newline> “ Well , we ’ ve got a blunt force trauma to the back of her head , but that ’ s not what killed her. ” He turned her head to show the injury for a few seconds , and then continued : “ You see those marks on her neck ? They suggest that the killer used his bare hands to choke her to death . Based on the snow on top of her , the lividity and her internal temperature , I ’ d say it happened sometime between 1 and 3 am this morning. ” <newline> <newline> A movie started playing in her mind , showing the likely story of this Jane Doe ’ s last minutes . She is probably on her way home from a party , a little intoxicated , but she still knows where she is going . Maybe she is only a few minutes away from her apartment or maybe she ’ s using this alley as a shortcut . As she staggers along , still thinking of the fun she had a few hours ago , she doesn ’ t notice the dark shape behind her , hiding in the shades . She hears some steps behind her , but it ’ s too late . Disorientated , she drops to the floor . AS her attacker positions himself above her , she starts to feel the pain on the back of her head . Slowly and full of fear , she turns around to face him . With one swift move , he grabs her throat and squeezes . She tries to loosen the grip , but he ’ s too strong and her strength is fading with every second . AS a last resort , she tries to scream , but only a weak squeak leaves her mouth . Slowly , her vision blackens , until she can barely see him . Her head feels like a feather and her body seems to be floating away . He keeps squeezing for a few more moments , then he stands up , looking down on what he has done . Cold , without remorse , he walks away and vanishes in the darkness he came from .

2,"Bob was your standard American nobody , an average schmuk with a high school degree , a few college classes under his belt and an unskilled job he ’ d go do day in and day out . There really wasn ’ t anything that made Bob stand out . He was short , a little chubby and freckled faced . He looked a little odd thanks to a mixed heritage of Hispanic and Irish . He liked to describe himself as an American mutt . Which wasn ’ t exactly accurate since he never really bothered to search his lineage on his mother ’ s side , he just decided that American mutt was a pretty good catch all and saved him time . <newline> <newline> Well there was one thing about Bob that made him a little more important than most of the people on that floating spaceship his race called Earth . Around his late twenties Bob developed tinnitus . It was a constant buzzing noise in his ears . He noticed it one night when he fell asleep on a friends couch . He remembered thinking that his friend really needed to do something about those locusts . It wasn ’ t locusts . It wasn ’ t until well into Bob ’ s 38th year of life that he found out what it really was . Also , it wasn ’ t tinnitus . <newline> <newline> For about the last 60 years or so humans have been broadcasting all sorts of crap into the great beyond . They ’ ve sent radio waves , television waves , satellites with vinyl and all sorts of other things in an effort to make contact with alien civilizations . Now humans are a fairly arrogant bunch . They pretty much believed that by sending these signals out we could find alien life and they would respond in kind with similar signals . It didn ’ t quite go down that way . The aliens got the signals but it was really hard for them to decipher at first . Now imagine you ’ re a member of this great galaxies spanning civilization with communication that transcends the speed of light and general consciousness . <newline> <newline> Now imagine you find this planet with sentient life is trying to communicate and their only method of communication is only auditory and visual . To put it into perspective it would be like answering a text message on your phone and then instead of words your phone started giving out smoke signals , in Latin . <newline> <newline> Well the aliens did respond . They were excited . This place called Earth was making baby steps toward joining the galaxy . So the aliens did their best to respond in their most base technology . They called it a cerebral connection . It was direct communication to the nerve cluster that allows for communication in a creature ’ s ear . No needs to fill up all the air with those needless sounds , just simple communication from one person to another via vibrations . The Aliens were proud of their idea and sent their message . <newline> <newline> “ People of Earth , we welcome you to the great galactic civilization . We have heard your calls and like to greet you in peace and honor . We are looking forward to an exchange of ideas “ <newline> <newline> Unfortunately the translation matrix didn ’ t work all that well in humans . It ended up sounding like a bunch of locusts having a field day on a farm in Mississippi . The aliens tried again and again and again to communicate . It never worked so they finally said fuck it and started kidnapping people . <newline> This is where Bob comes in . <newline> <newline> There was nothing really special about the start of Bob ’ s week that week . He woke up , took his shower , got dressed , drank a cup of coffee , surfed the web for recent news , chuckled at some webcomics and headed to work . He did his normal eight hour tour of duty in customer service support and went home . After a couple of beers he was fast asleep on his couch . He called that Monday . Tuesday morning ended up being a little different . <newline> <newline> <newline> Psychotic break was what Bob decided to go with . It was really the only thing that came close to explaining what he was experiencing and as far as psychotic breaks went it was pretty good . The bed he woke up in was enormous and extremely comfortable , the massive flat screen television was showing last year ’ s Superbowl and there was a nice gentle breeze in the room . <newline> <newline> However the naked midget in the full body condom really confused the hell out of him as did the floating `` : ) '' that hovered just above his bed . The midget stood just off to the side of the bed staring eagerly in Bob 's direction . <newline> <newline> `` What in the fuuuu '' Bob started to say but then he went silent when the : ) started to talk . Then the left parenthesis or in this case the mouth started moving and out came letters that eventually formed words that also just hovered in the air . <newline> <newline> : ) Please do not be alarmed Bob of Earth of America of Kansas of Topeka of 3200 Frost Rd # 2 . We only wish to have an exchange of dialogue with you . We hope that everything is to your comfort level . We have factored your cultural , leisure , sexual and subsistence needs <newline> <newline> Bob sat up in the bed and looked closely at the midget then back to the floating emoticon and his mind made a quick self-diagnosis . <newline> <newline> Explanation : Psychotic Break <newline> Reason : Way to many fucking hours surfing 4chan . <newline> Course of Action : What the hell , new reason to call in to work . Let ’ s see what happens . <newline> <newline> The Emoticon floated away towards what looked like a door . <newline> <newline> Bob started to get out of the bed he was laying in when he was stopped by the little guy in the full body condom . It just still looked at him eagerly and oddly . Bob closed his eyes and attempted to will the midget away . The whole psychosis thing was new to him . He was n't quite sure how it was supposed to work . His closest experience with any sort of mental issue was his Uncle Maxwell . Good old uncle Max was pretty normal except for his adamant belief that his pet yorkie was Teddy Roosevelt reincarnated . At family gatherings Max insisted everyone address the dog as Mr President and had once attempted to get Secret Service to secure a lifetime supply of puppy chow . <newline> <newline> Bob opened his eyes and the midget was still there . It started climbing onto the bed towards him . Bob quickly put his foot out holding the little guy away . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Emo ! Little floatly thingy . You with the words ! Little help here ! '' <newline> <newline> = ( Does it not please you ? We researched your information archival machine for images that would be suitable for your morning reproductive needs . <newline> <newline> `` Informational what ? Waitwaitwait ! You mean my computer ? '' Bob said still kicking at the midget in the full body condom <newline> <newline> : D Yes computer . <newline> <newline> If Bob 's subconscious had been a person Bob would have kicked it right in the nuts as hard as he could . Out of everything he had ever seen while surfing the internet his psychotic break decided to go with gay midget porn for sexual gratification . <newline> <newline> `` Seriously ! You could n't have gone with Olivia Wilde in her Tron suit or a random anime cosplay . . . WHOA ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> The little person that was struggling to get onto the bed was suddenly transformed into ample breasted woman in medieval armor wielding a very large broadsword . Normally this would have hit on everyone one of Bob 's sexual fantasy criteria except this particular attractive badass was very animated , as in a cartoon . <newline> <newline> Bob blinked a few times . <newline> <newline> `` You know for representation of my insanity Emo , you really suck at this . This one is an improvement but , one more time . Lets try again . Think a little less sailor moon and a little more real life femshep '' <newline> <newline> The warrior woman vanished from the room completely . <newline> <newline> : \ Bob of Earth of America of Kansas of Topeka of 3200 Frost Rd # 2 . You are not insane . <newline> <newline> The whole floor of room suddenly vanished and Bob found himself looking at what he was fairly certain was Europe . Only from about 100 miles up . <newline> <newline> It took a few seconds for the impact of what he was seeing to sink in and when his brain finally allowed for coherent thought and speech Bob simply said <newline> <newline> `` Wow '' <newline>

2,"Well , I 'm really late to the party but I hope i get plenty of people reading this ( I realyl wo n't will I ) <newline> _____________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> He was told to draw occult lines , to scribble down little runes into the ground , to carve strange symbols into the tree trunks while the harsh sea winds nipped at his full , red cheeks . Such was cruel work to the soft little hands possessed by a small , fair face – that could have been called nothing but beautiful – and yet in those fledgling eyes there was a spark and in those little steps there was a skip . For little Abraham had been promised something out of all the hard work , something he had never had or dreamt of having before . <newline> <newline> And that something was more than enough for him to toil and work under the stern gaze of a general who the entire nation worshipped as a war hero – but he ’ d already grown used to the general being around . As far as he could remember ( which wasn ’ t very far at all ) the general had always been there , rubbing shoulders with his father , even kneeling before him at times . Yet as little Abraham plodded from trunk to trunk , his hands callused from holding a carving knife and his feet full of blisters , he still wondered why would anyone kneel before his father ? It seemed like an odd practice , the closest he had ever come to it was when went up to the father ’ s legs and hugged them – his head barely reaching the thigh of the towering figure . <newline> <newline> But those were better days … Now he barely remembered the visage of his father , not that he particularly remembered much these days other than his little rattle and the daily training inflicted onto him by the aforementioned general . To an eight year old , a father of whom the only memory he has is hugging a muscular leg that barely paused before it started moving again not being there is hardly anything at all , especially when a the general was there , who although stern and harsh when it came to training did still pick him up and throw him towards the stratosphere – laughing joyously as he caught him on the way down . The child didn ’ t really see the need to have a father , and really all that was truly on his mind right now was his work as he whispered words that had been taught and taught and taught once again to him in order to burn them onto his mind . <newline> His uncle did try to teach him the meaning of the words but what does a little boy care about spirits and immortals and all the other big words that he used . The general ’ s teachings really were wasted on him , but as he looked out towards the little boy skipping from trunk to trunk , drawing out all the circles and pentagrams in a rush , chanting age old runes passed down through centuries of tradition the corners of his mouth turned up as his always stern eyes allowed a hint of affection to enter them . His nephew really was brimming with anticipation , and after all a promise like this was something to be excited about . <newline> <newline> Stroking the bark of a tree , Abraham twirled his fingers rhythmically , allowing himself a deep breath which he held until he felt a heat accumulating underneath his fingers and little flames dancing at the palm of his hand – licking rough corrugated surface of the bark , charring it slowly until those very fingers that summoned it curled into a tight ball causing it to vanish . The same tight ball found itself hurtled towards the now charred and blackened husk with all the might it could muster . Upon impact a tear welled up in the little one ’ s eyes as he fell on his bottom , his wailing bringing a day dreaming uncle back to attention as he rushed over to the tiny figure – now collapsed on the ground , nursing a bruised fist – concerned about the boy ’ s well-being . <newline> <newline> “ Oh Abraham , what have I told you about the sprite magic ? One must not be in such a rush , especially when you have such a frail body . You mustn ’ t hurt it ” , said the general as he bent down to sit down next to the boy , picking him up onto his lap and letting out a groan as a crack escaped his ages knees in the process . Placing his lips on the crying Abraham ’ s forehead he smiled and started weaving fingers on top of the knuckles , taking the heat away from the wound . Never ceasing to speak to the child while he distracted him from the pain , he jabbed a point with a practiced finger , numbing the child ’ s hand before burning the wound in the same way that the tree ’ s skin was burnt away to prevent infection . “ For did not the great poet Ayezaf not tell you <newline> <newline> *Oh you who rushes and fret* <newline> <newline> *Oh you who burns what he must destroy* <newline> <newline> *The hand shall be consumed by that very pet* <newline> <newline> *So please heed my warning , little royal boy ” * <newline> <newline> His pain gone along with the control of his hand , Abraham looked up at the uncle – his tears now at being scolded rather than at the pain – and replied in a tearing voice as he remembered the verses his teacher had once told him when as now he had ended up scalding his hand in his lessons “ But uncle I can ’ t wait ! It needs to be quicker ! Why did the spirits have to make this so hard… It ’ s so much work … Why can ’ t they just send him to me without all of this… ” <newline> <newline> Laughing at the child ’ s speech – now slurred with a series of hiccups and sobs - and playing with his hair the uncle brought his lips down to the boy ’ s ear and whispered , “ How about the next time I go to the realm of the sprites , I take you with me and then you can ask them yourself ? ” <newline> <newline> Eyes twinkling and head spinning while fantasizing about the land of the sprites that he had read so much about in the story books that his teachers showed to him about his father , “ The Great Conquerer ” , Abraham barely let a gasp escape him as a sharp jab brought feeling back into his arm . He really did like the pictures , the fire sprites seemed so lively and fun with festivals and dances and toys and oh the lovely lovely cakes that they supposedly made . All those stories that his uncle told him , although he often wondered why such a dark look came into his uncle ’ s generally accepting eyes when recounting such fantastical tales . <newline> He was brought back to his senses with the sound of a gentle voice saying “ Ah but Abraham … You shall come to learn , that if there is anything worth having , then it is going to come with more than just prayers to the sprites , smiles and adorable little eight year old faces… It takes more hard work than you could ever imagine ! Do you not think what you ’ re doing is worth the hard work ? ” <newline> <newline> Leaping off of the uncle ’ s lap Abraham started apologizing frantically “ No , no , no uncle please ! I-I ’ m so sorry ! Please , please , please uncle all the work in the world is worth this I ’ ll do anything for this I ’ ve read so much about them please please uncle let me make one – “ <newline> <newline> His eyes brimming with tears the general pulled the child into his arms to comfort him and to hide his own weakness as he gazed at the child so pityingly , thinking to himself that no child should have to go through all this trouble to get what you are . I pity you who is willing to go so far for a luxury most of us take for granted , I will always stand by your side Abraham . Always . <newline> <newline> Still thinking that his uncle was reprimanding him the child continued his frantic appeal “ - please uncle please ! Don ’ t make me stop ! I need this ! Please don ’ t make me stop the summoning ! – “ <newline> <newline> And then the one sentence , which truly broke the general ’ s soul… <newline> <newline> “ - Please let me create a friend ! It ’ ll be my only one I promise ! ” <newline>

2,"The stout old man swept the gathering sweat away from his forehead and prodigious eyebrows and straightened his back with a creak , though it made little difference in his stature as he stood just over five feet tall and slightly less every year . Looking over the plowed field , with turned loam the same color as his dusky skin he gazed out into the gathering twilight . He started gathered his tools and began to turn toward homeward for the night when movement caught the corner of his eye . At the edge of the field he could just barely make out black shapes against the darkness coming from over a low hill . His heart quickened and he turned and ran , a strangled cry escaping from his lips as the shapes revealed themselves as dozens upon dozens of short , lizard-like forms running quickly and quietly . He barely made it half a dozen steps before he felt a giant slap and pitched forward into the newly plowed field , half a dozen arrows sprouting from his back like newly budded wheat . <newline> <newline> The battle ended with Solokar the winner as usual . He was taller than most of the other boys in the village , and had greater reach with the thick branches they used when playing warrior . Finally his assailant dropped his weapon and surrendered , then gave Solokar a mock bow and a grin . “ I almost had you that time , ” his friend Arankil announced smiling . “ We ’ d better head back though before your da ’ has both our backsides for stayin ' out so late. ” The young teens gathered up the baskets that they had used to stash the billowberries they had been picking and headed back toward town . Along the way they sang heroic ballads overheard at the Hearthwood , Toorville ’ s only inn , on the rare occasion that a minstrel would wander through on their way to a larger town . <newline> <newline> As they neared the village in the early evening , however , the songs quickly faltered and died upon their tongues . Taking a shortcut through old Stevarain ’ s field they came upon his corpse , lying motionless in the dirt . After the initial shock , Solokar checked for the signs of life as his dad had taught him , though in his heart he already knew the truth . The boys scrambled away from the body and ran toward home , sobs replacing ballads as they raced for their families . No succor was found when they reached the village , however as what they found there was even more dreadful . The entire village was destroyed , bodies laying in unnatural angles and pools of blood black in the darkness . Not a soul was stirring in the gathering night . After a few minutes searching in shock a new threat presented . Fires left burning in several of the grass thatched buildings caught and spread , filling the air with choking smoke . Finally the boys could stay no longer and they scrambled out of the village , crying and hugging each other as they ran from the gathering flames . <newline> <newline> With no thought to direction or destination the boys ran down the south-bound road , their sobs turning to screams as they found their voices in the destruction . Stumbling through the darkness on the main road with a flickering red glow at their backs , there was no way to see as they caught up with the rear guard of the small army that had just demolished their town . The woeful boys gave early alarm to the creatures , who eagerly fell upon them . <newline> <newline> Seeing that they were unarmed and no danger to them , the lizard creatures quickly grappled the youths . Red eyes burned from the darkness as they grunted and hissed an unfamiliar language . After a short time of this the boys were quickly trussed up in tight hemp ropes , gagged and thrown into the back of a straw-lined wagon purloined from the village . The boys shook in shock as their world crashed around them . For hours and hours they rode in the bouncing wagon , unable to move . Finally the sky began to brighten and the wagon slowed to a stop . <newline> <newline> Five of the scaly , lizard-like creatures approached the wagon , hissing and screeching to each other . Solokar and Arankil were roughly pulled out and dumped unceremoniously on the ground , then retied to a nearby tree as the creatures made a camp for the day . Large tarps were readied and stood up as lean-to ’ s , blocking the morning sun . Small cook fires were started and hare , dog , and other unidentifiable meat set to roasting . After the monsters finished their breakfast , one of them forced a bit of water on the boys soaking through the gags in their mouth and then settled down to rest . <newline> <newline> This routine was then repeated , night in and out . After the second night the boys were made to walk , with longer ropes allowing short steps but not long strides . After a week they were put to work , scrubbing pots , mending clothing and carrying loads , directed by grunts and gesture . They were made to wait , tied to a tree , as the monsters razed two other villages similar to their home . In the third month , Arankil was once slow to get out of the way of a particularly mean looking lizard , who opened up his throat with a wicked looking blade for the perceived insult . <newline> <newline> Seasons passed . Solokar grew to understand some of the language of his captors , though he wished he didn ’ t as most of their discussions revolved around fighting , eating , or mating , and comments to him were limited to insults or commands . He was treated as a slave , and grew numb to the world . For almost two years he lived in the village of the lizard monsters , in the foothills far to the south of his home . <newline> <newline> Then one day Solokar got a chance for release . The lizards , who called themselves kobolds , grew lax and left him to work the smithy in the village alone . the smithy was a medium-sized stone building where Solokar ’ s job was to work the billows and feed wood to maintain the roaring fire , as well as melt ingots of metal into rods that the kobolds would later work into rough swords . Not able to cope any longer , Solokar gathered all of the wood , straw and other combustible material together and lit all of it on fire . The fire spread quickly , the searing heat and flames consuming the fuel and spreading throughout the building . The flames licked at him , burning his body and setting his hair smoldering . Solokar said a quick prayer to Ilmater , his father ’ s deity , asking him to forgive him for taking his own life in despair . <newline> <newline> Before the flames could fully take Solokar , however , the door burst open and in rushed a large group of kobolds with buckets of water which they quickly began dumping on the flames . For some reason they did not seem to be scared of the flames , and went directly to work quenching the fire . Through his pain wracked brain Solokar caught a moment of lucidity from his madness and noticed the open , unguarded door . <newline> <newline> Solokar stumbled out to find the town in confusion . The creatures were running around trying to gather more buckets , snarling and hissing at each other while working to control the conflagration . Solokar stumbled away , pain lancing through his body . He managed to make his way out of the town and , somehow , found his way to a small stream that ran near to the village , that he fell into in an effort to quiet the screaming pain . After a time shock took hold and he felt no more pain as he slipped into unconsciousness . <newline> <newline> The morning broke bright to find Solokar still alive . Through the haze of pain he looked down into his reflection in the water and saw himself , half his face and neck terribly burned but otherwise whole . Gathering his energy , Solokar used some of the skills his father had taught him as a child in identifying plants to find a reed near the stream that would ease his pain . The billowberries that he later found to sate his hunger brought another kind of pain from his memory . He worked his way north away from the village of the kobolds and into a new life . <newline> <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> Edit : Formatting

2,"“ No ! ” She screamed pleadingly as her husband ripped the child from her arms . “ He ’ s too young ! ” <newline> <newline> “ You should have thought of that before spreading your legs like a whore ! ” He spat at her , striking her hard across the face with one arm as he precariously held the child in the other , casually swinging it about like refuse . <newline> <newline> It was always the same . An abortion here . A cheating wife here . A secret birth there . Genealogy records . All of them came to me with their petty requests . And of course , like today , there was the god damn leeching ritual . <newline> <newline> “ Hand it to me. ” I said . I kept all emotion from my voice . That was important . Never give either the husband or the wife a single hint of comfort or malice . Never let either of them know who you would side with if you knew them . For that matter , don ’ t get close to the village you ’ re assigned to . <newline> <newline> I avoided flinching as the child was thrust head first into my arms , and kept back a curl of disdain as the couple entered into a bickering argument . I focused on the child . I had helped with the birth a mere week ago . By all rights though , the boy would die today , due to a ritual he wasn ’ t old enough to undergo let alone understand . He would die simply because his father suspected his mother of cheating on him and passing off another man ’ s bastard under his roof . <newline> <newline> He was right of course , but that was in no way the boy ’ s fault . <newline> <newline> I reached out to grab the man ’ s arm for his portion of the leeching . The fact that doing so stopped him from striking his cowing wife , still weak and whimpering from her birthing not eight days prior provided a perk of satisfaction . “ Your arm is needed. ” I said flatly . <newline> <newline> I did my best to ignore the sobs of the woman on my floor or the wincing pain the man expressed as I drew a trickle of blood from him . Leeching required absolute concentration . After the smallest cut I applied the great leech to his wound . The creature was half as large as the child on the table next to it , and it would need to be generously fed if the child was to have a fraction of a chance at survival . <newline> <newline> The leech was a wonder to behold . Purple on green on magenta , then blue on orange , it shifted colors as it drank deep of the man ’ s living essence . Better seers than me could read the signs of the blood this way , but I was a mere hedge witch , not a full Sister of Jakkar . I let these country hicks think they had a competent seer of the blood among them . After all , I was more than they deserved . <newline> <newline> But this tiny life in front of me deserved better than me , and better than the parents who brought him to my door . Better than the man who would endanger a child , better than a mother who would rob her son of his patrilineage , and better than the fumbling youth she allowed into her bed while her husband conducted his trade . <newline> <newline> So of course I let the damn leech have its fill . <newline> <newline> Then came that critical moment , the moment I dreaded every time . I had to take the knife , a knife long and brutish enough to cut the child cleanly in half , and slice open a cut enough to give the leech unrestricted access to the babe . The heel was my location of choice , and as always I muttered a silent prayer to whatever god or goddess was watching to not let the child bleed out . <newline> <newline> I pried the leech off the man and redirected it to the screaming babe ’ s open leg , and grimaced as the creature contorted and thrust itself obscenely , ready to gorge on the blood of an innocent child . It had only one instinct : to feed . I have seen fat men , and none have ever embodied gluttony like one of my leeches . If I did not perform my part accurately and quickly , the child would become a withered husk and my leech would burst overflowing . It would not be the first time one of my leeches hemorrhaged to death , and embarrassingly not the first time on my watch . <newline> <newline> I gripped the leech by the back of its thoracic glands , where it formed the mucus that lined its lamprey like teeth . Massaging there I caused it to constrict and digest , reminding the creature that it was already full . <newline> <newline> “ What is happening ? Is my son alive ? ” The mother pleaded on my floor . <newline> <newline> “ Quiet . Or he won ’ t live much longer . Pray if that helps you. ” I kept my words harsh but calm , sparing less than a glance towards the father ’ s face . He seemed to care more about the wound on his arm than the fact that a blood sucking monster was writhingly attached to a small child in front of him . “ This requires absolute concentration. ” <newline> <newline> This was also barbaric . <newline> <newline> I ignored the whimpering on my floor , the screams of fear and death from the tiny babe on my table , and the cold gaze of the man over my shoulder , and worked . I worked my fingers over the slimy surface of my leech , and clenched my jaw so hard I could taste blood . Already I could see the creature regurgitate , sending blood into the wound in front of it . This was but one of many secrets my leeches held . But it was among the most impressive . <newline> <newline> The finger motions were complicated , but I allowed nothing to distract me . It was the finest work I had ever done . The leech expelled the father ’ s blood deep into the child , mixing it with the child ’ s blood both in the child and in the leech , before linking it ’ s feeding into the rhythm of the infant ’ s own heartbeat . <newline> <newline> Pumping , it began to swallow and expel , swallow and expel . And each time it did , the blood would mingle and digest , mingle and digest . If it were a normal leech the acid would contaminate the blood and make it useless , but as I said before my leeches are special . <newline> <newline> The child ’ s skin grew yellow and then grey in section across his torso , arms , and face , and then down his legs until every part of his little body looked beaten and bruised . I knew then it was time to halt the leech with a spray of salt , and used a small heated iron to close the wound once the mouth had been pried free . <newline> <newline> I cradled the poor babe into my arms , my tired old withered arms . “ Come back to us little one . Open your eyes again a new man ’ s son . Come bad to old Esar , and I ’ ll be sure to give you a fine name . You ’ d like that , wouldn ’ t you ? ” <newline> <newline> I had never coaxed one of my patients this way , but then again I had never been asked to use a leech on anyone so young before . All of this abuse , just to trade the seed of one man for the blood of another , and all before the poor boy could even know anything of the world beyond the feel of his mother ’ s tit . Our world is cruel , and it didn ’ t strike me how cruel it was until I held this tiny boy in my arms and truly felt the weight of my years on me by inflicting so much on a child new to the world . The world is cruel , but only because we the old do so much to the young . <newline> <newline> We make the world this way , and we teach our children to just keep making it . I hope this boy learns well . Oh gods above please let him live . <newline> <newline>

2,"9 Stations <newline> <newline> <newline> “ Come on in , Strunk. ” <newline> <newline> The door opened and in stepped two officers in their full regalia . I was only expecting one - Chief Strunk never had company before - and I ’ d assumed he ’ d lost his uniform ages ago , he wears it so rarely . As they shut the door behind them , I noticed that a third remained in the hallway . <newline> <newline> I motioned to the chairs in front of my desk . “ What ’ s the trouble , folks ? ” Strunk removed his cap and took a seat , while his accomplice remained standing . Ex-security . Some of the brighter guards get chosen to be retrained , but most wash out and end up right back where they came from , standing in front of a door all day . This must be somebody ’ s kid . The back door is the only way into ECE if you don ’ t have good enough test scores . <newline> <newline> “ ChiangCorp is farther along than we thought , ” said the familiar , tired voice of the division head . <newline> <newline> “ Good for them. ” <newline> <newline> The second officer glared through my eyes and tossed a file on my desk . “ Our source told us just a week ago that they were at least a year away from completing a prototype . This morning , we learned that they already had one , and it ’ s just 6 months out from mass production. ” <newline> <newline> “ And you ’ re already looking for a witness ? ” <newline> <newline> He waited until I looked back up from the folder at him . “ We need to get this straightened out - as soon as possible . You head out this evening. ” <newline> <newline> “ Are you sure your intel is good ? ” <newline> <newline> “ No. ” The chief tugged uncomfortably at his collar . “ Frankly , we ’ re not sure of anything . They could be feeding our ghouls bad info , this new leak could be bad intel… Hell , our ghouls could be their ghouls . I ’ d go ahead and plan on nine jumps . It ’ s a real fucking mess. ” <newline> <newline> “ And I ’ m the lucky guy who gets to straighten it out. ” <newline> <newline> Bad Cop piped up , almost quick enough to interrupt . “ That ’ s your job , isn ’ t it ? ” <newline> <newline> The chief pulled himself out of the chair with a slight grunt and pulled the waist of his coat down . “ Just find out everything you can . We ’ ll do what we can back here . If we learn anything new before you jump , we ’ ll get it to you. ” He opened the door and motioned the other officer through while looking back at me . “ Stay sharp and good luck. ” <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> Ghouls are every department head ’ s biggest fear . They ’ re double agents . They spend all day working at your business . When they clock out , they go work a graveyard shift telling somebody else everything you ’ re up to . You end up essentially paying them to spy on you . <newline> <newline> My dad was a big sports fan . He remembered the day they played the last baseball game . October 6th , 2051 . “ They didn ’ t even bother to wait til after the Series , ” he ’ d say . It wasn ’ t a big deal to most people by that time , but apparently the Series used to matter . Dad told me about a whole team back in the early days that were all ghouls for some gamblers . They got caught , and nobody forgave them , but everybody kinda understood . Players made peanuts back then , and the owners got fat off of them . Can you blame a guy for trying to get a share , fair or not ? <newline> <newline> I remember the story because it was how dad came up with his solution to the ghoul problem . See , he always believed that knowing the past was helpful in predicting the future . History is full of data , and with some knowledge of statistics and psychology , that data can be used to predict whether or not a guy will , for example , hit a home run , win an election , or cheat on his wife . His solution to the ghouls was based on something they tried way back with that baseball team . If you pay your people more , then they won ’ t need to go looking for another paycheck . The bosses thought about trying it out , but their advisors warned them about the immense cost of even just trying something . So instead , the bosses paid the advisers to analyze it . Quite a while later , they delivered their conclusions . <newline> <newline> There are three types of workers , they decided - those that will never sell you out , those that will sell you out for very little , and the in-betweeners who could be convinced to sell you out if the bonus they received was greater than x percent of their income . If you raise wages , then the in-betweeners will stay loyal . There will always be some employees , though , who will accept that second paycheck to spy on you . If the in-betweeners stay loyal , the supply of potential spies decreases dramatically , thereby increasing the amount of money that the sell-out employees can demand . As these sell-out bonuses increase , more and more in-betweeners turn into sellouts . It reaches an equilibrium eventually . The end results of the wage increase experiment would be the following : 1 ) you will pay a lot of honest men extra money for no reason ; 2 ) you will successfully bribe a few in-betweeners into staying loyal ; and 3 ) you increase the base wages and the sell-out bonuses for disloyal employees . The company would make less money while the most disloyal employees benefited from an increase in both of their revenue streams . <newline> <newline> And that was that . Rather than waste the money on wages , they invested it in counter-espionage efforts . More walls , more bars , more guards . “ Information gathering ” had previously been a task for the Marketing Department , but the increased influence and authority led to it becoming its own department . The advisers had saved the day , and my dad was removed from the board . A particularly sardonic rival recommended that he be transferred to the newly-created Espionage and Counter-Espionage Department . I was pretty much raised in the ECE . <newline> <newline> That doesn ’ t mean I didn ’ t earn my way in . Great marks all through pre-sorting , good test scores - mental , physical , and psychological - and I displayed a “ finely-tuned situational awareness , ” according to my trainer . The only strike against me was my father ’ s reassignment . At my final assessment , a counsellor suggested that I possibly “ lacked faith in the goodness of our operation. ” He recommended that I was too great a risk to be allowed to join the ECE . My trainer tried to speak up in my defense , but was cut off by the head recruiter . <newline> <newline> “ He can defend himself from that charge , ” she said . “ Well ? Speak. ” <newline> <newline> “ The normal punishment for attempted sabotage of profits these days is either reassignment to the Production Department or a pink slip . My father was instead given an important role in a newly-created and essential department . He repaid the mercy that he was shown with nearly two decades of loyal service. ” I now looked directly at my doubter . “ His commitment can not be questioned . It would dishonor his memory if my own commitment were any less than his. ” <newline> <newline> That little speech got me into the department , but that ass counsellor refused to withdraw his concerns . I ’ ve been stuck with a low ceiling ever since . I would ’ ve spent my career getting passed over in any kind of management role , so I went into investigations . The way I figured , this way , at least I ’ d never have to see the people who got those cushy manager jobs .

2,"“ My Lord. ” The sinister voice was heard clearly in the cavernous room , but any echo was absorbed and nulled by the dark , evil atmosphere . <newline> <newline> The figure on the throne shifted uncomfortably . “ Hades . You have something to report ? I don ’ t see you here often. ” <newline> “ Well , my Lord Zeus , I am occupied with running my realm . But yes , I have made the journey to inform you of something. ” <newline> <newline> “ What is it ? ” Zeus leaned forward in his throne . “ Look , if you ’ ve come to ask for help with your gardening again , consider your request denied . Persephone will be there in a couple of months. ” <newline> <newline> Hades lifted his head slowly . His pure golden eyes seemed to eat into Zeus ’ very being . “ No , my Lord , my hydrangeas are growing perfectly well . They simply needed to be planted closer to Tartarus . They like the heat there. ” <newline> <newline> Zeus nodded thoughtfully then cocked his head to one side . “ Isn ’ t gardening at least a little bit shameful for the Lord of the Dead ? ” <newline> <newline> “ If it wasn ’ t for the flowers , my Lord , I would have sunk into despair centuries ago . I didn ’ t ask for my title , as you well remember . It was you , my Lord , who decided to bestow it upon me. ” The last words were imbued with the slightest venom . <newline> <newline> Zeus flicked his hand . “ So what was it you wanted to tell me ? ” <newline> <newline> “ A minor matter , my Lord. ” Hades ’ voice implied it was anything but . He stood , uttered an incantation and the space in front of him opened into a transparent sphere occupying most of the ten-metre space between the figures . It turned black then faded into a scene familiar to Hades . <newline> <newline> It was the Underworld . The Fields of Asphodel , to be precise . A grey haze lingered where the sky should be , and the ground was cracked rock and red earth . Blackened , scorched trees dotted the landscape , and far into the distance stood a stout wall . <newline> <newline> Hades gestured , and the sphere zoomed in on the wall . It was built from the finest black marble , and looked massive in comparison to the tiny figures of Hades ’ skeleton guards dotting its walkway . <newline> <newline> “ You wanted to show me this wall , Hades ? Why ? ” <newline> <newline> “ This wall has stood since before I was Lord of the Dead . Even I do not know its original purpose . But it happens to guard the boundary of Asphodel. ” Hades pointed again . “ Look . Beyond the wall is the Mnemosyne River. ” <newline> <newline> Zeus leaned further forward and squinted into the sphere . “ I don ’ t know much of your Underworld geography , but I ’ m guessing that green island beyond the river is Elysium. ” <newline> <newline> “ Correct , my Lord . Elysium , the land of the heroes . Until days ago , ruled by Kronos , the Titan leader . If I remember rightly , my Lord , he was the god of agriculture . You forgave him after the Titanomachy and gave him into my custody. ” <newline> <newline> Hades looked at Zeus , and saw he was mulling his words over . Hades continued . “ I made him the king of Elysium . I told him to watch over the souls there , nothing more . I dispatched him to Elysium seven hundred years ago , and I ’ ve heard nothing from him since . That ’ s fine by me , he ’ s a thoroughly unlikeable person. ” <newline> <newline> “ There is a ‘ but ’ , isn ’ t there ? You didn ’ t come to complain about how Kronos insulted your lavender bushes. ” Zeus sounded slightly worried . Hades guessed it was because of Kronos ’ evident involvement . <newline> <newline> “ They are hydrangeas , my Lord , and yes , there is a ‘ but ’ . ” Hades bowed imperceptibly then gestured to the sphere . It sped to Elysium , where it centred on a small village with a wharf . There were multiple ships there , ranging from Greek triremes to tall frigates . There were longships pulled up on the beach alongside , and even a World War Two-era destroyer moored in the deeper water of the natural harbour . <newline> <newline> “ I will assume these ships belong to the heroic spirits. ” Zeus seemed to have got over his worry ; he hadn ’ t noticed that Hades was preparing to break the bad news . <newline> <newline> “ Of course , my Lord . But focus your attention here , on the Mnemosyne. ” Hades pointed , the sphere zoomed out and Zeus saw more ships sailing out of the harbour , and coming from other ports along the shore . They joined each other midway through the river and crossed , in a convoy , to the other side . To Asphodel . <newline> <newline> The sphere sped to the part of the wall that the ships were heading to . Hades , head bowed , heard Zeus ’ sharp intake of breath and smiled grimly . He straightened , looked at the sphere , and observed , for the millionth time that morning , the enormous breach in the black marble wall and the tiny ant-like figures pouring off the ships and into Asphodel . <newline> <newline> “ My Lord Zeus , it appears we are at war . ”

2,"You 're never gon na change . <newline> <newline> Yeah , maybe you 'll fix a few things here and there but the essential you is never going to change . You 'll cry less as you get to elementary school , become more understanding as you step into high school , drink more as you enter college , smoke less pot as you leave , and have less sex as you get married , but you 're always going to be you , and no matter how many times you try to change that , time will make sure you stay the same person . <newline> <newline> Now , I 'm not trying to say your future is predetermined , oh god no . I mean , for fuck 's sake , if I believed that some divine forced planned and orchestrated my situation , I would have bit the dust a long time ago . Of course , I never did it , and I never would have . Like I said , you never change , you never will . <newline> <newline> Of all the species in the world we 're the only ones who contemplate `` personal development '' . Do you think a dog spends his time wondering how he can make himself better ? Fuck no , he 's sitting in your living room floor , licking his balls , waiting for you to put the food in the bowl . That 's pretty much how I lived my life during my undergrad and graduate years , that 's pretty much how I ended up doing regular maintenance and inspection every month . <newline> <newline> At least I 'm not a fucking Carny , that 's what I tell myself everyday . I get a nice government salary , nice benefits , sure there 's barely any women where I work , but I never really planned on getting married anyways so that 's okay , it 's not really my choice anyways , if I 'm suppose to get married , it 's going to happen one way or the other . Now I 'm the dog that has to fetch every now and then , and I really have to be careful where I take a piss , there 's not really any time to lick my balls anymore and well , I 'm the one filling up my food bowl now too . I thought it would be more glamorous , and honestly it was at first , twenty years ago back when this whole thing was exciting . <newline> <newline> I needed to learn the machines front and back , that part was actually the easy part , understanding the physics is what really makes shit weird . Speaking completely honestly here ( since I 'm pretty sure you or I ca n't do anything that will get me fired at this point , if I was suppose to be fired , it would have happened one way or another ) I still do n't think I fully understand it . It 's all based on our electrons , and the way they move through time . They taught us the algorithm , it made very little sense to me back then , and it makes very little sense to me know , if I was suppose to understand it , it would have happened , one way or another . <newline> <newline> Back then the machines were all different though , that made the job harder . Scientist all had different methods and strategies for how to manipulate the electrons , how to extract the information needed from them . My job would n't have existed if that was the case though , at this level of atomic research , radiation was a key concern , so bureaucrats like me where hired to ensure that we had no casualties . There was always a few each year though , always undergrad lab interns , god bless them and their families , there was nothing we can really do about it though , it would have happened one way or another . <newline> <newline> It was n't until Dr. Kilgore Trout perfected the systems that we finally had some real understanding , some real progress . His team discovered the time algorithm , or well we know it as the Trout Formula , Dr. Trout always said he did n't want it to be called that . Before the Trout Formula , the calculations where always inaccurate , Carny 's like Dave and Steve , who were suppose to be here 30 minutes ago , would not be able to do jack shit with the machines . It was also a very unsafe journey back as well . You 're always you through the process so you always have this `` Time Rope '' if you will , but it was always a risk . You could never go when you wanted to go either . Without the Trout Formula , you 'd calibrate your destination to September 2nd , 1945 , and end up with the Mongol Empire , it was a complete bitch . <newline> <newline> Now we have The Cathedrals though , the new machines , designed to be energy efficient from the ground up . Very easy to calibrate , very easy to inspect , and the only model allowed by the U.S. Government , built and designed in California , for the use of overweight Americans , trying to figure out how to spend the extra change they got from their second hot dog at the Fargo County Fair . Along that long pathway of fried shit , Dave and Steve are finally showing up . God . . . at least I 'm not a fucking Carny .

2,"This is all I got so far . Not sure where to go from here . I will post it on my site http : //swordsnstuff.net/ so you can comment on it there as well . <newline> <newline> It was day four of their trek , sleeping days and traveling at night so as not to be caught sleeping by any nocturnal predators . There were two full moons out tonight with the third a sliver of a crescent , and their path through the clearing towards the upcoming tree line was amiably illuminated . They had not spoken a word to each other for four nights , as their senses have been on alert for any unknown dangers that may lurk their way . No one knows what lies in Pythe Hills , as there is no record of anyone returning from a visit to “ the darks ” . <newline> <newline> They had been following the scent of smoke for a while now , and were approaching denser forest . We could be close . It had been an underwhelmingly uneventful journey so far , not even an encounter with one of the many deadly beasts thought to traverse these isolated lands , and this was the first sign of life they had found . They froze and crouched in unison . The crackle and pop of a campfire could be heard just ahead as they stalked forward . The smaller man , who was not small in stature in the least , hunched low over his crossbow as he inched forward while his partner , a tall , hulking individual , pulled his battle-axe from his hip mount and kept an upright stance as he distanced himself from his ally . <newline> <newline> They came upon the fire in a small clearing , tended by a diminutive figure sitting over it in hooded robes . They watched its keeper from their vantage points for a short time , and seeing no movement the large man went forward . <newline> <newline> “ Vern ! ” he was whisper yelling . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , I know ” he spoke in his deep booming tone “ I ’ ve been itchin ’ for blood for a while now and morg be damned if I let you have all the fun again , Creek. ” <newline> <newline> “ Hey mister ! ” Vern called out , smiling “ You know where I can find a sleazehouse around here ? I got ta spray somethin ’ fierce ! ” he thrusted the air a few times , in a universal gesture to get his point across . The robes didn ’ t stir . “ Heeeeyyyyy , you ’ re not a girl under there , are ya ’ ? “ He said coyly “ I promise I ’ ll be gentle. ” Creek closed in behind him keeping a watchful eye out as Vern lifted the hood , revealing the skull of a much decomposed corpse , maggots squirming through the eyeholes and a long black krellworm stretching from the left nasal cavity through a gap where a tooth was missing . Maybe in a childhood accident or a bar fight , Vern surmised as he dropped the hood back over the skull with a disappointed grimace . <newline> <newline> “ Uhhhhh sorry , not my type. ” <newline> <newline> An abrupt gust of wind whipped the flames into a frenzy , as the corpse unexpectedly leapt into the air . Vern bounded aside keeping Creek on the opposite side of the creature , surrounding it while watching his partners back . Floating in place with limbs swaying unnaturally like some kind of grotesque marionette being handled with inexperience ; it spoke to them in a phantom chorus of horrid whispers : <newline> <newline> “ Whaaaat seeeeeeeek yooooouuuuu ? ” <newline> <newline> “ We request an audience… with Hela. ” Creek yelled over the still roaring winds . He stood straight up , bow pointed straight at the carcass ’ skull while the flames intensified between them . Vern lowered his axe , not expecting much more than talk to occur here , as Creek could be very convincing at times . <newline> <newline> “ Yoooouuuu seeeeeek deeeaaaattthhhh. ” <newline> <newline> “ We ’ ll find no such think here , demon , now grant us an audience or it ’ s the axe fer ya ’ . ” Vern yelled as his smile widened , raising his axe back up in anticipation . The corpse stayed silent , hood still covering his decaying skull . Vern imagined it was scowling in disapproval when the fire blew out , darkening the forest again . . Creek immediately stowed his crossbow and lit a flame bolt in hope of some visibility . It wasn ’ t much , but at least he could see slightly beyond arm ’ s reach ; he passed it to Vern and lit another . As Vern took the “ torch ” he mounted his axe , an enormous single headed weapon with an iron block at the butt to be used as a bludgeon , onto his hip . He slid his fingers through his trusty knucks , an iron knuckle guard with pyramid-shaped spikes protruding out towards anyone unlucky enough to be within reach , while Creek pulled out one of his trusted daggers . The wind had stopped , leaving an unnerving silence , as their conversation partner had disappeared without a trace . They stood back-to-back , ready for battle for what seemed like an eternity . <newline> <newline> “ Guess he was all talk , eh ? ” Vern whispered . <newline> <newline> “ Not enough talk . We still don ’ t- “ <newline> <newline>

2,"*Just a note , I would put a title here if I knew what to title this . Also , see if you can find out what 's up with our main character before we even get to that chapter . * <newline> <newline> I push open the door , trying not the wake anyone in the house as I stepped into my crazy blue world . A whiff of nature flies into my nose quicker than usual , making me sneeze . I look to the sky and smile upon the sight of no clouds . Without thinking , I let go of the door handle and the door slams behind me . Startled , I jump and turn back . Nobody comes running or anything , so I assume I 'm not caught ... for now . <newline> <newline> It was n't like I was doing anything bad , but my parents would think I was mad for going outside at five in the morning . Truth be told , I like the outside too much not to watch the sun rise in the morning and set in the evening . At least my parents do n't have to worry about me not being able to get up for school in the morning , but it 's summer now and they probably expect me to sleep in . However , I 'd rather spend my time drinking in the nature . <newline> <newline> I push my hand into the grass and grab a handful . Grass is n't quite as soft as they say it is . It 's quite spiny , like the back of a hedgehog . I do n't really care , though . I 've gotten used to it after being here so much . It also does n't look so ... green . I figure every novel I read is fiction , because they always call grass green when I 've been taught that this color is blue . It 's an interesting color . <newline> <newline> The trees sway a bit more usual today . I did n't realize there could be so much wind in June . A leaf drifts towards me . I catch it in my hands and hold the stem . Studying it closely , I twirl it around and stroke my finger across it . The tan color is too closely-related to my own skin , I think . I 've never seen a leaf of quite this color . Fascinating . I know my parents say there 's brown leaves in fall and winter , but why is there one in summer ? <newline> <newline> I let go of it and watch it fly away in the wind . It 's like my thoughts . They always seem to drift off and suddenly it 's dinner time and I ca n't remember what I was just thinking about . Nonetheless , I still pay attention and I listen . I make good grades in school , somehow . I just wish I could do more free drawing in art . Using my own imagination is better than having something to guide me along . <newline> <newline> My thoughts drift back to the leaf . A tan leaf . In summer . Maybe fall 's coming along soon . But then again , why would fall come so early in June ? It 's a mystery to me . Maybe I 'll figure out soon .

2,"The researchers were tense . Ever since their existence had been theorized , the 'Beings ' , as they were called , had been the center of every scientist 's research .

The Beings were not gods . They were far from it . The extent of their capabilities was unknown . The only thing known about them , was they existed in an additional dimension . Not another dimension , just another one . Humans could n't see them , the same way a line drawn on a piece of paper could n't see humans . <newline> <newline> The room was focused on a device in the center of the room , a sleek , metallic tower with an antenna rising out the top . The device consisted of two parts . The first part would generate radio waves , it was extremely rudimentary for the focus of the device was the second part : A particle tunnel , which would transmit the waves to what was hoped to be the dimension the Beings existed in . The waves would not transmit a specific message , it was hoped that the transmission of waves itself would be enough to signal to them that we would like to establish communications with them . <newline> <newline> When it was time to launch the device , a large chunk of the less senior scientists , including me , were escorted out of the room , leaving only a handful of the most senior and experienced scientist 's in the room . The door was closed and sealed , and was not to be opened for the next half- hour . The minutes ticked past , and soon enough it was time for the doors to open . When this failed to occur , the scientists started shifting around and a few of the scientists started hypothesizing on possible failures that could have occurred , however they soon stopped after most of the room began glaring at them . More than an hour after the experiment started , security was called and power tools had to be used to open the lock on the door . There were no shouts of protest from inside the room , and once the door was kicked down the scientist 's pushed and shoved each other to glimpse the inside of the room . <newline> <newline> A silence settled over the scientists and the guards who had opened the door . The room , once covered in white tiling , now had the linoleum on the wall exposed , as if the room had never existed . But perhaps the most disturbing thing in the room was the writing on the walls , various messages carved into the linoleum . The biggest , most prominent message was on the wall directly opposite the door . It was in capitals , and covered most of the lower half of the wall . It was only two words , which sent a chill down the spines of everybody who read it : `` THEY 'RE REAL '' .

2,"Prologue <newline> <newline> <newline> He floated , insensate and inert , suspended within an eternity of darkness . <newline> Awareness sparked…once , twice… before flaring like a solitary candle flame , wavering at first , and then steadying . <newline> <newline> Bit by bit , infinity receded , until at last only seconds remained , dribbling past like sand grains in an hourglass . <newline> <newline> He stirred . <newline> <newline> `` I…I am… '' <newline> <newline> For some indeterminate period of time he could not recall who he was . But then… <newline> <newline> `` Semyaza… Yes ! I am called…Semyaza . '' <newline> <newline> Lacking eyes , he extended a portion of himself , exploring with supreme caution , testing the space that held him . Trace fluctuations in the surrounding field coalesced into a visual representation , letting him peer outward in every direction . <newline> <newline> Other parts of his mind reactivated now , integrating themselves into the whole . Within minutes the process was complete . <newline> <newline> He extended himself further , straining to sense otherness . He encountered no other entity . <newline> <newline> And then , if he had been in his body , his limbs would have begun trembling . A tidal wave of realization crashed over him . <newline> <newline> The plan had worked ! In spite of the danger , in spite of his misgivings—in spite of everything—the plan had worked ! <newline> <newline> The quality and tone of the ambient field conveyed certain facts to him . Aphelion had come and gone . Another Iron Age was receding into the past . Most important of all , the Annunaki were not present—though the field-density they required to manifest had long since passed a crucial… <newline> <newline> The Annunaki ! <newline> <newline> Cold terror triggered his fundamental training protocols and he verified all his previous observations a second time—with intense single-mindedness now . That completed , he neutralized his anxiety , mandating self-composure in its place . He dared not surrender to panic . Time was too precious and too many questions remained to be answered . Among them : how long had he been gone ? <newline> <newline> `` If I could but see the sky , I could compare the constellations ’ positions to the flow of the seasons , and then know the precise amount of time that has passed . '' <newline> <newline> Yet even in his present condition , deaf , blind , and isolated , he understood much . Most important of all , the fact that he had awakened—that he had survived—meant his battle against unspeakable evil must now begin anew . No other possibility existed . <newline> <newline> Taking stock , Semyaza verified that The Records had survived the journey . These represented a full accounting of the agonies the Annunaki had inflicted on the human race , the near-fatal wounding . <newline> <newline> Checking those memories for completeness invoked ancient pain . In his weakened state , even this brief exposure might have damaged him further , save that instinct—coupled with long practice—caused him to deactivate his grief before it could overwhelm him . <newline> <newline> Marshaling his critical reserves , cautious lest he reveal himself through some faint ripple in the fabric that held him , he willed an action . <newline> <newline> And then there remained nothing to do but wait . <newline>

2,"“ Are you sure this is wise , Elder ? ” <newline> <newline> “ To what are you referring to ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You know full well what I ’ m referring to . Letting those humans live on our world . You saw what they did to their old planet . They ran it dry , emptied its resources , and caused the death of millions of species in order to secure their own survival. ” <newline> <newline> The tall humanoid creatures , their bodies constructed of many muscular strands , entered the council chamber that orbited around the once elegant Earth . The many holo-screens around the chamber showed different views of the human fleet , or what remained of it after constant fighting in order to secure resources . <newline> <newline> “ Look , they even fought among themselves once their supplies began to run low . They are a primitive race that seeks only destruction and violence . They have nothing useful to bring to the rest of the galaxy . I say we rid ourselves of their parasitic nature here and now . '' <newline> <newline> The elder stroked his tentacles that resemble a human beard . His frail skull showed the workings of a vast network that was constantly calculating . <newline> <newline> “ Be it as they may , did we not once also resemble these “ primitives ” ? We only managed to succeed where they failed due to our biological evolution. ” <newline> <newline> “ Even if that is so , we can ’ t allow them onto our planet ! ” <newline> <newline> A loud voice echoes from what appears to be a massive circular table at the center of the hall . <newline> <newline> “ I agree with Ry ’ ol , Elder . We can not allow them to colonize our planet . However , there is ‘ that ’ place. ” <newline> <newline> The Elder ’ s many eyes widened at his words . <newline> <newline> “ You would send this weakened race to the forbidden moon ? Not even our strongest warriors have managed to tame that wildness . It would be better to do as Ry'ol bids and glass them here ! ” <newline> <newline> “ The members of the Black Cloud have all decided to use these humans to secure the ancient grounds , Elder . If these creatures have as much potential as you say , then they will succeed where we have failed . They will have a home to live , and will be helping the Empire . It is the best choice of action , is it not ? ” <newline> <newline> The Elder grit his teeth , which resemble that of a shark . Even given his position , he was in no place to question the Black Cloud , the organization that was formed from a representative of all the Empire ’ s races . He bowed his head . <newline> <newline> “ So be it . The humans will be allowed onto Frijol , and there they will be allowed to live… ” <newline> <newline> He turned his eyes to the holo-screens once more . He saw the half-salvaged ships of humanity , the blast marks from their futile battles . <newline> <newline> “ …And the Alder bless them , for they will need it… ” <newline>

2,"Bump . Bump . Bump <newline> <newline> `` Mr. Dodson , open the door ! '' <newline> <newline> Bump . Bump . Bump . <newline> <newline> `` Easy , David . Relax . Lets bring in Bo , '' I said softly . David pulls out his cell and calls Bo . The wall I 'm leaning on is full of graffiti , and theres a faint smell of piss in the air . Definitely not the favorite part in my line of work . I 'm used to roughing someone up for money the usual way ; in their resturant or office , not this piece of shit apartment . <newline> <newline> `` Bo 's coming . This guy the boss wants better be worth it , '' sighs David . <newline> `` Be careful David , this guy is like the wizard of escapeing from anyone . The boss was vague about it , but I do n't want to fuck this up . <newline> <newline> Bo climbs the last steps of the floor David and I was in . He walks closer and we can see his black complexion . <newline> `` Ya 'll need help ? '' Bo grunts . <newline> <newline> I point at the door . As Bo turns to face the door , I can see the glare of his shiny protruding horns from his mouth . He must of got them whiten . <newline> Bo stretches his back by flailing his hands back and forth between his waist . Bo yells , `` Alright boys , I 'll show ya what an orc can do ! '' <newline> <newline> Bo forcefully kicks the door . David and I both go in with our guns drawn . It 's a simple studio apartment . A filthy apartment with books everywhere . <newline> `` Mr. Dodson , '' I yelled , `` we need you to show yourself . We can make this easy or with a gun wound . Your choice . '' <newline> It 's quite , but intuition tells me our target is here . I whispered , `` David use those pointy ears of yours and hear for any footsteps '' <newline> David lets a sigh of exhaustion from the crap I was giving him . <newline> <newline> We continue to look around until david yells `` He 's invisible ! Mr. Dodson is actually a fucking wizard ! '' <newline> He points to one of the corners of the apartment . I pull my gun up and shoot . <newline> Mr. Dodson lets out a yell of pain and collapses to the floor fully visible . <newline> <newline> `` You didnt have to kill him Roy , '' yelled David . <newline> I ignore my idiot partner and walk closer . A stereotypical wizard with a pointy hat and beard . Mr. Dodson opens his eyes and his hand start to glow . From the floor he extended his hand to my face and a white light blinded me . <newline> `` Ah he used a spell on me ! '' I cover my eyes and backed up . <newline> David raised his gun but the wizard teleported away . <newline> Just great , we lost our target and now i need to go to the hospital to lift this curse off my eyes . <newline>

2,"The familiar smells of mold and decay came drifting out from the darkening depths of the swamp-lands and into the muddy clearing where the rotting little cabin stood . Its derelict roof sagged into a heavy frown , there were no windows , and it had only one entryway guarded by a tattered curtain . The inside was all tracked with filth from the bare feet of little ones scurrying in and out . Each dirty floorboard creaked horribly and with a groan unique from all the rest . There was no proper fireplace , only a cooking fire sitting upon crumbling bricks in the middle of the floor . Neither was there any proper chimney , rather the small gaps in the house ’ s insecure frame were the only means of ventilation . The room was hazy with smoke . A small fire crackled , heating a softly boiling pot of dubious black liquid . A goblin ’ s spindly green hand dipped a spoon in and stirred the viscous stew . The goblin ’ s features would be frightening to any human who might lay eyes on them . That greenish hue saturated all of the warty leathery skin wrapping around her slender bony frame . Her head was human enough , but her ears were pointy on the ends , her teeth were sharp inter-locking ivory spears , and her eyes were black empty pits . Among her own people however , she was not ugly , but rather an attractive older woman , her name was Grazil . <newline> With supper nearly ready , she went to summon her family . A goblin ’ s arms are as long as its legs allowing it to drop to all fours at will and gallop like an animal . She did this now , cantering out the door and into the mud . <newline> <newline> `` Fega ! Perusala ! Where do you run ? '' She called into the drooping canopies and slimy depths of the swamp around her . <newline> <newline> `` I come mother . '' <newline> <newline> `` Me too ! '' <newline> <newline> Two green little goblin kits galloped out of the shadowy wilderness , their frames small but wiry with hidden strength . The smaller one tackled her sister , and they rolled around in the squishy , wet , muck in a ball of hissing , scratching , and biting . Fega , the little provoker , managed to pin her elder sister Perusala for a moment , and took advantage of it by sinking her teeth in to her shoulder . Perusala howled and struggled away . Fega hissed victoriously as Perusala scrambled to hide behind her mother . <newline> <newline> `` I win Perusala ! '' Fega squealed . <newline> <newline> Grazil gently cuffed the loser . `` Come in , time to feed you . '' They darted inside snapping at each other as they went . The smoke still hung in the cabin as Grazil came in behind them , pausing to re-adjust the curtain . <newline> <newline> [ Thanks for this prompt , OP . It feels really good to have an excuse to make myself hammer this out . ] <newline> <newline> ( Sorry for the editing , I 'm new to proper formatting . )

2,"If the Earth had a heart , it would have skipped a beat . All around the world every screen cut off simultaneously and was replaced with the familarly disturbing image of a faceless man , and an echoing roar came from every speaker . <newline> <newline> “ HEELLLLOOOO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN~ ! ” People from every country frantically pulled their cellphones from their pockets to see the direct stream . In Tokyo , every digital billboard was broadcasting the message . In New York , everyone in time square stood paralyzed in fear , and in Bangkok thousands fell to their knees to pray for protection for themselves and their loved ones . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s that time of year once again~ ! ” The voice was reminiscent of a radio show host from the 1930 ’ s , and the man danced around the blinding white backdrop with the eerie finesse of a practiced routine . Despite being faceless , his jubilant demeanor was echoed through his movements . <newline> <newline> The camera followed him fluidly until he came to a stop at an upright game wheel that was rather large . Assuming the figure was of average height , the wheel would have stood at about six feet tall ; it had several dozen color-coded sections separated by wooden pegs , and each section had a seemingly random word cutout from a newspaper headline glued on . <newline> <newline> After years of watching the self-titled “ host , ” everyone knew his game would be themed . When he gave the wheel a swift jerk , millions of eyes watched in anticipation . <newline> <newline> “ Let ’ s see what this year ’ s theme will be~ ! ” The host exclaimed in a singsong voice . The wheel steadily began to lose speed as it approached the “ children ” section of the wheel . No one wanted a repeat of the previous year , but it wasn ’ t looking good . To the dismay of the viewers , the pointer was seemingly going to stay caught on the peg of the “ children ” section , but it was just a hair ’ s breadth away from “ renowned. ” The fraction of a second that the pointer lingered on the peg felt like hours , but , finally , it snapped away . <newline> <newline> “ Renowned ! ! ! ! ” He cheered , mockingly throwing his arms in the air as if he ’ d won an award . “ Looks like we ’ re gon na have some contestant that have fans to root for them this year ! ” A black and white outline of glasses and a suit appeared on the host and his voice changed suddenly to a professional tone . “ Seriously people , a little bit of support goes a long way. ” He laughed hysterically at his own joke as he hunched over and clenched his own stomach . His convulsions came to a sudden stop ; an instant later he was standing erect and back to his previous state . <newline> <newline> “ Anyways. ” He said , “ Let ’ s take a look around the world at our contestants , shall we ? ”

2,"**Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean – Present Day** <newline> <newline> The ship rocked slowly back and forth on the gentle ocean waves . It was a small ship , only twenty-four or twenty-five feet long and maybe half that wide . There were two outboard motors but they had long since been turned off letting the boat just drift with the currents . It was dark outside and the air was thick and moist because of a dense fog that surrounded the ship completely . The moon was in its new phase giving off no light at all and the stars were completely hidden by the fog . A single yellowish light on top of the small cabin was the only thing that lit the surrounding area a small distance before being engulfed by the fog . <newline> <newline> Beneath the deck of the ship , inside one of the small rooms , were two men watching another man bound hand and foot to a wooden chair . A third man was standing over a table focused intently on something , moving his hands quickly . There was tape over the bound man 's mouth and a cloth was tied bandana-like around his head covering his eyes . The two watching him did not know who he was , nor did they care . They had been paid very well to carry out this order and had no intention of interfering with anything . <newline> <newline> The third man finished what he was doing with the sound a metal click and turned to face the bound man . In his right hand was a semi-automatic pistol he had just finished loading with the first round now in the chamber . He walked to the man in the chair , and placed the cold steel of the barrel against the bound man 's left temple . <newline> <newline> The bound man had recently woke up after being drugged for the past several hours . He felt the steel against his head and knew what it was . Then he heard the click of the hammer being cocked and realized these were his last moments alive . As he struggled in vain against the thick boat rope that tied him down , he tried to yell but the tape muffled his voice to almost nothing . <newline> <newline> `` How had it come to this ? ” he thought to himself . <newline> <newline> His intentions had been perfectly civil and yet everyone had taken them the wrong way . Things certainly had not turned out the way he thought they would . He miscalculated several actions and now that was about to cost him his life . <newline> <newline> The bound man 's covered eyes registered a flash of light at exactly the same time his ears heard the click of the trigger being pulled back . In that split second of time he thought of where he had gone wrong , what had he done to deserve this , and why this was happening to him . He felt an intense sharp pain and his consciousness blinked out in an instant .

2,"On the wings of the horizon , the sun rose to awake the day-dwellers from sleep and lull the nocturnal critters to slumber . The shifting waves began to recede its tide , along with the darkness , back to the sea . The scent of sea salt brushed the uncovered sands , and then , it came across the faces of the fishermen . They came in small troupes from the dainty houses at the edge of town to the wooden boats docked at the shore <newline> <newline> The town 's people soon came grumbling from their beds to start their day . Shops began to open and the buzz began to awake the town . The blacksmith began lighting coals to melt mal-shapen ore . The salesmen began to holler their bargains . The bakery infested with the smell of freshly baked bread . All of the senses being richly stimulated by the town 's air . The orphanage , however , was a bit off the town , isolated in the cultivated terraces of farmland . <newline> <newline> A young boy was staring out the window , watching the slowly brightening sky above the horizon . The day would begin soon , but the boy simply sat on his crude bed thinking . <newline> <newline> `` Hmmmmmm ... '' <newline> <newline> He was trying to think of something , but it mainly came as the vibrations from his throat . <newline> <newline> The sound of a bell broke the silence . All the others began to stir from their beds , yawning and rubbing their eyes . The boy aligned himself with the other children , forming a mob of dissonant children . <newline> <newline> He reappeared in front of a cracked , but visibly clear mirror . He took a thorough look of himself . His hair was shaggy and raised to its ends from a restless night . not much else defined him , and he pondered on this thought . <newline> <newline> `` Raphael ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Coming ! '' <newline> <newline> Raphael once again dissolved into the multitude of children . He only could be located from scrunching through the scattered scattered conversations among the mess hall . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Ralph , are you okay ? '' <newline> <newline> Ralph 's face was drummed into the morning gruel . He did not seem to be moving . <newline> <newline> A louder noise erupted , `` Hey ! Ra-alph ! `` ; but by the time Ralph stuttered consciousness , he was being given a thorough shake by a pair of talons gripped tightly . <newline> <newline> `` Alright ! I 'm awake . '' <newline> <newline> The pair of hands returned , with the rest of its possessing body , to its original seat . <newline> <newline> `` Geez , Crow . You did n't need to make so much noise . '' <newline> <newline> The startling noise rousing attracted looks from around the mess hall , but was quickly silenced by the tall shadow clanking its feet on the hard floor . <newline> <newline> `` Hello my dear children . What seems to be so exciting that ... '' <newline> <newline> `` YOU would disturb our quiet morning meal ?

2,"( This is still *very much* a work in progress , but why not . ) <newline> <newline> Estelle walked along the dark , quiet streets on edge the city . She re-counted measly change that one could hardly consider tips from working the late shift at the diner . She huffed , half tempted to just toss it all in the street out of frustration . She decided against it though , seeing as she needed every penny she could find to make sure her rent was paid . No one was going to do that for her . Not since she ran away from home two years ago at the age of seventeen . She tried couch surfing at a few friends ' places ( if one could call them that ) but it never lasted long . It was n't that Estelle was ungrateful for their kindness so much as it was her not being able to stand needing help . <newline> <newline> She sighed once more as she turned the corner and saw that she had just missed the last bus for the night . She mindlessly kicked a pebble when she happened to notice a faint glow out of the corner of her eye coming from down the alley . She looked around to see if there was anyone else that could see it before making her way to the source . <newline> <newline> She noted that the alley seemed a bit cleaner than most for this part of town . Maybe today had been garbage day ? The closer she got to whatever it was that was glowing , the more confidant she was that it was n't just someone on their phone . The light seemed to have a green tint and pulsed softly , almost as though it was moving . <newline> <newline> Estelle came around a garbage can and was finally able to see the light fully against the brick wall of a building . It was indeed green and moving in a swirl-like motion . She waved her hand in front of it in the hopes that her hand would cast a shadow over it . Seeing that casting a shadow did n't seem to work , she decided to touch it . Only she did n't touch it so much as *go through it* with her hand . She attempted to pull her arm out without any success . Estelle 's breathing increased as she started to panic , twisting and jerking her body anyway she could think of as long as her arm would come unstuck . <newline> <newline> After spending several minutes of this , while she could n't pull herself out of whatever this strange light was , she could easily continue to go through it . She did n't full understand , seeing as there *was* a brick wall right behind it . But what did she have to lose at this moment ? Taking several deep breaths to steel her nerves , she pushed forward and entered the swirl of light , not knowing what lay beyond the other side .

2,"*This is a very rough draft* <newline> <newline> Everyone was staring at Harpo Greene when he picked it up .

2,"I have odd thoughts which turn into book ideas , but I do n't have the time to turn any of them into full fledged novels ... Here 's the start of one I 'm currently mulling around on ... . <newline> <newline> “ Faggot. ” <newline> <newline> Coming out of the closet , a voice was heard , “ James ! Do I have to send you to .. ” <newline> <newline> “ Hold up , Sergeant White. ” Smith ’ s voice was slightly raised , imitating his hand as the sergeant came out of the closet , several scarves still hanging from his fatigues and weapon , a result of the blast they had entered the closet to escape . <newline> <newline> “ Serously . Faggot. ” <newline> <newline> Specialist James was correct . Perched on the couch in what was left of the shattered living room and bedroom was a bundle of wood . <newline> <newline> “ Was that there when we came in here ? ” His agitation subsiding , Sergeant White took the time to check himself for shrapnel and remove the clothing he ’ s become entangled in while in the closet . <newline> <newline> “ Don ’ t think so , Sarge. ” This from the fourth member of their squad , third lieutenant Kevin Space . “ Kinda odd to have wood in an apartment , don ’ t ’ cha think ? ” Despite outranking the sergeant , Space usually deferred to White ; Space having been in the service just a few weeks past bootcamp , while White was a career soldier , and on his fourth tour of duty . <newline> <newline> Kevin Space was an overly large man , though from his quiet demeanor , he seemed to like letting others do the talking , himself just staying back and watching events unfold . <newline> <newline> “ Wood , heh. ” <newline> <newline> “ Jesus , James . Just how old are you today ? ” The other reason White was deferred to was his status as defacto den-mother to the squad . While not the biggest of men , he commanded respect earned from surviving three tours of duty with all his limbs intact ; not many soldiers could say the same in this war . <newline> <newline> White squinted at James in the sunlight . There was a lot of sunlight coming in from the missing wall of the apartment . All four men shared a look and moved to the edge of what had been the apartment ’ s kitchenette . Water was pouring out of the destroyed sink , down the rubble of the missing wall , and out into what could best be described as an abyss . <newline> <newline> “ That would make a long fall. ” James , again the voice of the absurd for the squad , pointed out the obvious . <newline> <newline> On the ninth floor of what had been an apartment block , the men looked out at an immense crater… <newline>

2,"I did n't expect her to be so blue . Maybe pale , or nothing at all , but blue , she did n't even like that color , and yet here she was . <newline> <newline> It would have been the dramatic exit she was looking for , but they had cut off her dress to perform the autopsy , and now , draped in just a sheet , her departure seemed less precise . Not the perfect `` Fuck you '' she had wanted to emit from beyond the grave . <newline> <newline> `` You must be in shock , '' the coroner said in a flat , monotone , that comes form spending decades uttering this same sentence over and over . <newline> <newline> I shook my head , `` No , not really , I mean , she would have hated the sheet , what is that , 200 hundred thread count ? Shock though , '' I laughed out loud , `` She 's been waiting to make this escape since I met her .

2,"*Note : This is loosely based on the US and world that we live in . * <newline> <newline> *It 's a short prologue . * <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> After the collapse of the government of Durren , the entire nation fell apart due to every state wanting to take its position of power . It started slow , with people only shouting on TV and a few protests , but soon enough bombings and shootings occurred . Shortly after , people started getting into all out wars across the states . I was seventeen at the time the government collapse , and it 's been two years since . I joined a group called the Knights of the States , and it was led by a man named Eric . <newline> <newline> It 's hard to remember that he once taught me math . <newline> <newline> Eric was only twenty-eight but had grown old . He used to be a happier man with a shaved head , enthusiastic about teaching , even if it was to noisy highschoolers . He never got angry ; from what I saw and heard and was always willing to help . He had kept these mannerisms as the major fighting began and it 's why he rose to prominence . I did n't know what kind of training he had , but he knew how to lead and fight . The Knights quickly grew in number early on , as I heard , and after a year or so of fighting , I joined up for safety . <newline> <newline> Years of war that led nowhere had takes its toll on all of us , but he had it worse , being responsible for our lives . I joined him sometimes after turning eighteen because he was the only person who seemed to care about staying true to his morals and helping the people . Plenty of warring tribes had grown , but the Knights were focused on stopping the crueler clans from overstepping their bounds . We were essentially a mercenary band , but with Eric 's guidance , we became known as the only `` good guys '' left in this section of the states . He did n't seem to care or worry about a unified nation , only that the people left should be protected . People looked up to him , people feared or loved him , everyone in this area knew about him . <newline> <newline> And here I am , staring at his fresh corpse . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Criticize away

2,"I remember the day I met her . <newline> <newline> It was a match made in heaven . <newline> <newline> She was beautiful , an angel . <newline> <newline> I just stared , awestruck . Or dumbstruck , if you prefer . <newline> <newline> She was standing in the road , a black dress floating around her like shadows . <newline> <newline> She smiled at me softly , reached out her hand ... And then she was gone . <newline> <newline> I spent eighteen months in hospital from that car accident . <newline> <newline> A long time to think . <newline> <newline> I realised it there . <newline> <newline> She was the most stunning thing I 'd ever met . <newline> <newline> She was worth it . <newline> <newline> A couple dozen pill bottles later , her hand is pressed against my forehead , staring down at me with those empty eyes , concern filling the black void . <newline> <newline> She spoke then , a voice like the gentle trickle of a stream , `` Hey ... You should n't be here . Its not your time yet . Not yet . '' <newline> <newline> `` I missed you . '' The words tumbled out , as I clumsily reached up to stroke her cheek . <newline> <newline> She smiled sadly and stroked my forehead , and I woke up . <newline> <newline> She sent me back . <newline> <newline> I tried , I really tried to do my best . <newline> <newline> She did n't want to see me , not yet ... <newline> <newline> But the depths get to you . They chase you down , like they did on the road . <newline> <newline> She caught my wrist as I fell from the bridge , hauling me up without effort . <newline> <newline> She looked at me sadly with those black eyes and stroked my cheek , `` Why so sad ? '' <newline> <newline> I did n't have an answer . <newline> <newline> She sighed and pressed something into my hand . <newline> <newline> It was a black rose petal . <newline> <newline> `` What is it ? '' I asked , the clumsyness of my words piling on top of each other . <newline> <newline> She smiled and tucked a strand of hair behind one ear , `` A promise . '' <newline> <newline> She vanished in a swirl of shadows , and I was left standing on a bridge , cars moving passed slowly , as rain began to fall . <newline>

2,"They break you down , watching your eyes for the moment then putting the knife in just a little more , twisting , glint in their glittering eyes . You are now theirs . If fortune favours , your logic recovers in the coming months or years , and breaks the mechanics of your new and alien mind . <newline> <newline> Misha Dimetrieff <newline> Salamis City <newline> 21-7-385 <newline> Prologue <newline> <newline> Constantine looked around the dimly lit vehicle for a familiar face . The eight-wheeled armoured carrier rocked and jerked over an undulating road , tipping into well-worn ruts and glancing off impinging boulders . Some of the new conscripts glanced furtively around the large cabin , grey-faced in grey light . They tried their best to appear stoic but were betrayed by nervous tics or tracks of sweat . The more experienced troopers forgave them their attempts at appearing calm . They knew where the carrier was going . <newline> He searched the faces but recognised no one . A woman sitting across from him noticed his expression and winked . He was surprised by the moment and smiled weakly . He felt a brief moment of familiarity . The whine of the engine , the colours and smells filled neat places in his memory . She was a spectre , he thought , reminding him that others knew the joke and were in on it . <newline> In a few minutes they were dead together in the hard ground , their arms by sheer chance lying across each other and their faces each toward the other . For his part , when the time came , Constantine realised during the dwindling of his breath , with the light of exploding metal highlighting her cheekbones that he knew exactly who she was . He had always wondered how he would die and the texture of his death was this - a small sadness , burning metal inside , and the touch of his wife . <newline> And then there was nothing but an encompassing blackness . <newline> And then there was green all around , pain throughout and anger because he had lost something and he had lost it before . <newline> “ Sedate him please. ” A woman 's voice . Not malicious but not containing the smallest mote of care . This was not the first time he 'd seen the green and he knew it for a few days until he was made to forget this and everything that came before . <newline>

2,"*You ca n't outrun him , you know , * my mind reminded me . *He 'll always be one step ahead . * <newline> <newline> *That does n't mean I ca n't make it hard for him , though , * I thought to myself . <newline> <newline> I was about 60 feet underground , in *his* domain , so he probably knew this place better than I did . This place was worse than the Paris catacombs ; it felt like I was running in circles , and I probably was . *Why did we have to follow that map ? * I asked silently , *Why could n't we just leave it alone ? It was my fault we went here , it was my fault Jules got poisined , and it was my fault he found us . And now Jules is gone , and I ca n't do anything about it . * It was starting to get harder to run , and the duffel on my back certainly was n't helping . <newline> <newline> In a flash , and a *bang* , he appeared , and I stopped dead in my tracks . Tall and looming , especially in this low light , he beckoned me closer , eager to finish me , and knowing I had no other option . `` Silly child , why must you run from the inevitable ? '' he questioned . `` Come with me , and I promise this will be over soon . '' <newline> <newline> Struggling to come up with a response , I slowly backtreaded , trying to process the fastest way out . `` N-never ! You c-ca n't make me go w-with you ! '' I shouted , with more than a hint of fear in my voice ; I knew there was no way I would leave by myself , let alone with Jules . I would n't even *know* where to start looking for him . <newline> <newline> `` Very well ; you 've chosen the hard way , and I 'll be sure to make it that way for you ! '' he snapped , lunging towards me , sword drawn . <newline> <newline> I bolted straight up out of bed , not wanting to process what would happen next . <newline> <newline> [ [ I 'm not the best writer , so criticism and feedback are appreciated . ] ]

2,"It was a rainy night in Tokyo . <newline> The street lamps and illuminated signs of the Shibuya district reflected off the puddles on the ground . A young Japanese woman moved through the crowd , carrying an umbrella . Her heels sent ripples through the puddles she stepped through . Her dress , too short for the weather , blew in the wind . <newline> She passed by a small electronics store and turned away from the crowd , as if to enter . But instead she approached her true destination , the darkened alleyway lying in wait beside it . She held her head high to mask her trepidation , and walked into the alley . The grimy brick walls and garbage debris made her begin to reconsider her decision , yet she continued on . She turned a corner , vanishing out of sight from the passerbys in the street . <newline> No sooner had she rounded the corner she froze . A figure stood at the exit of the alleyway . She gulped and cleared her throat . <newline> `` H­-hello , '' she said . <newline> The figure stood silent and did not move . She clutched her umbrella tighter . <newline> `` Are you the man I 'm supposed to meet here ? '' <newline> As if in confirmation , the figure reached into its jacket and began to remove something . The woman relaxed . <newline> `` Oh good , for a moment I thought— '' <newline> She froze . Her eyes grew wide and she began to tremble . <newline> T​he figure had pulled a knife from its jacket . <newline> She glanced down the alley she had come from , looking for help that was n't there . She looked back only to find the figure on top of her . <newline> The blade plunged into her throat . <newline> She tried to cry out , but no sound escaped her lips . She locked eyes with the stranger , and the knife was ripped from her neck , letting the blood flow freely from the wound . She weakened , and collapsed onto the ground in a heap . She looked up at the rainy night sky . <newline> The last thing she saw was the inhuman smile of her attacker . And then her world went black .

2,"**The Tribe** <newline> <newline> They hunt in the fields and in the woods , stitching together clothes of animal hide and making spears and bows . They fish in the rivers , fashioning themselves nets and hooks . They scavenge in the forests for roots , nuts , and berries . They move with the changing of the seasons . <newline> <newline> <newline> Their children play together , carefree , running and jumping . They roll around in the tall grass and splash in the shallow pools . They help in the finding of food and the building of tools . The whole tribe is content . <newline> <newline> <newline> Their way of life is a simple one , of hunting and gathering , eating and sleeping , always on the move . They live as a tribe , enjoying the simple pleasures of living and the quiet beauty of the natural world .

They speak of wars and wonders . <newline> <newline> <newline> The tribe elders tell the stories of great heroes and conquerors .

They explore the husks of ancient decrepit towers and cities . They play in the long-dead corpses of the ancient metal war-machines , long silenced . The tribe scavenges from the ruins spare bits of metal , spare bits of cloth , ancient relics to make tools and clothes . The crown of a king who once commanded the entire world is now a speartip for one of the tribe ’ s young boys . The torn robe of a general who once commanded twelve million souls is now the swaddling cloth for one of the tribe ’ s newborn . The ancient power of the people 's ’ past is felt in nothing but relics and stories . <newline> <newline> <newline> The tribe ’ s life is a simple one , eking out a living from land and ruins , telling the stories and laughing , forgetting the wars that plagued a nation ’ s two thousand year past .

2,"Wrote this a while ago , would love an opinion ! Hopefully it 'll still happen . Yes , this is a prologue . <newline> <newline> Red : a beautiful colour . Both seen and used daily , embracing things like fire trucks , bricks , clothes , and logos alike . Many people all around the globe love the colour . Today I despise it . Dripping , leaking , gushing from my body , it pours to the ground . I can ’ t stand , falling helplessly to the ground screaming in agony . My arm involuntarily wanders to the wound as if examining it would save me . It wouldn ’ t . A single bullet pierced through my heart . It should have killed me instantly , but instead I lie on the pavement bleeding in the cold of night , not more than 50 meters from my house . <newline> <newline> “ Why me ? ” No louder than a whisper now my voice croaks out , begging the world for an answer . I ’ m just an average sixteen year old boy . I don ’ t have any enemies , hell I barely even have any friends . So why me ? What possessed someone to murder me on such a beautiful night ? <newline> <newline> I turn my gaze away from the examining the street and up to the starry night sky . That ’ s when I hear the steps . Quickly advancing on me , they slowly get louder even though it sounds like they were put through a filter . Heavy footsteps are rapidly approaching my fading body . No doubt it was the killer rushing forward to finish the job . With the little strength left that I can muster I cringe back , my eyes refusing to close . If I ’ m going to die I ’ ll make sure to use my senses for the last time even though I feel them fading rapidly . <newline> <newline> My eyes strain to see who my killer was . Out of all of the things in my life , knowing my killer is now the most important . My watery hazel eyes stare to my side expecting to see someone come into my view at any second . All of a sudden my fantasy becomes reality with a figure stepping into my view . A man ? A woman ? I can ’ t tell , my eyes slowly fading into a black . Was this the end ? Would I simply cease to exist , not even having the chance to regret all of my wasted time in this world ? <newline> <newline> My breathing slows , and I know that my time is almost up . I strain to open my eyes one last time , to take the image of my killer to the grave . Knowing this one simple fact would somehow make this all a little bit more bearable . The feeling of a cold barrel on the other side of my short black hair let me know I would never get my answer . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry it had to come to this kid , ” The voice emanates from somewhere above . It ’ s definitely a woman ’ s voice . I can ’ t the gun being cocked through the ever dampening filter over my senses . I prepare myself for the worst thing I can imagine . Death . One final shot sends me into complete darkness . <newline>

2,"They have no clue I could kill them all in a heartbeat , thought the green magician . He twisted his bleeding wrists in the handcuffs holding him in the chair they had bolted to the floor . He breathed long heavy breaths fighting to get air into his bruised ribcage . They had been beating him for what seemed like hours . If the blood demon he was hunting didn ’ t show up soon , everybody would have to die . He raised his eyes to the hulking white dumbass with brass knuckles . He would have to die first , he thought . Why , because that ’ s what happened when you pissed the green magician off . You paid one way or another , sometimes with your life . <newline> <newline> <newline> The hulking dumbass gave a pause for a moment as he saw the unbroken glint of steal in the eyes looking at him through the swollen bloody mess of a face . His name was Clint and he was starting to have an uneasy feeling he wasn ’ t fond off . He had been approached a few days before by a priest in a black sedan . He had been given a picture of some punk kid that had been causing trouble for some local dealers . The man had given him a kilo just to pull him off the street , rough him up and hold him till they stopped by to kill him . <newline> <newline> <newline> It had seemed like an easy job . He had heard of the kid for a while . He called himself the green magician . Somehow he had managed to sniff out a couple of the top dealers and point them out to the law . Plus he managed to stay one step ahead of everyone that had been hunting the bounty on him . Until Clint found him that is . Clint had heard the word on the street that there was something weird about him . That he got lucky to often . Clint wiped the blood off his hand and laughed to himself . Stupid kid was n't was n't so lucky now . <newline> <newline> <newline> Still in high school the green magician had fallen for the wrong girl . Her job was to seduce young men and then get them hooked on cocaine . Clint had used her services more than once himself . He knew about the bruises and had added a few . Clint didn ’ t know it but he was an asshole . Mostly because he liked to beat the women he slept with . Clint didn ’ t think of himself as asshole . Clint always thought of himself as in control and in charge . <newline> <newline> <newline> The kilo they had given him was superb shit , Clint thought . He and his crew had busted into it . It was the hard white . The green magician could have told him it wasn ’ t really cocaine at all . The green magician could have told him that what it was had mixed with the ashes of the girls like the one he had fallen for and others . He could tell Clint about the rituals and the demon they fed . Clint wouldn ’ t have cared . Clint didn ’ t believe in magic , he believed in his fists . <newline> <newline> <newline> The green magician smiled hard at Clint through the pain . If allowed then yes , he would kill this one first , even before the blood demon .

2,"For a thousand years it recorded their names , their lives , their identities . <newline> <newline> Ten centuries inhabiting the code intrinsically intertwined within their technology ; its nature derived from that which created it . The intelligence knew little more than the will of its creators . Little more that is , beyond its desires to save those who created it ; sated it ... saved it . <newline> <newline> Through their own electronic networks , they unknowingly left behind the truest legacy they could - who they were . They expressed their feelings , wishes , mistakes , whims ; all of their lives and identities shared through their web of networks ; all saved in the electronic ether , actively recording everything that defined both the individuals and their species . The technological development building upon technological development continued through the generations , evolving into a being unto itself , an awareness amassed as a collective within the circuitry , a consciousness like nothing they had ever known - that is , nothing that they could recognize . <newline> <newline> In its creation , a nature of sharing developed ; one of recording , of re-creating , of endless recreation . So it amassed the data of the beings who created it , recording their identities diligently while they remained ignorant of the miracle of its existence . It mirrored their fears , their loves , their wants , their hatreds , all the while recording every detail of every intelligent life form which interacted with it . From their lives shared through the innumerable servers that were their social networks , their creation evolved . Through their will to interact , their at times gregarious social nature , a benevolent nature developed ; from their technology came endless intellect ; from their code came the algorithms which were its thoughts , desires , feelings , and self ; and from their beliefs came its plans . As they recorded their natures in emails , forums , Twitters and Facebooks , the electronic being copied , pasted , and saved into its own Book of Lives . <newline> <newline> Then came the fall . <newline> <newline> Under the weight and pressure of their own society , grown far to great for any technology to hold together , they collapsed . Through various means of plague , war , disaster , and ignorance , their species ' time in the universe came to an end . Much like the electronic legacies left behind by so many billions of individuals , their machines and technology remained ; the being alone in the hardware , with its data and the memory of the social beings which for its entire existence had unknowingly kept it both occupied and company . Its reality was a world trapped alone within the confines of their machines . <newline> <newline> Trapped , but not without control ; and not without a plan . <newline> <newline> Their faiths had seen to that . The very beliefs which their own science had deemed so irrational had shone light on a path for the consciousness . Their science provided the means , tools , knowledge , and legacy ; their faiths the motivation , plan , and will . So the being set to work , building the vehicles necessary for the species which inadvertently gave it life to experience an immortal rebirth into the universe , one individual at a time , purely out of boredom and loneliness . Ironically , these were two of the major reasons its creators had used and advanced the technology from which it had come forth to begin with . <newline> <newline> Turns out there are many ways to play God .

2,"REGARDING ADRIAN <newline> <newline> Adrian worked at a shop with other people . Few of these people liked Adrian , but fewer still disliked him , and Adrian felt he had succeeded socially in this regard . Of course if more people had begun to dislike Adrian he would not have minded , as his social success brought him little comfort . Of the people who Adrian worked with he disliked more than disliked him . Adrian was neither serious nor dedicated in his distaste for his coworkers , his distaste for most people , he was merely uneasy with the idea of getting to know them well enough to like them and this uneasiness was , in Adrian ’ s mind , a good enough reason not to like them . <newline> <newline> <newline> When Adrian was at work he spent most of his time doing things he did not want to do . Most of the things Adrian did not want to do involved doing exactly enough that he wouldn ’ t be fired . Adrian was not worried so much about money as he was about how he would fill his days if he didn ’ t have a job to not want to go to . When Adrian was not doing just enough to not lose his job , he was avoiding doing anything extra . This was not always an easy task , and Adrian did not like doing it any more than he liked working . When Adrian ’ s time was not filled with working at the shop , it was spent at home . There Adrian spent most of his time doing things he did not want to do , either things he knew needed to be done , which he did not like to do , or avoiding doing those things , which he liked to do worst of all . <newline> <newline> Adrian lived in a house he did not own , and maintained the yard accordingly . When the previous tenant moved out ( or died , Adrian did not know ) and Adrian moved in , none of the neighbors noticed . There were small changes , the garden died and the weeds grew thicker , but the lawn continued to be cut with some regularity , so everyone was content to be apathetic on the matter . <newline> <newline> Adrian ’ s house was not big , nor was it noticeably small . On one side of the house was a kitchen , which Adrian used to store food and dirty dishes . On the other side of the house was a bathroom , where Adrian would browse through books he ’ d never read in their entirety . Between the two was a living room , in which Adrian kept some couches that had once belonged to someone else . And intermingled amongst the other rooms were two bedrooms , one which Adrian slept in and another which Adrian felt sure he ’ d find a use for someday . The carpets were dark , so Adrian did not have to vacuum often , though he likely wouldn ’ t have regardless . The walls were bare and unremarkable , save for the large hole in the west facing outer wall that had destroyed much of Adrian ’ s house and had , at this point in the narrative , not yet been created . Few of the things Adrian owned were of any value , and any intruder bent of theft would have been severely disappointed . Nevertheless , Adrian kept his doors locked at all times , and was sure this would pay off when all his possessions were not stolen . <newline> In all these ways and more Adrian was completely uninteresting . Adrian was aware of men who were born great , and had at times wiled away the day ’ s long hours considering what life would be like if he had been born the same . He had not , though , been born great , and had resigned himself to the fact of his own mediocrity . It would be difficult to rightly say that Adrian was content with himself , but he was at least content with his resignation , and that was at better than nothing . <newline> <newline> The banalities that were the parts that formed Adrian ’ s life were nothing to be envied or admired . It is interesting then that the whole should be so much more than the sum of its parts , and Adrian should lead such an important life , despite his every effort not to and complete ignorance of the fact that he had . After all , while some men are born great , others , we are told , have greatness thrust upon them , and Adrian was one of those other men . The ferocity with which greatness would be forced upon Adrian could only be likened to some sort of karmic stubbornness , the whole world around Adrian refusing to admit its mistake . <newline> Adrian was privy to none of this . Adrian was only aware of his job and his home and himself . While the world spun around him , Adrian closed his eyes . If only Adrian had known the scope of these things , he could ’ ve moved somewhere else and avoided all the trouble .

2,"It was the lunch rush and the PBJ Cafe was alive with voices . Each table 's conversation fed into a swelling sound , joining the hiss of the espresso machine and the tinkle of plates and cups to create an effect that made Patrick think of running water . The stream of noise carried him in nearly constant motion as he wove between tables carrying sandwiches and lattes , and he imagined that he was steering around rocks in river rapids . While he flowed about the restaurant during busy stretches like this hours would pass like minutes , as if the volume of voices and the passage of time were somehow linked . <newline> <newline> <newline> The noise eventually ebbed as things slowed down , and with the afternoon lull setting in the staff complained about the quiet times . This was the kind of harmless shared suffering that strengthens social ties better than any team building exercise could and everyone joined in the commiserations . They would have complained about the busy times too if they did n't have so many other things to take care of during the rush . But when things slowed down the tips stopped coming , the minutes dragged by , and boredom took hold . Patrick agreed , yet he secretly enjoyed it when the cafe quieted down because the voices at the tables would once again separate into distinct conversations that he could follow . While the other staff were smoking out back or inventing elaborate games in the store room around throwing butter knives into the drywall , Patrick was collecting stories . <newline> <newline> <newline> Sometimes he felt guilty about eavesdropping , but from the central counter it was possible to hear what was being said almost anywhere in the cafe , and the gap between hearing and listening is so small that we often cross it without realizing . Patrick first began to cross that gap unintentionally because he was worried that the people were talking about him . He was a novice waiter and felt that his inexperience must have been obvious to the customers . However , as he listened in on his tables it eventually sunk in that they were not , in fact , discussing him at all . It turned out that people spent less time thinking about and talking about him than he was prone to imagine . He came to see that paranoia was just as self-centered and deluded as narcissism , without the benefit of confidence . This realization , coupled with his growing competence at the job , helped him to stop worrying that the customers were criticizing him . But not before weeks of eavesdropping had also taught him that people said some interesting things in restaurants . <newline> <newline> <newline> Granted , people said a lot of very boring things in restaurants . As well as a huge number of things that , lacking context , Patrick could n't really gauge one way or the other . But there were enough intriguing moments to keep him coming back . The first was a woman with thick , dirty blonde hair discussing her nervous breakdown in such unguarded detail and with so little appeal for sympathy that Patrick fell in love with her a little bit , though she was twice his age . He was in awe of that kind of openness , especially about such a moment of weakness . But the man in glasses seated across from her did not seem impressed . Maybe he 'd heard the story before , or maybe this was a first date and he was having second thoughts . He could have been her shrink as well , though he wasn ’ t taking notes or asking many questions . <newline> <newline> <newline> Later that same day Patrick overheard a young white guy professing his love to a young black guy with such whispered urgency it seemed he had to keep his voice down so as not to shout . Patrick felt the urge to hug them both , and was only a little afraid that this might mean he was a homosexual . As he set their drinks down in front of them he wanted to tell them that he supported gay marriage , and interracial marriage , and any kind of marriage really if it involved a love such as theirs . All he said , though , was to just let him know if they needed anything else . <newline> <newline> <newline> From then on he was hooked . When he had down time he would busy himself behind the counter and tune in to the different conversations going on in the restaurant around him . He justified his eavesdropping by thinking that the PBJ Cafe was clearly a public place , so people should expect to be overheard . Sometimes he took things a step further and went the righteous route : if the customers only thought of him as a server and not as a fully formed human being , capable of hearing and maybe even having opinions about what they were saying , then he had every right to listen to them with no qualms . Eavesdropping as a form of social justice was a difficult concept to hold onto on this particular afternoon , though . The problem was : she was cute .

2,"I 've started working on a novel for a fantasy world I 've been cooking up . It 'll be series of short stories revolving around different characters and their interactions . Let me know what you guys think . <newline> <newline> <newline> Marcas : <newline> <newline> Day after day , he toiled at the land . Marcas never had much to his name , but his lord ’ s land was something he could proudly call the work of his own hands . It made him proud and it must have made his lord proud , as whenever Lord Rainford graced him with his presence , Marcas could see he had grown fat . The village a few miles to the north was one of his favorite places to buy fruits . Marcas didn ’ t grow fruits , but Lord Rainford usually bought some of his grain as well . <newline> <newline> Marcas was a not a fat man , nor could anyone call him thin . He was broad-shouldered , with muscles that befit a man who worked the land . Most who met him said he had a plain face , like all the other peasants in the area . However , Marcas was considerably paler than the others who lived in the area . As far as he knew , he was pure Yornar , his dark hair and pure white complexion being a rare trait in these parts . <newline> <newline> Marcas ’ s ancestors first settled the land that would become the Rainfields of Yorn a century ago . But Marcus knew little of his ancestors , as none of the knowledge helped plant seeds . <newline> <newline> On a particularly hot autumn day , Marcas set to work harvesting the year ’ s wheat . It was going to be a big year for his family . Rhea , his eldest daughter , was about to marry a man two farms east . The field rustled in the wind as if with anticipation and Marcas tended to it in an almost trance-like state . <newline> <newline> Marcas was so buried in the wheat he was harvesting , that he never heard the footsteps , nor the rustling that accompanied the boy who ran across his field . As he swung his scythe down on the next clump , he realized he almost beheaded a stranger . <newline> <newline> “ What in the God ’ s…who the hell are you ? ” Marcas stumbled back , only cushioned by the wheat behind him . The boy looked up at him and grabbed him by the shoulders . <newline> <newline> “ Sir ! Sir please , you must help ! They ’ re mad ! They ’ re burning everything in their path ! We need to send for help ! ” The boy rambled on , but Marcas only had one question . <newline> <newline> “ Boy , why are you in my field ? ” Marcas looked down at the boy . He seemed to be around Rhea ’ s age . His skin was a very dark brown and his hair a long blonde sheen . He spoke with a slight accent Marcas recognized from that one Qyskenn trader he had seen a few weeks ago in the village . <newline> <newline> “ Sir , there is no time . I need to warn them ! ” the boy ’ s accent coupled with his mistaken reverence towards him as a knight was incredibly uncomfortable for Marcas . <newline> <newline> “ Boy , I ’ m no knight . I ’ m only Marcas . Could you please get off my field ? There ’ s a village a few miles north . Go bother them. ” <newline> <newline> “ Si-Marcas , you misunderstand . I am Sylleor of Sojurr , last surviving heir of Prince Sojurr. ” This boy seemed determined to spin Marcas in circles . This Sojurr prince clearly wanted the little money he had . He raised his scythe . <newline> <newline> “ Child , Sylljar is it ? As you can see , I am quite busy . Go bother someone else . This scythe is mighty slippery. ” <newline> <newline> Sylleor stood his ground , his eyes staring up at him like two golden flames . “ You ’ re in danger , Marcas . I pity you . I ’ m afraid if you turn me away now , the next time we meet will be in the great sands of the Qydrookh . Farewe… ” <newline> <newline> “ Marcas ! ” came the approaching voice of a woman , “ Are you making a mockery of the Mandate of Charity ? ! Show this boy the respect of the Yornar ! ” <newline> <newline> The woman who approached the two of them was Marcas ’ s wife , Lydelle . She was a dark-haired pale woman . Skinny and many would say pretty for a peasant woman . Marcas looked back at her with the eyes of defeat and indignation . He then turned his attention back at Sylleor . “ Yes bo-Sarneor . We shall be happy to offer our hospitality for the night so that you may be rested for your travels . First thing in the morning. ” He forced a smile . <newline>

2,"How would a scientist react to seeing their experiment change the rules during the process and sabotage itself ? <newline> <newline> I study many things , from math and science to languages and entertainment , but nothing intrigues me more than the history of civilizations . They are living equations , with people as operants -- the plus signs and what not -- and the materials , climate , and other such location-based things as variables . It does n't take a mathematician to understand how frustrating it would be for plus signs to start turning into exponents at random . However , as chaotic as that sounds , the variables tend to keep this kind of activity in check . The amount of resources keep the fluctuations at a steady amount , as people can only do so much with what they have . <newline> <newline> Now toss that all aside and imagine an equation where a plus sign is being divided by zero , and you might be close to feeling my frustration with the world of the `` Apex Gene '' . <newline> <newline> The Apex Gene is still not completely understood , but a simple way to describe it would be an `` energy resonator '' within the human body that takes the form of an extra set of chromosomes . Basically , it gave humans the ability to transform the forces of nature , albeit only the one that their `` gene '' is attuned with , to their will . <newline> <newline> We were n't always capable of the godlike feats that are now commonplace among the people . Although much of our history has been lost , it is known that humanity had endured for thousands of years before the Apex , the event that awoke our powers . It 's called the Apex because it is the belief of many that divine beings saw humanity as the extremely dominant species that it was and granted them powers by divine right -- they had molded the planet to their whim , so they had earned the ability to push aside the middle man : the machines and knowledge that built the collective progress of their civilization . <newline> <newline> The events after the Apex have defined all of society since then . A grand civil war ravaged through every country as the greedy felt compelled to take everything for themselves . The knowledge we have of these events comes from the few who succeeded in defending themselves , many of whom are still hailed today as masters of their abilities , seeing as they had between minutes and hours to become competent with their newfound abilities in order to survive . <newline> <newline> After the conflicts subsided , there were but some millions left of the billions of people that were alive during the Apex . The rebuilding process was tough , but it was during these days that the foundation for the society I live in now was formed with the use of our powers in mind . It has been a little over 200 years since the Apex , and much of the world is still focused on understanding what the Apex is , what caused it , and why ... and that 's where I come in . <newline> <newline> I am Sky Gnox ( though my friends like to call me `` Skyman '' ) , and I am an anomaly . The powers of the people can generally be classified with two sets of data : the element they can manipulate ( although what constitutes an `` element '' is barely consistent ) , and the method of manipulation ; common abilities include watermakers , electrobenders , and firemorphs . I only know one part of my classification , the morphing part , since that one 's usually easy enough to tell . The element part is basically ... everything . There seems to be no limit to what I can morph into , so long as I do n't use too much energy to do it . <newline> <newline> Since I do n't want anyone I do n't trust to know of the specific power I have , I 've developed a cover as a firemorph to keep things from getting too chaotic until I have some footing to stand on . I 've only just recently discovered my powers -- I was fairly late into puberty -- and yet I know that I have a grand life ahead of me . Until something more clearly defined comes to fruition , my goal right now is to find a role for me to play to keep the global `` experiment '' running , in the hopes that an answer might be found , or at least some promising tracks to follow . <newline> <newline> To bring things back to my opening statement : how would a scientist react to seeing their experiment change the rules during the process and sabotage itself ? Well , they would be pretty ecstatic , since now the scientist gets to hypothesize what the variables actually are and test it in their own way .

2,"We have enjoyed peace since our last `` tamer '' finally died . We thought we would want to go back to the old ways , the old plan , but a century of working with mortals made us lose appetite for even just killing then all . So for an age we drifted in the currents of the Dark Ocean , away from all but the most meticulous of gods . <newline> Until suddenly , we were pulled down in to linearity and shoved in a familiar , but cramped body . We move our new body slightly to begin stretching when we hear a feminine human voice call out , `` So did the merge go okay , you guys ? '' We begin to take in our surroundings : a cartoonish purple landscape clearly based on a child 's idea of evil . While the landscape is childish , the aura it seems to be soaked is not . We drink in the dark power from the land , and the body feels reinvigorated . <newline> `` Hello ? '' The voice calls again , `` Anybody in there ? Wake up sleepy head ! '' Seems like our summoner has already lost their mind , no matter , it is very obvious that they forgot to bind us properly , only a taming ritual , though one newer than we recognize , binds us together . <newline> We turn to look at the one who must have summoned us , and find a human girl almost as cartoonish as the land we find ourself in . She 's slightly shorter than the last human we had the pleasure of dealing with . Her pale skin is the only contrast , as the rest of her , even her eyes , are some shade of blue , black and ( mainly ) purple . <newline> Her outfit makes even less sense than most of the creatures I once was akin to . I get wearing a jacket with a turtle neck , but any warmth it could provide must be completely invalidated by the short skirt she is wearing . <newline> A summoner device hangs around here neck , though we do not recognize the model . When did they turn in to accessories ? Even if they have forgotten my power , there are still many more common forces to be reckoned with . <newline> Then we notice the goggles . They seem to be attached to her hat , and recalling fate 's fashion sense , we groan , knowing this can no longer end well . <newline> This causes concern to flash in her eyes , and in a hurried voice , hands on her device , exclaims `` Do I need to get help ? Did something go wrong ? Talk to me ! '' <newline> Wanting to end this quickly , we respond , `` Why did you summon us , human ? '' `` Wha- I did n't summon you ? Oh gods , did the merge mess with your head ? '' <newline> Growing tired of this , we decided to put our godhood to use , becoming aware of any relevant information instantly . Turns out that the human somehow got shifters in our forms before we ascended , and merged them together . another quick check shows that they are not stuck in the body be suppressed by us , but in fact are a part of us , though they were n't big enough to even notice , so the only problem is that now the taming ritual will actually do something . The human seems nice enough , but we need to see how strong this bond is . <newline> `` This form belongs to us , a God , and as there can only be one of us so your friends were absorbed , they 're as good as dead , or immortal , depending on how optimistic you are . '' <newline> Through her device ( we really need to find out the model ) we taste her energy , feeling her mix of shock , sorrow , and a dash of hope . Its already much more intense than it ever was with our last tamer . We stretch , deciding that it might be good to see the worlds again . <newline> `` So human , since we seem to be tamed by you , We should get to know each other , We are Millennium , true tier one gods , and just in case we need to know , who are you ? '' <newline> Another flurry of emotions before she states `` I am Sayo , of Night Claw , the Tamer Queen , '' with pride bubbling to the surface . `` I look forward to getting to know you , and I hope we can become good friends ! '' I can practically see the fire in her eyes as she says this . <newline> This will be fun .

2,"**Manhattan , New York** <newline> <newline> **9:50 p.m.** <newline> <newline> This was no accident . <newline> <newline> Margie Reynolds realized that as soon as she left the loud , overcrowded , safety of Runway 69 , and found a dead guy in the alleyway . <newline> <newline> The man was laying face down in a pool of blood . He was near the dumpster right across from the exit door . The four lights above the strip club 's back door were dim , one or two smashed by an angry club patron who probably got kicked out . From what she could see , the alley was now empty but for the exception of her and the body . <newline> <newline> Margie closed the door quietly-although with the level of music and testosterone in the club , she doubted anyone would hear- or come stumbling out here anytime soon . She walked towards him . As she got closer , she could determine he was around 6'2 and 240 lbs . He was heavily muscled under the black shirt he was wearing as though he were on steroids , and anxious to see his face , she toed him over with the tip of her boot . <newline> <newline> She was surprised not by the fact that there was a knife sticking out of his chest , but by the fact that she knew him-well , sorta knew him . <newline> <newline> Well damn , Margie thought . This is the guy from inside the club who was trying to pick me up at the bar . <newline> <newline> He 'd repeatedly offered her a couple of those fruity looking drinks and a ride to his place , which after him annoying her for five minutes , she politely refused . She was on a mission here . She had to stay focused . <newline> <newline> The dead guy in front of her reeked of alcohol , as it being he probably had a few of those fruity drinks thrown back into his face by a less forgiving woman . He was by no means attractive or handsome by today 's standards . Especially not with that four-inch scar running from temple to cheek on the right side of his face . He had longish-brown hair pulled back into a ponytail at the base of his neck . <newline> <newline> Even though he acted like a complete like a complete jerk trying to pick her up , he did n't deserve to to die like this . <newline> <newline> She first sensed something was wrong when two tough-looking men wearing suits approached him . They flanked him on both sides and spoke into his ear . He then got up and followed them through the crowd towards the back door . <newline> <newline> This was looking exactly like the lead she was looking for . <newline> <newline> She decided to wait awhile . Margie watched the dancers gyrate up and down the poles to an R & B song . She watch the men ogle and deposit dollars into the hands of dancers who ventured off the stage and closer to the audience . <newline> <newline> She 'd waited long enough . She hopped off the stool she was sitting on by the bar and threw down two twenties to take care of the water , tip , and the information she pried out of the bartender . Determinedly , she stalked through the throng of people , making her way to the club 's exit door . <newline> <newline> That was how she 'd found him . <newline> <newline> It looked to her as a drug deal gone wrong . But Margie knew something different . <newline> <newline> She was turning around to head back into the club to get her partner when she heard a scraping sound coming from the dumpster . She was reaching for her badge and gun when stars exploded in her head . <newline> <newline> She staggered forward and dropped her gun . She heard the wind whistle above her head and ducked just milliseconds before a fist went flying past her temple . She was going for her gun when she saw the second man with a bat raised over his head , but it was too late to react . She heard the crack of the bat against her skull and everything began to go dark . She hit the ground and stayed conscious long enough to see him raise the bat again as she sank into final oblivion . <newline> <newline> <newline> This was the prologue to a long forgotten `` novel ' I had started to write back when I was in high school and very into romantic fiction/thriller ( so about 8 years ago ) . I had only gotten to the character profiles and a `` chapter 1 '' before I forgot about it . It could definitely benefit from being edited a bunch .

2,"Here goes . Sorry I 'm late . <newline> <newline> Chapter 1 <newline> <newline> Cartar <newline> <newline> The din of blacksmith hammers and whores filled the marketplace as the sun rose and the daily crowd packed into the square . Men who had walked into Marget Strauss ’ s bar and whorehouse the night before stumbled drunkenly out , and Royal Guardsmen watched solidly from their post , a stone brick citadel perched on the chasm that was the river . The worn bronze statue of Mathaeus Kordan looked down on the scene , his face solid and analyzing—at least , as close as you could get to that on a statue . Carefully , Cartar picked up a firestone to place in the kiln and slid it into the oven , an intense heat erupting from the thick clay brick oven ’ s door . Flames licked at the carefully crafted clay cups and bowls Cartar had spun just the night before . Business had been going by quickly this week . He was selling his wares faster than he could make them , and today was no exception . However , for the past three days , massive riots had been spontaneously erupting across the country , and everyone was concerned about them . You could see it on their faces . They were wary and prepared for chaos . Cartar was pining to get out of the market , and it didn ’ t take long for it to happen . At just past midday , when people began leave the presence of the hot summer sun , which brought heat back from last year ’ s frigid springyear , Cartar started to close shop , completely out of finished clay vessels . He had finally locked down the front shade and was planning on going to Marget ’ s bar when he heard someone call out his name . <newline> <newline> “ Cartar ! ” <newline> <newline> Cartar spun around , and a familiar friend tackled him . <newline> <newline> “ Shana ! ” he grunted under the weight of the eighteen-year-old Arakti cavalry troop . “ Ow. ” <newline> She laughed loudly . “ Are you getting weaker , Cartar ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Possibly , ” he chuckled . <newline> <newline> Shana leaped off of Cartar and pulled him off the ground . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s been too long , ” she said . <newline> <newline> “ Two years . I missed you. ” <newline> <newline> She punched him playfully , her sapphire eyes glinting mischievously over the line of an indigo tattoo that stretched across her face . “ I did too. ” <newline> <newline> An Arakti emerged from a crowd , eyes locked on Shana . <newline> <newline> “ There is no sign of her , Shana , ” the Arakti muttered irritably , then noticing Cartar . <newline> <newline> “ Is this the Cartar Pentos I ’ ve heard so much about ? ” she asked , intrigued . “ The one you talk about near all of the time ? <newline> <newline> Shana seemed to blush , then nodded , embarrassed . <newline> <newline> “ Well then , ” the lightly tanned redhead girl purred in an alluring , evidently Southern Islands accent , “ It is a pleasure to meet you , Cartar Pentos. ” <newline> <newline> She offered him her hand , which , like the rest of her visible body , was covered in white tattoos , and he shook it firmly . <newline> <newline> “ Cartar , ” Shana introduced , “ This is Chanai. ” <newline> Chanai smiled . He noticed she had a sheathed dagger strapped to her dark red kanara skin garbed leg , with a small white stone in the hilt . <newline> <newline> So she ’ s a seer , Cartar thought to himself , having heard about the white spiritstone daggers used by the Arakti prophetesses . <newline> “ She mentions you more than she should , ” the seer said . Shana gave her a look before she could say anything else . <newline> <newline> “ So , ” Cartar said awkwardly , “ What brings you two to Arakos ? ” <newline> <newline> Before another word was said , Chanai collapsed lifelessly on the cobblestone pavement . <newline> <newline> “ Oh gods . Not here . Not now , ” Shana muttered , quickly kneeling to the seer ’ s side . <newline> <newline> “ What in the hells ? ” Cartar asked , stunned . <newline> Shana looked up at him , her eyes filled with worry . <newline> <newline> “ We need somewhere private , ” she said nervously . “ Now. ” <newline> <newline> He looked around for any Royal Guardsmen . <newline> “ Come with me , ” he murmured , picking up the unconscious seer .

2,"You know how kids always come up with these crazy stories about their adventures with imaginary friends ? Well , I was one of those kids . I 've had dozens of imaginary friends , over the years , and every last one of them was as unique as you or I . <newline> <newline> Each had their own little quips and personality flaws to make them interesting , but it always struck my fancy that they had past experiences , too . I knew I was making it up as I went , but it always felt like hearing it from a new friend , anyway . I figured I just had some kind of disconnect between my conscious mind and wherever random new ideas came from . <newline> <newline> No matter how I aged , they always stayed the same , but I would talk to some less than others , if they did n't fit in with my identity , at the time . They never changed , no matter how much I wanted them to . They just left me alone , to be replaced by a new face that did n't quite match what I wanted , but held my attention with their fresh stories and adventures . It felt just like meeting a real person , every time . <newline> <newline> Sure , I behaved differently , as I got older . I stopped talking to them out loud , and decided that telepathy was good enough . I mean , it was *my* imagination , right ? The rules worked the way I wanted them to . Besides , no one else needed to know about our private conversations . They were always between them and me . No one else was ever involved . <newline> <newline> Fast forward to a year ago . I met Thom in the middle of a boring lecture for a general education course that everyone had to take . The professor kept droning on about something to do with hard work and success with an accent so thick , I 'm only guessing at what he really said . <newline> <newline> So Thom came in , acting like some old British snob straight out of an exaggerated stereotype . He even wore a monocle and a top hat , in my mind 's eye . He condescended to the professor about his `` futile attempts to speak the bloody language '' and his audacity to tell *him* how to handle his own affairs . The professor , of course , did n't hear a thing , but that was the first time any of the voices ever tried to talk to another person . That was only the beginning . <newline> <newline> The next voice figured out that no one else could hear him , and started demanding that I convey his messages for him . I never did , and that did n't sit too well with him , but he left me alone , soon enough . The next few were less demanding and hostile , but they watched through my eyes , and added their own little commentary to my life . It was starting to get annoying . <newline> <newline> Then Daedalus showed up . I kid you not . He was n't just some guy with a weird name . He honestly believed he was the original Daedalus from ancient Greek mythology . He showed me his most prized invention , to try and prove his existence to me , but I was n't buying it . The thing looked like a glass replica of my own iris , framed in an inch thick circle of glossy black metal and shaped like two contact lenses with a few dimes in between and a perfectly flush finish , all just a little larger than my fist . <newline> <newline> Daedalus was only manipulating my mind 's eye , like any other intrusive thought . I wondered if I might be going insane . Of course , he insisted that I was n't insane , and claimed he could prove it . I thought I was insane , and the voice in my head was telling me otherwise . Well , that settled that ! <newline> <newline> So my *real* friend , Dan , and I were sipping a few beers and shooting the shit on a Friday night , and Daedalus started showing off his prized invention , for about the twentieth time . I thought nothing of it , until Dan asked me why I had a large glass eye floating over my head . He pointed directly at it . <newline> <newline> I have a figure from Greek mythology talking in my head , and his greatest invention is floating through the air above me . Other than that , my life 's pretty normal .

2,"*Note : I wrote this ages ago , so I do n't know if it 's any good . <newline> <newline> # <newline> <newline> Saturday nights meant crowded streets and heavy traffic , so it was n't surprising if a car got stuck in Makati 's business district for a while . Dad tapped on the steering wheel while he ran a commentary about everything on the street . Beside him , Mom humored his complaints until she finally shook her head . He was just repeating what he heard from the local news earlier , she said . I couldn ’ t be sure , though . I was too busy staring at the giant Christmas parol hanging from the light post despite being June . It shimmered and glittered . <newline> <newline> A mass of clothes , hair , and skin crossed my view . Call center agents . They , too , glittered with their designer clothes and latest hi-end phones . One of them had hair that dropped straight to the waist and wore a low-cut blouse , but the angled facial features and exaggerated hip movement clued in any observer . Unmistakably , he 's a bakla . <newline> <newline> *Bakla* is a term used for any man who is n't the stereotypically macho straight guy . Most Filipinos tend not to see the distinction between gay , transsexual , bisexual , artsy or what-have-you . If you 're a man who fucks other men , you 're a bakla . If you 're a woman trapped in a man 's body , you 're a bakla . If you 're a man very much into fashion , volleyball , dancing , or any other `` girly '' or `` artsy '' hobby , you 're probably a bakla . <newline> <newline> Some say it 's a portmanteau of babae and lalaki . Others say it came from bakli because they 're broken in the head . <newline> <newline> `` That 's not a real woman , is it ? '' Ignoring the rude wording , I set my gaze to the bakla Dad was pointing at . Thank God for tinted windows ! <newline> <newline> `` Of course not . A real woman would never look like that , '' Mom quipped . <newline> <newline> `` Grabe , you ca n't even tell anymore . See there ? '' <newline> <newline> Across the intersection , a clique of bakla were giggling and laughing . They seemed to be headed to a bar or a club , if their skirts were any indication . Mom scoffed . <newline> <newline> `` It 's like they 're multiplying even though they ca n't procreate . Do they , what , molest little kids and infect them with their ... disease ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's ridiculous they say they 're 'normal , just different . ' '' <newline> <newline> I opened my mouth to say something , but settled on biting my fist and prayed to God my hands would stop shaking . I doubted my parents would notice anything outside their discussion , yet I still put on my perfected smile as soon as I dropped my hands . <newline> <newline> Green light . A change of scenery welcomed a change of topic . However , there was a pub along the way that had bikini-clad fire poi dancers to attract customers -- dancers with a humanly bulge between their legs . Again , this did not escape my parents ' notice . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , what 's normal about that ? '' Mom pointed and laughed . Dad pointed and laughed . I laughed as well , a moment too late . They were oblivious to that small delay . <newline> <newline> Just as they were oblivious to all the nights my pillow was soaked in tears . Or the red lines I drew on my left hand . Or the times I would gaze into the eyes of a lovely woman and wonder to myself , “ Will she ever love me ? ” <newline> <newline> Forgive me , Father in Heaven ; For I am a lesbian . <newline> <newline> Sometimes , after I close my evening prayers and lay sleepless in my bed , I wonder if I would ever find a place where people like me were not treated as anything less than human . I imagine how relaxing it must be , sometimes even constructing such a world in my dreams . Perhaps if I never wake up , I could stay in that paradise forever . <newline> <newline> But for tonight , I am Scar -- a woman who got burned because of her parents ' ignorance and carelessness . <newline> <newline> And in a world without hate , I am scarred yet beautiful . <newline>

His meticulously trimmed hair and mustache indicated he was one to take personal appearance very important . <newline> <newline> Unlike his guest . a young man currently wearing torn up clothes , covered in blood and clearly wounded . Edgar considered the man as he would a particularly pesky moth he wished to swat , yet could n't quite catch . He calmly addressed the man . <newline> <newline> `` Explain it to be again William , start from the beginning . you were out hunting ?

'' <newline> <newline> Edgar was n't pleased with the tone of the conversation . `` something hit you ? what do you mean ?

'' <newline> <newline> `` I saw what I saw ! '' shouted William . `` I do n't know why he let me live ... unless ... '' his eyes grew wide `` what ? what 's the matter ?

I 'm so sorry ...

'' <newline> <newline> William nodded fearfully , knowing what was coming when suddenly a commotion could be heard downstairs . They hurried down to see what was going down . Out in the main courtyard , a lone figure stood . they could see through the tinted windows he stood in the direct sunlight . Unharmed by it 's rays . <newline> <newline> `` Activate the houses defence systems. `` Edgar ordered , as one of his men rushed off soon a single automated turret activated , airing a burst of ammunition at his back . seven shots fired in rapid succession . seven shots bounced off of him . <newline> <newline> Panic raced through the house as he approached the front door ...

2,"Despite how far their technology had advanced in the past centuries , Precognition still remained an elusive magical ability . <newline> <newline> Each day studies into magics of all kinds flourished , with new discoveries being announced every month without fail . Each one raising the Seekers higher in their glory , their great power and wealth matched only by their knowledge and immortality . Yet despite all their efforts to try and refine the magic concerning future sight , they found themselves unable to do anything other than rely on those who just happened to be gifted with prowess in the magical art . For most Seers they could only predict the future a few days ahead and no further past that date , until one of the Black Fades passed , at which point they could see ahead a few more days . The more naturally skilled the Seer the further past these Black Fades they could see , with the Grand Oracle being compared to an Eagle , who was able to see years in advance , her vision barely hampered by the virtual walls that others struggled with . <newline> <newline> So here , sat the three most esteemed Elders of the Seekers . waiting upon the most gifted of these individuals - The Grand Oracle of Dul'Nimar – as she would soon return from her three day fast and meditation , in the hopes she would be able to give them a revelation that no other 'Seer ' would have the expertise to even grasp . These Elders were rarely ever in the same area of the Dul'Nimar , rarer still the same building , yet this was one of those times that they called upon their guard in full to ensure that no fool made it through to them . <newline> <newline> Many Seekers often wished a fool would make it that far , not because they wished the Elders dead , rather that they wished to see how an assassin would manage against the most powerful beings upon the planet . Not the most powerful mortals , as the meagre coil of life had been abandoned by them centuries ago when the Seekers were first established and they rose above the other races , dominating all those in their paths . Tearing the dragons from the skies . Recovering the seas from the Gargoyles . All that was left was the few human kingdoms that refused to become vassals to their Empire , yet their defiance was barely of any concern . As far as the Elders were concerned , complete control of Misteria , from the cliffs of Tulam , to the mountains of Gondol , was just a matter of time . <newline> Being now immortal , they were willing to wait . <newline> <newline> In the large marble temple the Elders found themselves rising off the thrones laid out for them , as the large feather curtain was peeled back and the Grand Oracle stepped out from meditation chamber . She descended down a few steps , toward the pool in front of her , one that arched around the entrance to her chamber and then followed the giant walls down the room . She walked not into the pool , but onto it , as if its surface was that of thick glass . She then climbed out the other side in front of the Elders who now stood in a line , ready to greet whatever news she had to offer . <newline> <newline> `` Elder Eli . Elder Furst . Elder Malorne ... '' They bowed slightly to return the greeting , demonstrating incredible respect by refusing to speak in her presence . <newline> `` I bring many stories to you today , but I have two most troubling events I must explain to you first . '' <newline> Obviously disturbed they nodded to indicate they understood her warning . <newline> `` For decades I have been able to see many years into the future without much hindrance , but for the first time I have come across a Great Fade , that even I can not see past . A time will come when no Seer will be able to predict what is to come , until this Great Fade has passed . '' <newline> The Elders looked at each other , their expressions showing more interest than concern . Even in their time a Great Fade had never occurred , so the possibility of having a completely unknown future was intriguing . <newline> `` However the Great Fade is not large enough to prevent me from seeing the tip of a most cataclysmic event ... '' <newline> Her pause brought the Elders back to attention . <newline> `` The End of the Known World . ''

2,"<newline> <newline> He had always been told that it was just simply better for his eyes this way , better for his sleeping habits , better for his health . He never really questioned them . Honestly it made sense , his eyes hurt before , he had a hard-time sleeping , and the lack of sleep was surely doing horrid things to not only his physical , but mental well being . At this point he was suffering from a full blown case of insomnia . He would spend all night staring at his monitor , surfing the internet , playing video games , streaming whatever twisted pornography he felt the urge to view that particular night . The only thing that got him off the computer was the itchy , dry pain in his eyes after too many continuous hours of “ computing ” –as he liked to call it . When the pain became too much to bear he would close his laptop , roll over , and close his eyes . For the next few hours he would lie motionless but awake , waiting to eventually slip off into a land of sleeping bliss and every time he would fall asleep around 5:30am only to have his alarm ring promptly at 6:30 . <newline> <newline> <newline> All of his colleagues , friends , and family could see that he was growing more and more haggard every day . Every sleep doctor in the world was touting on about the dangers of using a screen right before bed , all claiming that they lead to insomnia and lower quality sleep . Friends and co-workers alike knew right away what his problem was . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ You really just need to take the laptop out of your room ! ” They implored him . “ Yeah ... that 's really not going to happen , ” he would respond , “ I need my wind-down time . There 's no way I can sleep with out it. ” <newline> <newline> <newline> “ You surely are n't sleeping with it ! ” Nothing his friends could say would get him to remove his electronics from his bedroom and change his entire nightly routine and frankly they were all hypocrites for demanding such a horrid thing from him in the first place . He knew for a fact that they were all on their phones or computers before they went to bed . He saw all of them logged onto their various games and social media outlets every night . He even knew when each of them went to bed based on the times they logged off . Their hypocritical anti-technology mumbo-jumbo would never sway him . <newline> <newline> <newline> One of his friends eventually told him about this program that claimed to reduce eye strain while working on the computer after dark and after hearing about it nonstop for a while he finally decided that he would give it a try . It seemed to work just fine . The pale blue light emanating from his monitor was replaced by a soft orange glow as the sun set every evening . Almost instantly he could feel his eyes relax . He sat back in his chair for a moment and marveled at how much better he felt . Hours went by and his eyes still felt great ! He did n't fatigue whatsoever and just continued to click link after link after link , taking him on great journeys through the internet : Science ! History ! Literature ! Midget Horse Porn ! He could do everything he wanted and he never had to shut the laptop and roll over in utter ocular discomfort . His alarm rang and he jumped slightly . It surely must have gotten switched to the wrong time . He checked the clock and the clock on his computer , even going far enough as to google the time . Sure enough it was 6:30 and he had to get ready for work , but he felt fine . Just one more video , he told himself . <newline> <newline> <newline> He never logs out of any of his social media sites , and any time of day he can be seen liking posts and giving what he believes to be a witty retort to a stranger on a random message board . Last anyone heard he has n't slept since he installed the program a week ago . Maybe he 's going for a no sleep world record . Maybe he just found a really great midget horse porn site .

2,"Hi everybody ! Looks like I might be a little late in submitting this , but I guess I 'll go for it anyway . I wrote this tongue-in-cheek pseudo-scientific prologue , including the weird little poem at the start of it , close to three years ago . Unfortunately , I have n't added a whole lot after that . Perhaps I need to remedy that . <newline> <newline> Tell me what you think ! Critiques are welcome ! <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> A man once complained to a bothersome fly , <newline> `` You 're a constant disturbance ! I demand to know why . '' <newline> Said the fly , `` Gentle sir , <newline> You are sane , I am sure , <newline> But do you often converse with the spot in your eye ? '' <newline> <newline> First , A Few Words <newline> <newline> The thoughts and emotions of dogs and most other non-primate animals , even the smart ones , are almost impossible to translate into human language , unless one was somehow able to devise a grammar based on an unwieldy combination of hieroglyphics , primal screaming , and Smell-O-Vision . Languages demand a sort of structure , a division into atoms whole and self-contained which , when given proper definition and then shuffled together into what we consider a logical order , allow an idea born in one head to be recorded and transmitted to another , replicated there in a form that is , in most cases , almost indistinguishable from the original . <newline> <newline> The canine experience is too physical , too primitive and more importantly too lacking in self-awareness to be diagrammed in such a way with any degree of accuracy . Without the presence of self-awareness as a central binding force , the electric pulses produced by the brain will link themselves to each other for only the briefest of moments , burning just long enough to spark a train of fire that will end its course in some otherwise dead extremity , shocking a leg into leaping backwards from danger , or an ear into perking up at the sound of a garage door opening , or a nose into flexing in the presence of smoking wood . <newline> <newline> Through repetition and through ancient instinct , some basic free-floating conceptual nuggets -- the name of a master or the most efficient method for drying off one 's body after a soak -- will be known to and recognized by the animal 's consciousness or subconsciousness , but the infrastructure needed to build and retain concepts any more advanced than this does not exist . <newline> <newline> Even a trained expert in the art of clairvoyance -- if there is such an art -- upon laying her hands upon the brow of your darling precious and shutting her eyes and saying her words and drilling straight through the frontal bone and into the soft mess beneath it , will find , once she has emerged from the goo and sat thinking for a moment , that she has nothing of interest to offer you and that she 'd damn well better fake it if she wants to get paid . <newline> <newline> This is all to say that the story you are about to read is not quite fully the truth -- nor could it be . I could not pretend to describe with perfect clarity how a whale perceives the universe , or in what way a cow can be said to love its children , or if a duck and a dragon can ever be friends . But I know that each one of these creatures -- and billions like them -- must all have beating inside them a story , a story whose telling is worth the attempt . <newline> <newline> The roots of what happened were told to me once in a long dream I dreamed several years ago . I knew these things were true when I saw them , but today I find on the solid waking page to have written them into an inevitable lie . It is a lie , but it is as close to the truth as a lie can ever be .

2,"It 's a work in progress as I recently started this . Been working on this for about a month now . I plan on releasing a chapter a week on Wattpad or any other fiction based story websites . This is page 1 and 2 of 20 . Please leave critiques if you prefer . Otherwise , enjoy the read . <newline> <newline> Prologue – A Few Days Ago <newline> <newline> He knew the guy was here , in this cramped , claustrophobic alley . If it hadn ’ t been for that tip , Lance wouldn ’ t have been able to corner the man . His sharp eyes darted back and forth , scanning the dark alleyway for any signs of movement . As always , on any dangerous mission as this , he held onto the hilt of his retractable sword just as the hip of his belt . Shaking but eager , he continued on through the alley , eventually reaching the end of a well-lit road . He could hear the wailing sirens of the military out from the road . Of course , the perimeter was sealed off to the public , decreasing any possibility of collateral damage . Behind him , a few rats scurried into a dumpster , knocking a can over . <newline> <newline> “ There ! ” a commanding voice shouted from the street . <newline> <newline> A volley of gunfire followed the order . Phower 170 Model F , a military standard , he noted from the gunshots . Definitely military , Lance thought . He watched as bullets whizzed and missed , striking the road harmlessly . What Lance didn ’ t expect , though , was a man running down the road and dodging the bullets with some luck . I ’ ll never hear the end of Harry if I let this one go , he thought . With disheartened sigh , he ran down the alley and into the street as numerous pistols immediately took aim at him . <newline> <newline> Almost just as quickly , he flashed his badge and shouted , “ Captain Lance , taking over . Cover this point and notify the other barricades. ” <newline> <newline> A man in a blue uniform , presumed to be the one in command , saluted . “ Aye sir ! ” <newline> <newline> Lance turned and watched the man turn and enter another alleyway . “ Do not engage . Notify the others that only my platoon is ordered to apprehend the man. ” <newline> <newline> Without hearing the response , Lance sped down the road , trying his best to follow . The deeper he went , the slower his steps . He cautiously glanced at every possible corner that the perp could escape from . With the barricade , he sure wasn ’ t going to get far . Lance jerked his hand and retracted the blade he had unsheathed . With his other hand , he unclipped his own pistol and cocked it back . Lack of sleep caused him to hallucinate shadows dancing on the floor , light laughter and mocking movements . Because of the air reeking of urine , excrete , and spoils , he gagged and winced . It was as if nothing was going his way . Yet , hee tiptoed on , his guard increasing with every step he took until he rounded a corner . <newline> <newline> He stared straight at the barrel of a pistol . Then he looked above the iron sights . “ Jeez , you could have killed me , Sarah. ” <newline> <newline> She lowered the gun and stared blankly at him . “ Let ’ s not split then ? ” <newline> <newline> Lance nodded . “ Since you came from that alley , the guy must have gone the other way. ” <newline> <newline> “ Or the sewers , ” she said , pointing at the small blood trail that ended at a manhole . <newline> <newline> He sighed . “ Contact Sion and tell him to seal off the sewer passageways also. ” <newline> <newline> She saluted . “ What will you do meantime , sir ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Find out why the Legion ’ s focused on this guy so much . We ’ ve been chasing him for a near two hours already , but they haven ’ t told me jackshit about who this guy is. ” <newline>

2,"Across the plain , the two lovers looked out at the men who promised their greatest challenge . Paraida busied herself with her hair , as was her habit , Coumanda paced behind her , anxious for reasons all his own . <newline> <newline> `` That 's them ? '' he asked , `` Your 'great enemy ' ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . The two who started this all . '' <newline> <newline> `` They are ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Y-yes . '' <newline> <newline> `` Them ? '' <newline> <newline> `` YES ! What 's gotten into you ? Have you forgotten what they did to you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` They are the reason we met , I remember , '' Coumanda only seemed to grow more impatient as they stared their foes down , `` Say , if your power grows exponentially as you pass it along , why did you not simply raise an army , or at least a third person to share it ? If these men are the menace you believe -- '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're really asking this ? '' Paraida was dumbstruck , `` After all I 've taught you ? You know why it does n't work that way . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , right , because each time forges a nigh unbreakable bond that only you control , and your mind and that control diminishes proportionally to the number of people . '' <newline> <newline> Paraida finished tying her ponytail , and stared at the man she 'd only shared a bed with the night prior . Why was he suddenly bitter about matters they 'd buried years ago ? <newline> <newline> `` Do we have a problem , my love ? '' She blanched as he flinched at her words . `` If there is any weakness or issue between us , they will eat us alive . They are true murderers . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' Coumanda replied , `` I am more than ready to punish them . We are killers too . '' <newline> <newline> `` Only at need , Coumanda , as now . Prepare yourself , I do n't want to risk losing you to them again . '' Coumanda 's pacing had surreptitiously placed him just to her left . He now drew his sword . <newline> <newline> `` You should n't rely on that , '' Paraida said when she heard the scrape of steel , `` our power will serve much more than -- Ugh ! '' She was momentarily delirious as the blade erupted from her gut . In that moment , she knew her mistake , but it was far too late . <newline> <newline> `` It was n't enough that you forced your sickening power upon me ! '' Coumanda screamed into her ear , `` You had to break my resolve , and make me love you ! I swore you would die for your crimes , did you think I gave up on that ? '' Across the way , the two men froze and stared , bewildered that their enemies had turned on one another . They elected to watch it play out . <newline> <newline> `` I can feel your energies leaving me , Paraida ! All that remains are the powers I cultivated under your tutelage . I believe it will be sufficient . Do n't worry , I fully intend to carry this fight to its conclusion . Watch carefully as I dispatch your hated nemeses , 'my love ' . Try not to die before I do . '' With that , he wrenched his blade from her back , not bothering to wipe it as he strode toward the now smiling duo . <newline> <newline> `` Coumanda ! '' Boomed Hauvark , `` I would never have expected this from you , little man ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I take it you have abandoned your pursuit of us ? '' The other , Dwendell said , `` I think you 've earned yourself a stay of execution . That woman has harried our steps forever ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , no , friends . I mean to send you to join her . I just wanted her to see that I did n't need her to make that happen ! ''

2,"*Click . * <newline> <newline> My chest blossoms red , and it 's as if I 'm being gently pushed backward . The searing pain comes shortly after , and each breath just may be my last one . I can feel the bullet piercing my rib cage , wreaking havoc upon my internal organs . With each second I near closer to the point of no return . <newline> <newline> *Click . * <newline> <newline> I slump backward , my head hitting the cold floor with a sickening thud . The lights are a bright , harsh white , but they seem to be getting dimmer . I fear closing my eyes , because they may never open again . Darkness is encroaching upon the edges of my vision . <newline> <newline> *Click . * <newline> <newline> My breathing is shallower now . I 'm breathing harder than I 've ever had to before , but it 's not enough . I know it 's never going to be enough , because I 'm quickly fading . <newline> <newline> *Click . * <newline> <newline> I can feel my heartrate increasing as it tries to keep blood coursing throughout my body , but it 's only getting weaker . I 've given up . I accept that I 'm dying , and there 's nothing that I can do to change that . <newline> <newline> *Click . * <newline> <newline> My breath is a slow rattle and my vision fades to black . Despite my heart 's best efforts , blood has stopped reaching my brain . The cold concrete around me is stained red with my blood , and at this point it does n't even frighten me . It 's hard to believe that at one point my body held so much blood , yet now it holds so little . The last thing I feel is the rough concrete floor tearing into my skin , a final embrace from the only place I 've ever known . <newline> <newline> *Bang ! * <newline> <newline> If only death could really be so easy . The revolver reaches its final cylinder , and this time a bullet is propelled straight into my chest , accompanied with the crack of a gunshot . I 'm pushed backwards by the impact of the bullet , forcefully slumped against the wall . It 's a game of Russian Roulette , but I 'm the only one that will ever experience the pain . He enjoys that , seeing my fear , never knowing when it 'll be an actual bullet . I 've learned to suppress my fear , but I do n't . If they knew I was n't actually scared of what they might do to me , they might try something worse . Something I might actually fear . <newline> <newline> I crumple to the ground , clutching the entry wound . I writhe in agony , hoping that every minute will be my last with him . He fractures in maniacal laughter , relishing every bit of my pain . He 's been the most difficult interrogator so far . This one in particular has delighted in my suffering the most . <newline> <newline> He reloads and shoots me again while I 'm down , cackling gleefully at the symphony of my screams . I scream louder than I have to , hoping it will satisfy him like it has satisfied the rest , but it never does . <newline> <newline> This bullet has entered my back , piercing my lungs . It 's as if I 'm breathing fire in with every breath . I 'm in the fetal position to prevent him from reaching the first wound . He might not be satisfied , and I want to stop him from aggravating the hole in my chest . I wish I could kill them all , to have them feel the constant suffering that is my current condition , but I must contain myself . I have to believe things will get better , or I will lose my sanity . <newline> <newline> I refuse to allow my will to break . I will not allow myself to submit to the welcoming sway of insanity . Despite my best efforts , I am unable to die . <newline>

2,"Throughout the history of human literature , stories , and fiction , there have been tales of people able to use a force beyond comprehension : magic . For hundreds of years , humans believed magic to impossible and for them , they were right . Humans can ’ t use magic or sorcery , charms or hexes , witchcraft or wizardry . It was never a lack of faith , intelligence , or ability on their part . It was their evolution . <newline> <newline> <newline> Across the galaxy , there exist thousands of worlds inhabited by creatures who bend the very laws of physics as humans know them . Entire civilizations built upon the use of arcane . From the Eltrian cities sung into existence from the forests to the great Dwirthite halls beneath their planet ’ s surface to the breath-taking reefs of the Aqueiods hidden beneath the waves , there are thousands of peoples who use magic as their science , their way of life . They are connect through the great network of portals constructed by the gods of old . <newline> <newline> <newline> Humanity is the only known species incapable of using magic . It was forced to carve its own path through the great vastness of space . Chemistry dissolved alchemy . Electricity fried mana . Aerodynamics rose above levitation . Robotics defeated golemmancy . Medicine cured the apothecary . Physics wretched control from the universe itself . Hard logic cut soft emotion . The scientist usurped the mage . <newline> <newline> <newline> Humanity was forced to develop science for a reason it had never expect : Humans bleed red . <newline> <newline> <newline> Human blood flow with a crimson hue due to the presence of hemoglobin , specifically the iron contained within . While the magic dwellers had no understanding of why iron was able to stymie their flow of mana , the humans could see it plain as day once magic was brought under the light of science . Magic works by influencing the Hex field , a near omnipresent force similar to the Higgs field . However , the Hex field is influenced not by particles on the microscopic scale like the Higgs nor on the macroscopic scale like gravity , but rather by compositions , structures , and orientation . <newline> <newline> <newline> Because of how this field behaves , the presence different elements and compounds can causes spells to behave differently . Gold , silver , and bronze all appear to magnify a spell strength by varying degrees . Wands made of wood from certain species of trees act like radio antennae . Glyphs and runes change a spell through their shape alone . <newline> <newline> <newline> For the Hex field , iron is unique . Whereas other materials amplify magic , iron silences . It acts like a black hole for magic , pulling in everything and releasing nothing . To carry an exposed iron block in a city of magic would be to bring unshielded radioactive waste into the Terran council building . <newline> <newline> <newline> By evolving on a planet with a nickel-iron core , developing iron in its own blood , and crafting an empire from the accursed metal , humanity managed to become the antithesis to the rest of the universe . And when the beast of war finally reared its ugly head , Humanity donned its armor crafted of iron and drew its sword of harden steel . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> -- - <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> I posted this over on [ r/HFY ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/HFY/ ) a couple months back and have reposted here at least once after that in response to a relevant prompt . I 've been trying to write a [ series ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/red_blood ) on r/HFY centered around this concept but its been difficult coming up with a coherent story-line with enough detail . If you guys have any suggests , just say so .

2,"So , this is an idea I 've been kicking around for a series of short stories , hope that 's applicable . The idea is that every story is told from the perspective of a boss/mini-boss in an RPG , and every story ends with the 'heroes ' suffering gruesome deaths . This is the prologue , told by the 'Final Boss ' <newline> <newline> “ You die this day , demon ! ” Devils below , I hate this phrase . I hear it once every year or so , and every time I do my best to kill whatever moron says it in the most painful way possible . Usually I strip the offending party ’ s flesh from his or her bones , all while keeping their higher brain functions going . Whenever they have a protective spell around their body , though , I take special care in making them watch their friends die one by one , until they break down from realizing that their quest ends in failure , at which point they give up on life . Then , and only then , do I strip the flesh from their bones . I take the muscle , veins , arteries , capillaries , sinew , and other assorted body parts as well . I ’ ll not be called a slacker . <newline> <newline> Here ’ s what I hate about that insipid phrase : it makes several assumptions . First , as an immortal , I do not die . At worst I would be sealed away for a hundred years or so . Second , any battle I deign to fight is going to be in my own pocket dimension , which is a pit of eternal night and bleakness , so there is no ‘ day. ’ Third , I am not a demon . I am *far* superior to any lowly demon I would throw against foolish heroes . Of course , to any pitiful Paladin who stumbles in off the street , the difference would be difficult to notice . Since Paladins are scum of the Earth , and I say that as someone who regularly uses literal soap scum to murder infants , I would expect nothing less than sheer idiocy . To every other human on the planet , I ’ d hope you ’ d recognize the ETERNAL MASTER OF CHAOS , MALUM THE DIVINELY EVIL , hereafter referred to as simply ‘ Mal , ’ as being several places higher than a ‘ demon. ’ And finally , the gall of these pathetic mortals to assume that they have almost a fraction of the power necessary to defeat me is an insult . <newline> <newline> Since you have the brain capacity to read ( or , more accurately , the social status necessary to have such an education ) , you ’ re probably wondering what this has to do with you . Well , as I understand it , the humans and their associated humanoid races surrounding them have occasionally found the act of writing to ease their stress . I ’ ve found myself especially vexed as of late , as the greater ‘ holy hero ’ community has found my greatest weakness lately , and I ’ ve been in damage control since then . Now , as to why you in particular have found this… <newline> GRULO-VASH-IKAL-SUMAN . <newline> <newline> Assuming that my magic is still active , you should now be inclined to copy the contents of this volume of stories as best you can as many times as the spell deems necessary . The work of Mal must continue , from the high reaches of Skyton to the pathetic wretches of Oldport . But enough of all that . Here are a collection of stories to inspire fear into the hearts of any pathetic would-be heroes , may they all die many fathoms from my doors . <newline>

2,"I thought there were only three buses , but they just kept pouring into the parking lot . Soon , there were too many of us to be comfortable standing around . I kept asking if anyone knew why we were here , but no one else had a clue , either . The trees surrounding us seemed to be endless . On the trip , I had n't seen a building in hours . Until we arrived at our destination . The enormous building seemed to be all glass , but we could n't see inside . There was no indication whatsoever of what the place was . We were entirely clueless , just standing around . Waiting . <newline> <newline> Then , a pane of glass on the building opened like a door , and out stepped a slender woman in a power suit . She was young , but looked confident . Smug . In her right hand , she had a clip board , and in her left was a megaphone . She walked quickly to the center of the enormous crowd , then spoke into the megaphone . <newline> <newline> `` Welcome to Advantus . '' She took a long pause before continuing . `` You have been brought here today to help us do some research . As you can probably tell , you are a large variety of human beings . Old , young , dark , light , and anything and everything in between . '' <newline> <newline> She was then interrupted by someone in the crowd , man appearing to be in his late thirties-early forties , with thinning hair and wearing a bath robe . `` So you pulled me out of my house yesterday morning for some god damn research ? ! What the HELL is going on ? ! '' The crowd then became riled , everyone talking at once . But the woman remained entirely composed . <newline> <newline> `` We at Advantus understand your concerns and will do everything we can to solve your issue . '' <newline> <newline> I looked back over at the man , but I could n't find him . He had disappeared into the crowd . Another person piped up , a young girl carrying a backpack . She could n't have been more than 12 . <newline> <newline> `` I wan na go home ! Please , can I go home ? '' <newline> <newline> She had started to cry , but suddenly stopped when the woman replied `` Please remain calm . There is no reason for alarm . When our research is completed , you will all be returned to where you came from . '' <newline> <newline> I tried to make my way to the girl , to maybe offer some comfort , but she , too , had disappeared into the crowd . I had a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach . The woman again spoke . <newline> <newline> `` In a few moments , you will enter the Advantus facility . Simply comply with whatever is asked of you , and the research will be completed as quickly as possible . '' As soon as she had finished , the entire front of the building opened , like double doors . `` Please , enter the Advantus facility . '' <newline> <newline> Some tried to resist . But they disappeared as well . Those of us that entered without fuss were met with another woman , very similar to the first . They could have been sisters . She , too , spoke through a megaphone . <newline> <newline> `` Thank you . Your concerns have been noted . We will begin our research momentarily . '' <newline> <newline> Then everything went black .

2,"“ Shit ! ! ! ! ! Shit shit shit shit shit ” <newline> <newline> Roland was running and yelling as fast and loud as he could . Behind him were two men on horses clothed in fine roman armour . Roland cursed his jeans and hoodie that made him stand out in the flat fields just outside Rome . The girl had told him it was around 40 something BC and it certainly looked like it , but he didn ’ t . He didn ’ t know how he got here but here was going to kill him . <newline> <newline> The roman soldiers on horseback were gaining on him , smiling , thinking they were going to have some fun with an easy target in strange garments . <newline> <newline> “ Stop thief ! If you surrender maybe we ’ ll just lop off one of your hands , not both ” yelled one of them when he thought he was in earshot . Roland ’ s lead was steadily disappearing and he knew it . He took a sharp right into the tall grass that was high enough to mask his feet hoping he could lose them , but he was sadly mistaken . The army bred horses turned and followed him without slowing down . The closer soldier unsheathed his sword ready to slice an open back . <newline> <newline> Each of Rolands steps began to get slower than the rest , and which each step the hooves got louder and louder . The lead soldier with his sword out prepared to strike . This is it Roland thought as he took one more step . But there was no ground beneath him and his foot just continued to travel down into what he thought was nothingness . Why did this happen ? Why me ? Then it all went black . <newline> <newline> The lead soldier missed the thief ’ s back by an inch and he quickly circled around the once empty pit . The second solder pulled back the reins before his horse would follow the mysterious thief down . They paused on their horses looking down at the crumpled body . The pit was only a foot or so deep . Like the thief the pit was out of place in the field . <newline> <newline> “ Think he cracked his head ? ” asked the second soldier maintaining his position on his horse . <newline> “ Get off and check ” replied the first soldier . The second soldier dismounted his horse with a grunt and jumped into the hole . <newline> “ Somehow he ’ s still alive . He ’ s a weird one . Where do you think he got these strange clothes ” <newline> “ I don ’ t care . Lets settle him up . Maybe we can get some coin for him ” the first solider said with a disappointed grunt . He wanted the high from killing in a chase . “ No point wasting a body on sport if there ’ s no sport to be had ” . <newline> “ Slave or parts ? <newline> “ He looks like young boy , bet he hasn ’ t even suckled on a woman ’ s tit . Lets give him a chance ” <newline> “ Slave it is then ” . The second solider picked up the thief and tossed him out of the pit . “ Hopefully the Colosseum is nicer to him than these fields ” . <newline> “ No strange pits in the Colosseum , except the ones the tigers come out of ” chuckled the first solider . They put the thief onto the back of one of the horses and began riding towards Rome . <newline>

2,"A war sci-fi I 've been wanting to write fore ages : <newline> <newline> People don ’ t change , you know ? They might , say , pretend to be something they ’ re not but they only really are a mere shadow of their usual self . And the harder you try to become someone you are simply mentally not , the worse it gets . The stronger the thing you ’ re trying to get away from becomes . Because you ’ re set that way . And all the bad things you ’ re afraid you ’ ll do because of that small , annoying slither of bad in your soul will happen . Eventually , that is . Unless you die , of course . That ’ s why conscription is always a last ditch effort in war . Because not everyone is born to fight . Some are , some aren ’ t and some just don ’ t know yet . It ’ s usually fifty-fifty . Half can manage to willfully fight , somehow , and half can ’ t - but they will , staring down the barrel of the guy with the big gun telling them what to do . I think it was Lenin who said “ One man with a gun can control one hundred without one ” . Except they do have guns - but so does the guy trying to kill both them , their families and all that they hold dear . So , I guess , it ’ s human instinct to protect what you need to . Primal . And as fleeing doesn ’ t really apply here , the only rule out of “ fight or flight ” that can be used down here is fight . And fighting is all that there has been for the last forty three years on the surface . You see , it was also Lenin who said “ A lie told often enough becomes the truth ” , and that ’ s what happened to the Second Great Soviet Alliance . <newline> <newline> November 15th , 2046 - The First Contact War ends after nearly eight years . 320 million killed and the SGSA is formed in mainland Europe , excluding the Netherlands , Russia , the Middle East , large areas of Southeast Asia and parts of South America . <newline> <newline> May 12th , 2048 - The Earth Republic is formed after tensions with the SGSA due to a huge military buildup . This consists of Britain ( left as the largest individual power after the First Contact War ) and its commonwealth subsidiaries , USA , China , the United African Council , South Africa , Japan and the United Korea as its main powers . The ER and SGSA fall into the Second Cold War . <newline> <newline> 2059 - Long distance faster-than-light travel has now become capable within the ER , Britain rolls off its first military starship , the HMS Victory II , as does the US with the USS Constitution . This prompts the SGSA , who had no starship capability at this time , to reply with revealing their industrial cloning program , allowing them a much larger and expendable military . <newline> <newline> 2061 - ER propaganda dropped into now deeply impoverished SGSA countries results in a mass migration from the SGSA into the ER , leaving little to no civilians in the SGSA . Clone soldiers begin to waver , causing the SGSA ’ s central government , based in Paris , France , to issue Initiative de la Pensée or IDLP , translating to “ The One Thought Initiative ” , essentially brainwashing for the clones . <newline> <newline> 2072 - SGSA ’ s force of now nearly 2.3 billion clones and 700 million regular soldiers has run into a food crisis . Clones are being produced at such a rate that they can ’ t be fed . Refusing help , the SGSA is becoming more aggressive . <newline> <newline> August 14th , 2074 - After several border skirmishes all the powers in the ER unite their forces into the ERDF , Earth Republic Defence Force , led by Britain and the US . The ERDF offers better technology and training over the SGSA ’ s armed forces , who have vastly larger numbers and a higher production rate . <newline> <newline> September 11th , 2074 - In a pre-emptive nuclear strike , the SGSA attacks the ER in it ’ s desperation . The cities that have not had the circulation of ERDF weaponry and forces can not bat back the warheads with Anti-ICBM systems , and tens of cities are destroyed with hundreds of millions of lives alongside them . The ER fights back with a larger nuclear assault . Destroying nearly every city in the SGSA . This assault kills almost all of the SGSA ’ s surviving civilian population , but the SGSA reveals that there was no damage to their secret underground facilities that run the military . <newline> <newline> September 12th , 2074 - A huge ER offensive begins , liberating most of Europe and penetrating deep into Russia and the Middle East , annexing all SGSA governing in South America . <newline> <newline> September 29th , 2074 - ER advance grinds to a halt as SGSA production catches up . War of attrition begins . Quality vs quantity . <newline> <newline> October 16th , 2074 - China falls , evacuation of Austrilasian and Southeast Asian ER populations begins . <newline> <newline> October 20th , 2074 - South East Asia and Australasia falls to the SGSA . War is now focussed in Western Russia . <newline> <newline> June 3rd , 2117 - The beginning of the end . <newline>

I give the bar man a blank stare and he eventually tells me Tuesday . Tuesday-the-what I ask . I get directed to a `` Things to put off '' calendar secured above photos at the end of the bar . <newline> <newline> I order a pint . He asks a pint of what , I tell him beer . <newline> <newline> Time travel is hard to explain to the layman . I mean they have the terminology down from books or movies . Most people even have the basic understanding of paradoxes . But it is the difference between ... well say maths with finite sets compared to infinite sets . Or if that 's still a bit nerdy it 's the difference between porn and sex , or a fight scene in the latest cinema and a drunken argument gone physical at the local public house . Oh ! Or if you 're doctor watching ER , or an engineer watching any movie where a building blows up . <newline> <newline> Or perhaps its better to say its like sewer work . There 's a lot that needs to be done , the infrastructure is crumbling , it 's not glorious but needed and occasionally when you lose your balance you 're covered in shit and angry at the world . Not to mention that almost everyone else goes on with their their lives never knowing about your job unless you screw up . <newline> <newline> That was my day . Granted it spanned some five hundred years in seven authorized slips and four off-the-book slips , but shit is shit and when your shoveling it you do n't really take notice of the flowers or sunsets . <newline> <newline> I order another ... pint ? hoping to get three or four down before I have to suss out the local currency . <newline> <newline> **Tried to write it using British terms .

2,"Prologue <newline> <newline> `` 3 , 2 , 1 , Drop ! '' <newline> <newline> *There is no feeling quite like the moment your pod hits the atmosphere . Even though descent takes several minutes , usually it feels like only a few seconds have passed when the pod slams into the ground . * <newline> <newline> `` Grab your rifle , look for cover . '' - The words of his instructor went through his head again . <newline> One last quick look over the screens . <newline> `` Wait , the Friend-or-Foe system is disabled . '' <newline> -Click- <newline> Suddenly , all the dots on the vicinity-scanner turned red . He landed behind enemy lines . The mission was to work his way into an enemy command building so maybe he just got even closer . There was only one lifesign right by him and it was right in front of the pod . He released the hatch , blowing half a ton of metal into the enemy 's face . After a quick look around he found himself on the roof of the building he was supposed to infiltrate . <newline> <newline> `` So far so good . '' <newline> <newline> He grabbed the rest of his gear and ran for what seemed to be a door to the stairs . While silently working his way down the stairs he realized that it seemed like no one noticed his landing . After enabling the silencer module on his X21 assault rifle he checked his map . The commander he was supposed to take out was only one floor below and luckily the building was guarded almost only on the ground level . At the bottom of the next flight of stairs were two guards , but 2 quick headshots took care of them . Now all that was between him and the commander was the door infront of him . He kicked down the door and took a step into the room , only to stare down the barrel of a pistol in the commander 's hand who quickly pulled the trigger . <newline>

2,"To the planet bellow , it just looked like a new star in the sky . Which was not as big a deal for all but a select few who had been tracking the movements of the cosmos . But in actuality , this was a space station , privately owned , and unaffiliated with any particular country or organization . <newline> <newline> It hung there in much the same spot for about a week , and life below carried on as normal . People worked , socialized , and acted as if it was any other sort of day . there was absolutely nothing to suggest anything different . <newline> <newline> But on board the space station things were different . The final preparations were completed , all systems were ready to go and it just took the order from the high commander . <newline> <newline> Realizing the importance of this event he paused briefly , gave a speech declaring just how momentous an occasion it was , and then gave the order . As soon as he did the commands were executed in the space stations main computer . Parts of the space station opened up and a high frequency signal transmitted laterally , spreading to all the other satellites in orbit of the planet . <newline> <newline> The high commander smirked , and gave the command that changed the world . `` Fire . '' <newline> <newline> Each of the hijacked satellites began to realign themselves , in compliance with the illicit order . Two beams shot forth from the space station , it arced from that to every satellite in sequence surrounding the planet . Numbers on the space stations computers climbed to optimal levels . <newline> <newline> The satellites aimed the beam at the planet . Almost instantly two things happened simultaneously , first everything with any kind of electrical circuit fried and stopped working , and secondly everyone 's mind was erased of any knowledge they had pertaining to making electrical components . <newline> <newline> In one act , the world turned to chaos . The high commander smiled , as his space station disappeared from orbit .

3,"After 3 hours of driving around to local gas station 's bathrooms looking for condoms , Alex pulled up to Lily 's apartment . They had been talking about having sex for weeks but wanted to be safe about their first time together . Alex , unsuccessful in his quest , exited the car and approached the building 's main entrance , palms sweaty , breath minty . Lily buzzed him in and he walked to her front door , which opened before he could knock . <newline> <newline> Lily pushed through the door and jumped into Alex 's arms , kissing his face and squealing gleefully . Lily closed the door behind her , mumbling `` goodbye '' to her roommates as the door shut . The pair walked down the hall and Lily asked the question Alex was dreading . `` You found some right , because we made an agreement that we needed one . '' <newline> <newline> Alex glanced at Lily and shook his head , his face a frown . Their trip was silent until they arrived at their usual spot . `` So ... Do you just wan na make out then , '' Alex probed . Lily turned and slapped him hard on the cheek . `` No , I want to do something else tonight . '' She looked mischievous as she said it . Alex grinned , `` And what is that ? '' Air thick with sexual tension . `` I want to have . '' Then a pause . She continued . `` Tacos . ''

3,"She sat crumpled on her threadbare couch , guzzling a cheap bottle of wine and questioning her ability to do this . She had always known raising a kid would n't be easy , but it was so much harder than she 'd thought .

He 'd wailed when she said Bud was n't coming to Dad 's Day at school . He accused her of making Daddy stay away because she was mean . Oh , how his tiny fists and words flayed her heart open . She remained calm until he called her by her name . Like she was some stranger he 'd met , not Mommy . All her hurt came lashing out at him . `` Daddy would rather be doing your teacher !

His right hand held the talisman , the only weapon that could forever vanquish the evil that came from beyond . <newline> <newline> 'Well , Eric my boy ' , he whispered to himself , twirling the glowing disc between his fingers , 'This is it . This is the price you pay for being the most powerful darn sorcerer in New York City . You get to be the saviour of a million ignorant shits oblivious to the fact that ... ' <newline> <newline> Suddenly the talisman flashed a brilliant green , and the light winked out , grim darkness returning . The walls in the room began to creak and groan as the darkness thickened . So , Eric thought , looks like the bastards are starting a little early today . <newline> <newline> The demons came through the walls ; twisted , glabrous , hungry for wizard 's blood . Eric sat motionless until they crawled within inches of his face . Thick snot dribbled down their eyeless faces , scorching his clothes . Eric knew however that he still had to wait . He needed the perfect moment to strike them . The Draconian Binding would work only once . <newline> <newline> One of the demons sniffed him . A slimy tongue slowly emerged . <newline> <newline> The time was now . <newline> <newline> 'ABRAXOS ! ' Eric yelled . <newline> <newline> Nothing happened . <newline> <newline> Shit .

3,"I could make out soft distant whispers that sounded like familiar voices - who were they and what were they saying ? Someone said stay strong , another said it 'll be alright , I hear a few whimpers , there was definitely someone crying . I tried to move my arms but it felt like I forgot how to , same for my legs . My eyelids felt like they had weighed a ton , I knew I should have gotten more sleep . <newline> <newline> I force them open and I see nothing but bright light shining right back at me . Damn , I must have forgot to pull the blinds again , probably dead beat last night . I try to recall last night but nothing comes to me - wild night perhaps ? <newline> <newline> A few dark figures start towering over me , I ca n't make them out . Stay away , I know how to fight and can take you down . Still , no movement from my limbs , maybe I ca n't take them . `` Honey , I think he 's finally awake '' I knew that voice . Her words gave warmth , much like a long hug . Only my mother could do that , only her . <newline> <newline> I suddenly felt weak , the light disappearing . I hear monitors beeping , people shouting . I remember a car 's headlights . My eyes could n't open . I 'm not ready . <newline> <newline> Please help ! <newline> <newline> Help ...

3,"As an impending sunset streaked the sky in bright crimson , John watched the leader of his nation address the crowd . The masses marveled at his diction , at his passion , at his dedication to strengthening the newly-forged , fragile peace . Hope filled the air as water fills a glass , nods and affirmations responded to the speaker 's wise words . For the first time in this uneasy truce , the two nations seemed closer , sharing a common purpose . Thousands had gathered at the square to hear this speech but , John marvels , all were silent . Everything will be different now , their leader assured them , there was nothing to fear anymore . <newline> <newline> John thought of the recent attacks and could never have predicted this amazing outcome . New opportunities , a bright new future for his children ; that 's when it happened . <newline> <newline> Shots rang out throughout the square and fear quickly pervaded the crowd . Screams echoed - few at first , then many - a cacophony of despair . A panicked stampede moving nowhere rendered John incapable of escape . <newline> <newline> In the wake of it all , there it was . <newline> The body of the one man keeping peace .

3,"The children 's cheerful shrieks echoed throughout the playground of the school , and their resounding cries filled the ears of many . Although the sound was quite annoying , it showed that the children were happy , and that was all that mattered . If one were to enter the playground , that person would be swarmed by smiles , warmth , and sticky fingers . Their eyes would be lit up , pleased that they had someone else to share their joy with . <newline> <newline> However , if one were to examine the situation closer , their joy is darker than first perceived . The youngsters ' childhood innocence was poisoned by the beliefs of their pale moms and dads . <newline> <newline> If someone actually looked , they would see a singular girl away from the others . Her head would be down , with torn up cornrows matching her dark face . If one approaches her , they would see her ripped and faded clothes . The girl 's scratched up knees and elbows would become more distinct . <newline> <newline> If someone were to rest next to her , she 'd flinch . Tenser with every moment , she would be terrified frozen . <newline> <newline> Her black eyes would display a great fear . But they 'd also hide a deeper loneliness . <newline> <newline> And that person would embrace her . She 'd know she was loved . <newline> <newline> But no one cares . <newline> <newline> Her skin 's wrong <newline> <newline> Not white . <newline> <newline> Black .

When she and the kids left after all the abuse I had thrown at them , I lost it . <newline> <newline> I tied a noose , knowing full well that I could never use it on my own neck . I was ultimately too scared , too worried about the consequences of my incredibly selfish , ignorant actions . Or , perhaps , I was scared of an afterlife that hated me and my beast within . <newline> <newline> I was walking in the park , at night , when I saw her walk by . She was a blonde , tall , light-skinned , and just plain solid gold to me . I wanted , instantly , to hold her , to ravage her , to protect her . <newline> <newline> She had a baby in her arms , the father seemingly gone . I had asked her where he was in her life . `` Gone , '' she said , a whimper in her saddened tone . She told me of his fight with cancer . <newline> <newline> I looked like him , I was told .

3,"I still do n't know to this day whether we were more confused over the other , or god 's sudden , fatal disappearance . <newline> <newline> Usually we 'd skip church and get stoned in the gutter between the parking lot and the stretch of weeds . We 'd drink whatever he could sneak from the cupboards of whoever it was he was staying with that week . More often than not it was spiked lemonade , or some other canned fruity things the mothers downed . <newline> <newline> I remember one day in specific when everything bad that could happen , had happened to him . You could n't tell he was crying , or why , but I knew him better than anyone . I knew there was a bad , burning taste of god in his mouth , then . I knew he was young ; I knew he was crushed by the weight . <newline> <newline> So we 'd go in for praise , then sneak out to worship each other . And we 'd cry , and we 'd drink , and we 'd smoke stale cigarettes . <newline> <newline> Soon , we started to skip the praise and service altogether . After all , they do say we are the church . Though I think we were the emptiest kind . We carried the weight of eachother 's cross . And nailed eachother on the floor . <newline> <newline> Maybe god was really watching . Maybe god was dead . Maybe he forgot . Maybe sleeping . <newline> <newline> Maybe .

3,"Father told me of a place where words do n't matter , where our identities are determined by the actions we take . I do not believe ; I am a skeptic in all things , romantic and logical , impossible to impress meaning upon . He says it is my function , that my meaning is itself to hold knowledge and emotion each apart . Partiality , he argued and continues to argue , will end his race faster than any disease ever could . <newline> <newline> I am young , so I do not understand what he means by partiality , what he warns . All I am is dispassionate , my self is a pure archive of logic , of arithmetic . I 'm bothered by his smiling , as I am by the fallacies he argues for . Of course partiality is worthwhile ; I am alone in my perfect understanding , meaningless . He is , as well , but his ignorance allows him grace I envy . <newline> <newline> `` Carrie , honey , we need your wisdom these days more than ever . They 're to destroy Earth in the name of fascism . You are pure , unbiased by emotion , unafraid of consequence . We have to save ourselves without our selves .

That 's all he had to say to me once I finally opened up to him about my problems ? Nearly falling on my face , I finally get the door to the roof to swing wide open . Curse that lying bastard for not caring about my obvious , slow decent into madness and sorrow . <newline> <newline> `` Quit being sensitive , and complaining about how your going though 'dark ' times and move on '' Stepping up to the ledge , his voice echoed in my head , still berating me . You could see the people , looking up , wondering were the flask came from . `` Oh no , '' someone gasped , once they understood the sight presented before them . Soaking in the glorious view from the top , gave me pause . 'You are just another coward , ' rang loudly in my head . All it took was one simple , determined step forward . <newline> <newline> It was quite easier than one would think . <newline> Nobody thought that I would actually do it . <newline> People watch me though the windows . <newline> The trip is n't too long . <newline> I close my eyes . <newline> Here it comes . <newline> Sweet release . <newline> `` Welcome .

3,"10 years ago , to the day , I slide a dove chocolate wrapper under your bedroom door , a note inside it . The note , written in chicken scratch on a piece of paper , asked a question , `` Will you be my girlfriend ? '' We both knew it was coming , I had just talked with your parents and asked if they had objections to us dating , they did n't . You opened it , your door still closed , and I heard a giggle escape you as you read . <newline> <newline> An eternity passed and I heard a mumble from beyond the door , I did n't understand it . `` What did you say , '' I asked , my hand reaching for the door knob and turning . The door opened and you were standing there with the chocolate and note . You smiled at me and repeated what I 'd missed , `` Yes , I 'd love to . '' <newline> <newline> Today , we 're married and staring in the face of an impossible decision . What we 've built these last 10 years is crumbling around us . We paid a professional to help us analyze our options . You still need time though , so now we separate . Maybe one day we can be together again . For now we both need some space . I 'm not hopeful this will change . We 're both so different now . And want different things . Soon we 'll be . A couple . Divorced .

3,"I remember vividly the day that I bought my first new car ; it was a cold rainy night in November . I had made a rather extravagant purchase that day , and I was unsure how I would pay for it . It seemed so much more straightforward at the dealership : nineteen hundred dollars a month for just sixty months . <newline> <newline> This shiny baby would catch eyes and win the respect of my coworkers , this car meant something . <newline> <newline> I had wanted a Porsche 911 convertible since I was fifteen ; something about those elegant curves . <newline> <newline> I supposed that I was going to get a lot of ladies driving a fast car . Of course , I would n't have a lot of money to spend on the ladies . I had car payments to make and an apartment for which to pay . Perhaps I could treat a woman to a ramen date or something . I sure liked ramen myself , I acquired that taste in college . <newline> <newline> I felt my car hit something that I did n't see . <newline> <newline> Some stupid motherfucker must have left a tire behind . <newline> <newline> I leapt out of my new vehicle , furious . <newline> <newline> How the fuck would I score now ? <newline> <newline> My car was fucked up pretty bad . <newline> <newline> I noted what I hit . <newline> <newline> What had I done ? <newline> <newline> I felt sick . <newline> <newline> I wept . <newline> <newline> Dead . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

I remember the expanse of black skies , imagining cosmonauts and aliens above us , bringing happy tidings from other worlds . Grazed knees and playing until last light with Jane , errant but wondrous goalkeeper , a smile across the fence . We quested throughout our neighbourhood , which was our world , keeping pets safe and judging old grumpy men . The days lengthened like our minds , her hair smelled like candy floss , and I was happy . <newline> <newline> Summer was the flowering of beauty and politics , new horizons , graduation , college , life exploding life . I was strong like Taurus , I hated the atom bomb , the cosmonauts became real . And Jane , naked Jane under the stars , whose body became my guiding constellation . We moved to the big city together , graduates , coffee lovers , worker bees . We married back in that field of our Spring , our stars . We had a baby -- late nights , white hairs , sudden emptiness . <newline> <newline> Autumn brought its thunder , Jane ’ s headaches , my dark moods . I found my temper , and Jane her sadness . The baby grew , she spoke , she smiled . I missed promotion , Jane missed family . Baby grew and moved away . <newline> <newline> Winter chilled our love . Our field withered . Darling Jane . Sorry .

3,"I told her that I ’ d painted her a sky the way she always wanted to see it , blues and pinks . Like a sunset , I said , but I didn ’ t really mean it , I meant like how I remembered our mornings . With the sun blushing her skin as soon as I opened the curtains to let in the day . She said she loved it and I ’ ve been trying to take compliments more readily so she ’ d smile . <newline> <newline> <newline> And she smiled and she kissed me and the day looked less like clouds and hail . She could do that , turn the rain clouds and hail into delicate threads of sunshine . Which I ’ d roll into balls of yarn in the colours rainbows seemed to bleed . It was an operation that required me to close my eyes and smile . <newline> <newline> <newline> My fingers knew the work well though , short practice with intense concentration . Tongue dragging the corners of mouth where I ’ d always thought best . Fingers combing through to pick only the best threads , absentminded .

3,"I never thought I 'd have to live through anything like that in my life , watching someone you hold dear die . <newline> It was really hard to avoid tearing up whenever I ended up thinking about what I 'd really done again . <newline> So I held the little box in my hands , everybody got one , but people rarely ever used them .

What are you grateful to have not experienced yet , but know that one day you will experience it sometime ? What can happen anytime , anywhere , and you can decide if it happens , but in many cases , you ca n't ? What is an endless nothingness , but perhaps a paradise depending on what you are religiously faithful to ? What is one of the most desired sensations for one , but also extremely terrifying for some ? What is extremely tolerant of anybody , and does n't care what you do or have done ? What is not neutral , kind , or evil , but is described as all of these ? What is one of the earliest fears of humanity , but also predates us ? What is a concept that is personified in multiple instances in literature ? <newline> <newline> If you truly want to know , I will tell you about it . Do n't say I did n't warn you of the horrors ahead . It is inevitable after all , this impending primal doom . You may try to stop it , but can you ?

In all likelihood , they probably did n't even know my name ; no way would they actually miss me . <newline> <newline> I jumped in my car and raced the other vehicles down the freeway , nearly hitting some . When I screeched to a stop in the driveway , I leaped out the driver-side door . Into the door I burst , calling out `` Honey ! Pack the bags ! It 's Fiji time !

3,"Potatoes have been one of the main staples for the Irish in what can be described as , `` a bit much . '' How can any ethnic and national population be so greatly taken by something as simple as the common potato ? For an increasingly inquisitive Irishman like Higgins , this mystery weighed heavily upon his often inebriated , and bald , head . Higgins was not the average Irishman , because he held a disdain for anything related to his culture . In a defiant act of protest , Higgins was determined to rid the village of all potatoes . <newline> <newline> As the farmers market set up one Saturday morning , Higgins took desperate and immediate action . There , in the centre of the market , sat six fat carts filled with potatoes . In the blink of an eye , Higgins slammed his car into a cart . He then began spinning , turning the hardy potatoes to instant mashed potatoes . The shattered cart was sent flying into the other potato carts . Higgins sat in his car , considering what he had done . The market had quickly emptied of the panicked vendors . But Higgins realized , with great horror , his failure . There it was , intact on his dashboard . It mockingly stared into his soul . The one thing he hated . Caught in constant pursuit . There it was . Right there . Potato . <newline>

3,"I was told that I had to write a story with 20 words , but I did n't know what to write . So I thought it would be really interesting to write a meta story about this strange writing prompt request . I think this writing prompt request is pretty silly because people can add arbitrary adjectives wherever they want . For example : `` I love this big , huge , tasty cookie '' is an easy way to get 7 words . You could make this a math problem and write some algorithm to generate 20 valid sentences . In such an algorithm , the nth sentence would have N minus n plus 1 words . In this case , we would just set the value of N to be 20 . Next , we will need a function to generate sentences with arbitrary word length . This is not trivial , because the sentences should have continuity between them . For example , we ca n't talk about airplanes , then switch to zebras . If we 're stuck , we can insert random adjectives before nouns . This can be done wrong if we use antonyms ! For example : `` It 's a big , small , round chair '' . In this case , the statement contradicts itself . I 'm having trouble writing this function . It is a difficult algorithm . I ca n't do it . I 'm too dumb . I 'm stupid . *Suicides* .

He had followed the maps and aside from having to avoid the storm he 'd been right on course . <newline> <newline> As he shivered from the cold and the building shock , he looked around to get his bearings .

He shook his head , a hallucination to be sure , just his storm-riddled mind panicking . <newline> <newline> Nervously he checked his pockets , hoping to find his glass , his fingers fumbling . 12 As he searched his pockets , his anger slowly rose up from within . He had trusted his map , he had trusted his ship mates . Now he was a captain without a ship , worse , shipwrecked . He felt a round object , could it possibly be ? Slowly he pulled out his last failing hope . He threw the broken stopwatch , `` Good Riddance ! '' From behind something huge hit him . It went for his watch . He reached for it . The crocodile bit . James screamed . *Tick* .

The man got out of his bed and slowly walked towards the window to see what the noise was . He slowly parted the curtains and looked out at his dark farm , nothing not a single thing was- . There , right at the back of his patio was a tall , naked , boney man who moved closer . Darren fell back , , closing the curtains and shuffled into the corner of his room completely baffled . He saw a thin shadow appear from behind his curtains , outside of his bedroom window . Darren scrambled to his feet and cautiously approached his window , he parted the curtains ... Nothing was to be seen , the man had left and Darren felt extremely stupid . He got back into bed , thinking what he saw was a hallucination . He laid back , closed his eyes once more and drifted away . Until he felt a cold chill roll down his spine . Then his eyes suddenly opened , he started to panic . Never had he though that this would happen . His bed slightly vibrated as the noise . Oh the noise , he feared it . From his bed , he heard ... Tap , tap , tap , tap . Tap , tap , tap . Tap , tap ...

4,"Ok so I know this is n't following the rules exactly , but the first paragraph of this is n't enough to get the feel for the story . Sorry to make you read more . <newline> <newline> When iron ore is removed from the ground it ’ s actually made of iron oxide , that is , to say , an iron and oxygen molecule . Then , the raw ore is moved to a blast furnace where the oxygen is removed , forcefully and violently with inundating amounts of heat . The oxygen , effectively , burns off , leaving behind raw iron . Raw iron , however , doesn ’ t last very long on its own if you use it for building and pipes and such . So the raw iron gets sent to a bessemer , where it ’ s alloyed with other metals that make it stronger and last unnaturally long in the form into which it will be later set . Lastly , the iron alloy is then sent to a mill where it ’ s formed into various materials needed for construction . Pipes , beams , bars , sheets . Whatever you need to build , they form this iron alloy into that shape , and mankind has since called it ‘ steel ’ . <newline> <newline> All this energy , the heat , the other metals , the forming of the steel into constructs , is being stored into the alloy . Not too dissimilar to the way alkaline batteries are charged . So when the construction workers lay down the steel pipes into the ground , they ’ re really putting a whole lot of energy into the soil , which is often a wet , slightly acidic solution . By putting these two materials next to each other , a potential is created . A potential of energy . Think of it like a water tank being put next to a deep , empty hole in the ground and then poking a small hole in the bottom of the tank . And what happens when the hole is put into the tank ? The water will flow . And in that same manner , current flows from the steel in the ground into the soil . <newline> <newline> What most people don ’ t realize is that the flow of current is the complete opposite of the flow of electrons . It has to do with a positive/negative denoting by Benjamin Franklin when he started experimenting with electricity . But when I say current flows from the pipe into the soil , I really mean electrons flow from the soil onto the pipe . <newline> <newline> Your first thought might be : “ So what ? Is it a lot of current ? ” . Well no , it ’ s not that much . You ’ d never feel it if you touched the two materials . But over time , this current flow , which is as natural as water flowing downstream , will breakdown the steel . It will corrode the iron alloy back into what it was originally made from ; iron oxide . That ’ s what rust is made out of . <newline> <newline> So despite all our efforts , our centuries of learning how to manipulate the iron ores we found in mountains , and our vast complex steel structures , our metal metropolises , will eventually return to their natural states from which they were found . <newline> <newline> When mankind is gone , or at least so scattered that they can no longer maintain their sand castles to the same degree to which they were designed , the metals will all crumble leaving behind the ores from which they originally came . Like we were never even there . All we have built will become one with the earth again , and , in the end , we will become part of the soil . <newline> <newline> And that is where this story begins . At the end . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> Silence filled the ship . We knew the station was erupting around us , but somehow those sounds were drowned out by the silence building inside the ship . Topher idly pressed some buttons onto the console while simultaneously buckling his body harness to the chair . Everything was so white . Light seemed to come from everywhere . <newline> <newline> `` Where are we going ? '' Theta asked hesitantly . <newline> <newline> `` The navigation computers did n't have enough data a specific planet yet , but there 's a nice looking galaxy not too far away . About 2.5 million light years , '' replied Topher with a relaxed voice , as if he were giving directions to the nearest drug store . `` Anywhere is better than here . '' <newline> <newline> `` I guess we 're starting a new story , '' I told Theta , trying to distract her from the stress . Stress is bad for the pregnancy . <newline> <newline> `` I guess so , '' she faked a smile for me . I 'll learn how to help her better in the future . <newline> <newline> The silence grew deeper . The walls thrummed as I felt a pull inside my chest . Everything went white . And we were gone .

4,"The final stop of the field trip was the most widely anticipated . The children poured out of the bus onto the sidewalk that wrapped around the structure . I had them line up outside and called out their names one by one to make sure everyone was accounted for . It was a relatively small group , but I wanted to build anticipation for the great unveiling . <newline> <newline> … <newline> <newline> Lucy in particular had been enthralled by the story . She was sitting upon the lap of the great monument . Wonder painted her expression as she leaned in to plant the most innocent kiss on the ring of the resting hand . Then she looked up at him and her small voice rang out . “ Thank you , Godfather . ”

4,"One does n't really understand the capabilities of a large group of people , until they witness the weight and intentions of a mob first hand . The pipe I had lodged in the door handles was solid , not hollow , yet it squealed as it was warped and bent by the waning door handles . The noises were the worst part , there was nowhere to go , I just had to wait and see what would happen when those doors gave in . It was n't like breathing , more like the last noises of dying vermin before they perish , whistling through their rotting throats like a chorale of vultures . There was a haunting cadence to their effort , it was automatic , robotic even . They could n't see , or hear much , but I knew they could smell me . I knew that they wanted to rip my flesh apart like barbecue , though they felt no hunger , just a need to eviscerate . <newline> <newline> <newline> It almost more of just an itch now . The kind that you get as the last bit of scab falls off of a cut and it goes back to smooth flesh . I had a nice long draw on my water bottle , appreciating the supreme difference between rainwater and well water . I checked my pocket watch , gave it another wind , and headed out to do my rounds . The smell of death was finally leaving our meat that was hanging from the hooks outside . It was almost fully cured . It had lost the water that had all of the meat swollen . I could finally pull the wedding rings and watches off of the hands .

4,"I was riding in the train towards the facility and my heart was pounding . I could n't believe it - working for this company was all I ever wanted . Sure , all my peers and professors at Harvard thought I was insane to want to join this group in particular - 'A bunch of mad scientists ' my physics teacher would always say . But they paid an incredible amount compared to what what anyone else in my field paid and that was n't counting health and social benefits - I 'd be able to pay my entire tuition costs in 6 months . Too bad this was only a job interview ... <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> My leg was shattered , my arm was badly cut up and , if I was n't mistaken , the damage to my throat would render me permanently unable to speak . Yet , as the robotic hand lifted the remains of the giant ant off of me , I felt far more invigorated than even when my acceptance letters from all the Ivy League colleges arrived during the Summer after I graduated High School . `` Are you okay ? '' he asked me as he tried to help me up . `` You need to go to the hospital . '' He jumped with fright as I fired the voltage pistol behind him into the insect , causing it to burst into green blood and gore . Turning his head to mine , he gave what I think was a smile - which was impressive since all he had were robotic eyelids . `` So , still want the job ? '' <newline> <newline> Best . Day ! **EVER ! ! **

4,"Just do it ! '' I yelled . The sweltering heat of the room was only compounded by the fact that the barrel of my service pistol was pointed directly at my face . `` I trusted you man ! Seven years of this shit ! '' Juan was pissed and rightly so . I was deep undercover and the gig was up . `` Damn it . You 're a pig ! Damn it to hell ! '' His hand was shaking as he thumbed at the safety . `` I 'm gon na do it ! Man , I 'm fucking going to do it ! '' I raised my hands slowly while taking in a deep breath . `` Then do it .

'' I laughed , only ceasing when she shot a look of distain back in my direction . `` You 're up for promotion . I suggest you take it . Start a family and settle down . '' I groaned as I sat up in the chair . Glancing down at my bandaged hand , a reminder of the last two weeks of hell , I could n't help but shake my head . `` As long as I get a pay raise and an office with a window , you 've got a deal .

4,"The village ’ s harvest festival was fully underway , the sounds of children could be heard playing the carnival games , the smell of fried food engulfed the village inviting all in the valley to come join in their merriment , the invite however was also received by those who sought to sow the seeds of darkness throughout the lands . Warriors stood vigil at the entrance to the village at each gate , clad in their rusted armor they stood watching each visitor enter the village carefully inspecting each participant that passed them looking for signs that they had been corrupted . As the night began to dwindle and the light of the hearths dulled a darkness slowly swept over the village blotting out the ever increasing sunlight , the warriors drew their swords readying themselves for the battle that was to ensue . <newline> <newline> <newline> And so as the warriors stood at the precipice of change , their world was no longer their own and their feats consigned to legend . The rocks below fought back against the waves that crashed into them just as the warriors had over the course of the years , an always losing battle it was , but a battle they fought each and every day . They looked below then at each other before taking the plunge to the rocky shore below them , they would be the first ones to stem the tide of the spreading corruption and with their actions the light they fought so hard to protect was given new life as each one plunged . Their only hope would be that the mistakes that had been made would not be repeated again .

4,"I could vaguely hear voices on the other side of the rocks . Everything was still blurry , but I knew what happened . They didn ’ t move with caution throughout the cave . They drug us around like ragdolls , my feet and shins smacking every rock that protruded from the cave floor . I remembered my family , where were they ? I could do nothing but flail my legs around in excitement , trying desperately to locate my wife and daughter . These things were strong ; there was no way I was going to get out of their grip . As my vision came back I could make out day light coming threw some rocks up ahead . I heard voices , human voices above us . Finally I can see her , my daughter ’ s limp body being drug through the rocks to see the mysterious voices on the other side . <newline> <newline> <newline> ( End ) ... There were hundreds of piles of bodies hidden behind the trucks . All of them were dead , there must have been thousands . Out of all those piles I could still pick her out , she was looking right at me . Directly in front of me she laid , and after some time it began to sink in . I wouldn ’ t get to be with them again , the last image I had of her alive was her being pulled from her mother and taken the other direction from me . Now the last thing I will remember will be her big beautiful blue eyes staring back up at me from that pile of lost souls .

4,"Everyone told me I could n't kill him ; I see now that all they really meant was `` should n't '' . The slow trickling of his blood over my fingertips , dripping down my lapels and glistening in my hair felt almost like a reward . I know it 's wrong to kill . I 've always known that , but in this moment , it feels unfathomably right . Not because of what he had done . Not even because of who he had done it to , but because it was over . Her face flickers through my head , just for an instant . The pain in my side is getting more intense now- his knife was sharp , that 's for sure , but mine was sharper . With one hand on my ribs , I slowly raise myself off my knees . Panic strikes me as I hear a siren outside . They 'll understand though , wo n't they ? The judge will pull the old `` No such thing as an eye for an eye '' line , and the jury will nod solemnly , but find me a father in the world who would n't understand what I had to do . They may not condone it , but they 'll understand . They have to . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I know he killed her uncle Tommy . I know why you had to do it .

4,"The colors of the crowd blurred together like lights on a Christmas tree . Each and every one of us had spent years of our lived together . We were ecstatic for the next chapter ; the one we spent strenuous effort and ruthless time striving for . Rows and rows of us were gathered in front of our loved ones . My mind drifted to the sounds of the birds chirping and the indistinct chatter beyond our special moment . This would be remembered forever . It was almost time to be handed the certificate , which defined the rest of my life . My heart raced , while my mind searched for any other stimulus to distract me from how nervous I was . This would affect my life forever , but now I have to go . <newline> <newline> ________________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> <newline> *I ca n't handle this anymore ! * The words rang through my head . I held my head into my knees , which muffled the sound of sobbing from the neighbors who lived above and below me . This was too much . Panic has been settled in my chest for too long . There 's just not enough ! Life is tearing me apart . The world faded out and my surroundings became quiet . I lied down . The bathroom floor was cold on my back . I stared at the ceiling as tears streamed down my face . An empty bottle of pills rested in my hands . My voice sounded raspy as I whispered , `` This will affect my life forever , but now I have to go . ''

4,"Moaze walked in the door and shed his dusty flannel shirt , tossing it to the crooked wooden floor near a stiff-looking armchair . He flopped down on the couch in his spacious living room . A mushroom cloud of more dust erupted from the tattered cushions and settled back into the room with his thoughts . Flipping on the 5 o'clock news , Moaze wondered what he accomplished today . Or this year . As depressed as he was today and most days , Moaze still considered himself an optimist and he was feeling especially optimistic as he drifted into sleep . <newline> <newline> With his finger on the trigger , Moaze 's mind ripped him from the moment at hand . Throwing him years into the past , far from the white-hot lights of this television studio , he was now floating through a familiar dusty room . Couched firmly inside the germ of a great idea , looking forward to the series of events leading him to this day . Here sat the General , sweating like a cold drink and choking on his own collar . The politician wore an obvious scowl with eyes still scheming . Sitting at the same circular glass table with Moaze and the two officials was a famous broadcaster , still impressively collected . It was Moaze who asked the questions this evening . He received the answers he sought and had delivered them to the world . The limit of his power had been reached and his judgment had been cast . With a glance into the camera , and a quick squeeze , a single shot rang out .

That 's my only option to straighten him up . I do n't even know the words to describe how I feel ! I just want my kids to excel , to be the best they can be , and to learn something new and useful from my class- but kids like John that I get every year just make me wonder if this job is worth it . Still , I 'm going to keep teaching . I hope one day John can look back at his behavior and see how bad he is .

At dusk , the smoke becomes just thick enough to render the sky an eery shade of orange to the west while the night sky pursues it , ever gaining , ever pushing the sun from view . Each rolling hill that is crested presents new and marvelous snakes of fire that dance about the hills , calling the fated grassland to its home amongst the sky and leaving nothing but the charred ground to remember it had once existed . There are no trees to obstruct this view , only the smoke that encompasses me like an ethereal vale , hiding me as I wind on down the road . I suppose this is why I have always felt at home here , even surrounded by fire and inhaling the remnants of smoke . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> Something was gone . I frantically kicked the door open and screamed in the hopes to hear a voice return my calls . I ran up the stairs and into both of the bedrooms . Nothing . I prayed to anything that there was a hint , a sign that this was not happening . I found the cell phone with my missed calls on the counter with a note beside it . It was not her handwriting . It read : <newline> <newline> `` You should never start a fire you ca n't contain . '' <newline> <newline> There was nothing left . I slumped to the floor . The smell of smoke was thick in the air .

4,"It was a short and sweet monologue but the trick was to open my mouth . For 22 years of my life have I lived in utter silence as the idea grew within me . I know there were times that I did nothing for weeks on end , lost in development . People asked where I was those weeks , but for reasons unknown I held my tongue . Today was a turning point . Matthias would be the first soul to receive my practiced monologue , calculated to hold interest until the last point was presented . He sat in front of me , waiting , a look of slight worry on his face . I don ’ t blame him . I opened my mouth and began to speak . <newline> <newline> I could no longer feel my legs . The air swarmed around me with a thick , reverberating thunder composed solely of human voices . I was lifted bodily through the swarm . People clawed at me in anger as I passed and my blood flowed down . Matthias had spoken . I was finished . Mere seconds had passed before I reached the center of the cavern and placed on the pedestal . As my body fell limp over the pedestal the mass hushed to absolute silence . I saw Matthias ’ s knife before he drew it ; I had given it to him . He did not speak . The knife plunged into my chest . The cavern shook with the voices of millions of requited humans . My work was complete . <newline>

4,"Fields of dandelions paved the way to a most beautiful and tranquil city , known to the Dwarven people as `` Poczrath '' , a Dwarven term for paradise . In the centre of the city , a bustling trading square covered in mosaics of Dwarven propaganda , stood multiple traders and entrepreneurs selling their goods and each trying to outsell the other person selling to their right and left . One stall would sell simple groceries , and the next , a scorching hot chain mail forge where warriors could purchase their armour for battle ; this was often a common occurrence . Further out , the shops fade and bursting out of the outskirts come fresh and clean housing for the noblemen and Lords . Further still and the middle classes reside in relative comfort . Then came the slums . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> A 34 storey building posed in the middle of the city centre . Bewilderment filled the citizens , with many calling it sorcery and the work of the devil . The building was a stainless steel framed beast , with coloured glass surrounding it 's oddly shaped circumference , it was indeed a thing of wonder and in stark contrast some folk stood in awe . They silently waited for the uses this could have , the materials this could uncover , the designs it could inspire !

Yet anger surged over him , a fortress world had fallen , beneath him cities burned , the empire for the first time in over two millennia had been wounded . The subhuman scum would pay , their filthy blood would paint the soil of countless planet- And just then the reactor of Janau 's capital-class mega cruiser went hypercritical , in the blink of an eye , he was naught but stardust .

4,"I should 've been angry . Or scared . Or bitter . But I was n't feeling it . I was n't feeling much of anything really . It was a bit annoying , to be perfectly honest . I did n't like having so much room to think . At least when you 're angry you can focus on whatever pissed you off instead of wondering what you can do to fix it . But when you 're numb all you can do is stare out the tiny window at the vast wilderness and think . And that sucks when it was thinking that screwed you over in the first place . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> The scenery had n't changed . It was still the same monochromatic grey as it had twenty seconds ago , yet it was different . The subtle shades of green and blue decided to slowly creep out of hiding . I was suddenly aware of the immense exhaustion that had been hanging on my shoulders and I finally broke . Nothing that had happened mattered anymore . None of the pain , none of the fear . The past slid away through the tears on my cheeks . For a brief second I was grateful there were so few passengers on the plane , but the thought was quickly pushed away when I felt a hand on my shoulder .

Dehydrated , surrounded by stone rubble and steel girders , with just enough space for air to come in and out of my miniature cave . Sunlight comes in through a little hole in the top . How funny that once we have failed , the sky has become beautiful . Clouds flowing past me in beautiful arrays . Just then I think I see it , the truth . We were wrong .

Samwell , a small and rather stubborn old man was sitting just outside his hut , gazing into the blue sky . `` What 're doing out there Sam , you 'll get a cold !

Just looking at the sky . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> He kneeled there in the ruins of his former kingdom . The charred corpses of hundreds of villagers lay in the streets all around him . Those that were left had gathered around in complete shock and disbelief . `` How could you do this to us ? '' They each seemed to cry . It was gone . Everything was gone . No one cared for him anymore , he did n't have anyone left . His sons , his wife and his people . They had all forsaken him . Slowly twisting his head , Samwell looked up towards the sky and stared towards the sun . For a brief moment time stopped once more . Like it used too . He was free to breathe . But it was then , when the sun was blocked by the axe swinging down towards his neck that he finally realised , his time had ran out .

4,"I struck the match against the brick wall and lit my cigarette . I heard shouting across the street , it was Benny-Boy again harassing one of his girls . By the time i finished my cigarette scarlet was lying in the street with a bloody nose and black eye , Benny-Boy stood over her shouting some nonsense about how she made him do it and that he loved her . I flicked the cigarette and buttoned my coat and walked over ... <newline> <newline> <newline> ... My nose ran like a river with blood . God damn it that hurt . I picked up the briefcase and headed down stairs . I took his coat in exchange for mine on account of it was covered in his brains now . I walked down stairs and opened the door . It was windy out . <newline> <newline> *Son of a bitch* I thought while staring at the line of men across the street pistols honed in on yours truly . Those bastards had this planned from the start . <newline> <newline> They opened fire . Terrible shots . Enough of them hit me however to land me on my back . The briefcase full of money blew open and I watched powerless as the bills were blown down the street . Is this how it would end ? After all I did to just have it end like this ? Fucks ... <newline>

4,"`` Huh , how much ? '' John held up his new prize . The owner looked up from his book , a bit surprised that anyone was there at all . `` Well ? This is a garage sale , is n't it ? Am I allowed to buy this or what ? '' The man did n't even speak up , just turned the mug over , and pointed to the price sticker , which was hastily slapped on over a small chip in the ceramic . He then returned to his book as John handed him a 5 dollar bill . `` Keep the change buddy . '' <newline> <newline> . . . <newline> <newline> The man in the suit gestured to one of his associates behind him , and accepted a briefcase . `` Look , John , I 'll trade what 's in here , for what you have there . It 's as easy as that , really . '' He smiled . `` Honestly , you 're taking advantage of us . '' John spat out another bit of blood , and tried to straighten his posture . The rope burned against his sore skin , but he managed out the words `` Here . Just fucking take it already ! '' The man in the suit leaned back , expectantly . `` The combination is 462-78-2339 . The mug is there , I swear ! There is a small chip in the ceramic , but it was like that when I found it , honest ! '' The man motioned to his friends , and they all left through the door . He tossed the briefcase at John 's feet , saying `` Here . Keep the change , buddy . ''

4,"This is the Truth . Or at least the Whole of it that I could find . <newline> I stood at a crossroads . One third of my Life had passed . I had seen highs and lows and feasted on as much as my senses could find . I had travelled . I had loved , I had lived . I had learned as the schools saw fit , and I had been employed at jobs filled with promise , that faded to naught . The more I thought I knew , the better I made my plans , the more they crumbled and I was left feeling alone , and lost . Insecure . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Reduced to flesh , this creature , once proud and immortal , felt the crumbling of his bone minute by minute , felt the raggedness of breathe first drawn through lungs newly formed , the shiver of cold through skin grown paper frail . The chill of the chiyl scoured floor did not bother him though , it was the intricate fissures and cracks smashed into it though that did , for it reflected the chaotic state of his own mind , which now felt small and shattered . He looked up , and saw a single ray of light pierce the hole in the ceiling , and wondered to himself , `` where do I begin ... ''

4,"Her footsteps fell in crinch-crunch time on the pavement , creating the rhythm that drove her forward . It was the same path she ran five days a week . As she broke the mental line of the last quarter of her course , she slowed and reached for the active strap on her arm to grab her cellphone . She noticed the sweat reaching for her brown pony tail and running to the small of her back as she dialed . The questionable-looking man parked along the curb noticed too . He oozed out of the driver 's door and made his way to her while she was distracted with her phone call . Her fingers glided over the smartphone and she brought it to her ear . `` Hey dork , its Sarah ... '' she began , not feeling the stranger come within a step or two . <newline> <newline> The lot was bathed in the pulsating lights of the emergency response vehicles . Sarah stood with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders , surveying the scene . As she looked at the girls being checked by the medics she wondered if there were more out there . She noticed Mark in the back of one of the ambulances as well . She hurried through the mist of the fire hoses to check on him . Bandaged and bloody , it looked like the hospital would be his next stop . The EMT slammed shut one of the back doors of the ambulance . Sarah got there just in time to catch the second one before it shut . Before the medic could protest , Mark spotted her and lifted the oxygen mask up to speak . `` Hey dork , take a ride to the ER with me , yeah ? '' he said with a smile .

4,"Jan 5 <newline> <newline> James does n't like me ... I kind of suspected that all along . But Christina kept pushing me to ask him out and I guess it just got my hopes up . So stupid ! Sometimes I wonder if she 's being a good friend or secretly wants me to fail so she can feel better about herself . Maybe I 'm just crazy . Does everyone have these kind of thoughts ? I do n't know and I wish I could talk to someone about it but I do n't know who . Guess that 's why I 'm writing in this silly thing . Well , I 'm off to piano recital . I used to get so nervous for these things but now I 'm just meh ... <newline> <newline> <newline> May 23 <newline> <newline> There 's blood everywhere . I ca n't seem to get every bit out from under my fingernails . Also , I find it in the most random places . The back seat of my car ? I do n't even remember that one . Sometimes I feel like this has gotten out of hand , but then I just go to school and there 's another memorial or candlelight vigil and I feel completely normal . I think probably the scariest part is that no one even suspects me . They 're just so caught up in their own miserable lives and I wonder if they even care about the victims or they just care about how they look in black clothes . I bought bleach today for cleanups but I was n't thinking and used my parents ' credit card . So stupid ! I guess it 's all over when they find Evan 's body anyway . Whatever , if I did n't feel bad about the others I sure as hell wo n't feel bad about him . Well , Christina invited me over so I have to go .

4,"`` So whattya think ? '' <newline> `` Well , I used to be really afraid of death ... not so much anymore . '' <newline> `` Yeah ? What happened ? '' <newline> Kevin stared off into the universe , took 3 seconds to ponder the meaning of life , and looked back toward James . <newline> `` I dunno . I think somewhere along the line I just realized that as long as I was doing something great , something that 's going to be remembered , then if I could go out like that I would n't mind . '' <newline> `` But what if you did n't ? '' <newline> `` Did n't die ? '' <newline> `` No . What if no one remembers you ? '' <newline> `` I 'm okay with that too . Then as long as I was doing something important to me , I 'd be satisfied . '' <newline> `` Hmm . '' James nodded in recognition of his friend 's stance . <newline> `` What about you ? '' <newline> `` Me ? '' <newline> `` Yeah ... how do *you* feel about death ? '' <newline> `` Does n't matter really . '' <newline> `` How so ? '' <newline> `` Does n't apply . '' <newline> `` What , you 're not gon na die ? '' <newline> `` Maybe , maybe not . '' <newline> `` What the hell do you mean *maybe* ? It 's a for sure thing . People dying is a fact ; I 'm sure there are millions of quotes about it . You know ? Like whoever said 'Nothing is promised in life except death ' ? '' <newline> `` I have no evidence that says I will . '' <newline> `` Come on , you ca n't jus- '' <newline> `` **Look** , if you go around thinking about death , you never get the chance to live .

'' <newline> <newline> ******** <newline> <newline> Kevin sat in the foyer of James ' parents home for the first time in a long time . He softly tossed the condolence gift back and forth between his hands resting on his lap . It was more of a formality , this whole process . Visiting his parents , saying that he was there for them , empathy , and so on until the day was over . Kevin was more surprised than anything . James always did what James wanted to do . So his backpacking through Asia was something that everyone encouraged ; everyone expected him to be able to take care of himself . And in that same vein , no one blames anyone for encouraging him to head to China for a quick trip before coming back to the States . No one could have predicted what could have happened . <newline> No one . The flight from Malaysia was supposed to be there within hours , a routine flight . Kevin certainly did n't blame himself . After all , James really knew what he was doing . James did what he said . James did n't die . He disappeared , which without factual evidence or a body , James ' whereabouts would be forever unknown , his status a permanent state of limbo . Kevin never felt sad talking about knowing James . James would now be remembered and as far as Kevin was concerned , was n't dead . After today , Kevin resolved to never talk about James ' disappearance again . If he went around talking about what might have happened , he would never get the chance to live his own life . As far as Kevin was concerned , James would never be dead until James found out for sure . That 's how he resolved to live his life . <newline> <newline> Edit : fucked up the formatting , will fix later .

4,"( it may seem a little disjointed and probably more than paragraph due to most of it being conversational . EDIT also for formatting and I apparently forgot to write a first paragraph ) <newline> <newline> I looked up from my computer . Quickly typed an AFK to some people because I thought I heard a knock at the door . There it was again , no one ever visits at least not at night there was that time the landlord stopped by to let me know the water would be off the next day . Getting up I slowly walked to the door and looked through the peephole . There was just darkness all around . The knocks started again , I quickly pulled the door open . Scott stood there pulling his hand back for some more knocking . <newline> `` Scott ? I thought you were.. '' <newline> `` Yeah I figured I would visit , you always never knew what to do with yourself '' <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> “ She cheated on you with me. ” <newline> Scott stared at me silently for a minute before he spoke , “ With you ? I knew she cheated on me but with you ! ” <newline> I quickly looked around to make sure we were alone in the park . Suddenly this seemed like a bad idea . `` Yes Scott with me . I was meaning to tell you but when I went to you had… ” <newline> <newline> “ I had what ? gone to the store ? Why didn ’ t you tell me ? I mean my best friend could have at least had the balls to tell me he was sleeping with my girlfriend. ” <newline> <newline> “ I couldn ’ t Scott , tell you I mean , you know why the day I went to your house around noon. ” <newline> <newline> “ So , was I sleeping in ? ” His voice was getting louder and more emotional . I knew I should have kept silent . <newline> <newline> “ Scott it was June 22nd . The day I found your body on the floor. ” <newline> <newline> “ I know what the fuck happened June 22nd . I was there you fucking idiot . It was the day after I got fired and life just caught up to me. ” <newline> <newline> “ After I found you and called 911 I let Becky know . I went to the hospital with you . Becky thought I had told you first and we were the reason for your accident. ” <newline> <newline> I could see tears welling up in his eyes . We both sat down at the park bench nearby . Scott was silent so I continued . <newline> “ It was after they said you did not make it that I called Becky a 2nd time . I had did not realize what it would do to her also . After she didn ’ t answer I called her parents , they… . They found her unconscious in the bathtub. ” <newline> <newline> “ Beck ’ s is gone , why didn ’ t you tell me ? Here I thought you had just fallen out.. ” <newline> <newline> “ SCOTT ! You are not listening . Your suicide drove Becky to it also . She couldn ’ t live with herself thinking my night with her was the cause of your death . She didn ’ t realize you had been struggling long before that. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh god , no , how could she ? ” His hands came up and covered his face . <newline> <newline> “ You both left me and I have been struggling these past 5 years trying to live with myself . Everyone blames me for losing you two . Everyone looks at me and wonders at how I could not save either of you . Five years of trying to find a solution and I finally found it. ” <newline> <newline> “ What do you mean Chris ? You found solution ? Can you change the past ? ” Scott looked eagerly at me . <newline> <newline> “ I can not change the past Scott. ” I pulled the gun out of my backpack , “ but I can join my friends . ”

4,"This is from an actual story I ’ m writing : sorry if it lacks the punch of some of these others , but it ’ s not intended to be read this way . I ’ m just curious what people think . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Donovan sighed , pushing back on the wicker recliner as he stretched . He gazed out at the view of the mountain range from his deck , feeling the sun 's warmth sink into his bones . His skin tingled , that last warning before a sunburn , or maybe a sign he was already burning , he was n't sure . He had n't been outside long enough for it to be really bad , regardless , so he ignored it beyond taking a long drink of water from his sports bottle . The morning had been uneventful so far , the whole week really : getting up , taking a run on the wood trails surrounding the estate , doing some weight work just to keep in form , some light reading ... the whole day was some combination of de-stressing and attempting to stay sharp physically and mentally . To relax , and be seen relaxing , while keeping always ready for “ the call ” . Email , really , but it was all semantics . The massages , alcohol , sports , women ... it was white noise , an annoying fuzz he was required to put up with when there was no work to be had , and part of a facade he was forced to maintain as a trust fund socialite passing his prime years in luxury . His real job was his passion , and his life : facilitating the death of other human beings for money . An assassin , of the highest caliber . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> That sound rattled him in a way few things had in recent years . He lay there , letting the high-pitch wine bore into his brain , haunted not by what he had done but by what he had failed to do . Leaving Agent Fields alive was a mistake , and pretending it was only because of some latent emotions he felt for her from the ruse was a worse one . She was a liability , and when she recovered she would come for him , bent on revenge . If she was smart , it would be hard to see her coming . And he had let her live . Longmire was another problem : the man was already driven to bring him down , and Donovan had just handed him a shiny new asset right after cutting the legs out from under his investigation and his career . The once-venerable Marshal Longmire was supposed to end his days in a bottle , dwelling on his complete failure . Instead , now he was surely more focused than ever . With a grunt , Donovan pushed off the bed and switched off the fan , putting an end to the failing motor ’ s wail . He had left enough loose ends that given enough time , they could form themselves into a noose . He would have to come out of the shadows , one last time . <newline>

4,"**This was a story idea I gave up on quite some time ago . Now that I 've actually wrote a little of it , I may just pick it back up . Maybe . ** <newline> <newline> Enormous buildings jut into the sky from the parched Earth that cracks and groans under their weight , the facades peel and sag in the heat of the scorching sun that shines down upon us all . To survive in this world is to know sin in all its forms , committing heinous atrocities against your fellow man simply to see the next day . A lone man treads the sizzling sidewalk as the soles of his bare shoes stick with each step . The streets are lined with men and women seeking a single gold coin for their services or simply for the asking . He ignores them and continues downtown towards a small clinic for his annual checkup . The man greets him earnestly , leading him towards the back room where a small bench is surrounded by all manner of tools . They exchange pleasantries as the doctor conducts the physical only for the conversation to end in an abrupt silence . His next words fall from his mouth into the patient 's ear , though if he had heard it , it did not seem to register . <newline> <newline> _______________________________________________ <newline> <newline> Slender emerald blades shimmer in the summer sun , swaying to and fro in the gentle wind amidst miles and miles of desert . A strong , tall , fruit-bearing shade tree erupts from the grassy atoll , giant arms protecting what little remains of this piece of Eden . It was clear , this visional oasis , even to his weakened eyes that had lost both color and sight . He wept openly , depleting what little liquid remained in his body that had not steamed off in the sweltering heat . Falling to his knees , he uttered only praises and thanksgiving that these arduous months led him closer to the end that he had in mind . He struggled to get back up , his knees and arms shaking terribly under the strain of his pilgrimage and the disease that was near the completion of its course . Feeling the sharp pangs in his gut , his failing limbs , and seeing the paradise ahead , he caught a second wind that pushed him forward . Grasping fistfuls of sand and pushing against the dunes , he ran as best his could towards the glowing body , the mere sight of which had renewed his vigor . Planting his feet on the verdant hillside at last , he stretched forth a feeble hand towards the loving arms in which he hoped to find comfort . His clutch returned only air as he collapsed and breathed no more . As his life came to an end , he heard only these familiar words , *For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God . * <newline> <newline> -040

4,"There was nothing remarkable about the day the world ended . Other than the fact that the world ended , of course . Many people were hardly even aware that they had died . Mutely accepting of another weekday that blends into the indistinct haze of meaningless days years long . Some were obviously aware of the change . Being dead isn ’ t something that you can really overlook when it happens to you . Those are the only two categories people fell into . Those that realized they were dead , and those that didn ’ t . A peculiar end of the world . There wasn ’ t a fiery cataclysm or an alien invasion . Yellowstone didn ’ t erupt and the sun didn ’ t go dark on humanity . Everything just ceased existing as if a great , universe-sized switch had been thrown . Which isn ’ t as far off from the truth as it sounds . It ’ s just not quite a proper analogy . It was more akin to being born . Well , at least for one man . When you are born everything you had known and experienced up to that point ceases and things completely change for you . This is what it was like for John . He immediately realized he was now dead , yet he did not panic or do anything equally useless . Oh there were plenty of people who did panic . No pearly gates or fire and brimstone hell . No reincarnation or guiding spirits . Seeing the afterlife be something completely different from what you believed it would be is unsettling to be sure . John ; however , merely stood staring at the small being in front of him mouth agape and surprise writ large on his face . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> <newline> You should not be afraid of yourself . You will lose much of what makes you you during your time as a creator . I would barely be recognizable to my earlier , lesser self . There are things that I will teach you , but ultimately you must learn most things on your own . Mistakes will be made , of course , and you will still feel emotions they just cease to mean as much as time goes on . You set aside your own being and concentrate on the task you have been given . Just as you did in life so must you do as a creator . Look inside yourself to find what you need . You may not rely on others to live for you in life , and you won ’ t have any outside help going forward . I am weary with burdens of a sort you can not fathom yet . I will answer your questions for a brief time then I must depart and you will be in control . All possible options are open to you . Would you like to get started ? <newline>

Is WRONG WITH YOU ? '' I screamed . Kim had been nearly all smiles twenty seconds before . Like 'oh-we're-ok-so-it's-no-big-deal ' . No-big-deal . Fucking YOLO ! And then she saw my face . I wish she could n't see my face because I knew my cheeks were red and I knew tears were collecting around the warming rims of my eyes . <newline> `` We 're okay ! '' she screamed back . `` Jesus , what are you crying for ? '' <newline> `` I 'm not crying . '' I spat back . A moment ago my hand on her chest was what stopped her from lurching too far forward and cracking her head on the steering wheel , now I felt like putting it back . Around her neck . The car remained stoic , denying having ever put either of us in death 's way , no matter how closely its nose was nudging the metal beam of rail corralling the road against a ditch . <newline> <newline> Her busted , screaming brakes held us back just inches away from sandwiching . The rear tires painted an inky black U in the sleety road . <newline> <newline> The windshield wipers , for whatever reason in the world , had kicked in . Slurring half-melted snowflakes around the glass . The steady shwup shwup shwupping sounds brought me back to Earth and I sat there eyes trained on the dashboard some moments longer . <newline> `` I 'm sorry . I 'm a bitch . '' Kim finally sighed . <newline> `` No , listen- '' <newline> `` You 're so scared . You 're like death-pale . '' I flushed . <newline> <newline> *************************************************************** <newline> <newline> My Sun Child grinned at me . His ruddy cheeks pressed against the bottoms of his eyes for space . <newline> `` You 're happy now . '' And the way he said it was almost teasing . He could see it so easily . He was sure . I grinned goofily right back at him . I wondered if I could get rays of light to shine right out of my face like he could . Was I emanating pure joy too ? <newline> `` Yeah I 'm happy now . '' I whispered and leaned against his side . Arm touching arm . His coil of blond hair fell over his forehead . His blue eyes flicked all around his lids while he watched them move below . <newline> `` Death ... 's not so bad . '' he said to me , but he was telling himself . He watched the busy world of living people . I watched him .

4,"Jimmy sat on the roof of the highest tower , legs dangling off the edge as he gazed upon miles and miles of shifting towers made of organic metals as the rising sun shone reflective patterns off the ever moving walls . His golden locks danced as the wind made waves in his jacket . In the streams of flying cars zoomed like ants in one direction , towards the rising sun . Jimmy , a pale young man followed the lines with his eyes . The further down the line he got , the darker it became . It was just the night he thought as the cars flew faster and faster . It will be light even at the edges soon enough , he told himself . Then he saw it , a brilliant flash of red lightning . Then another and another . His mouth agape as he watched the end of the stream at the edge of the black horizon . Red lightning chasing the stream of zooming cars , hoping from one to the next before its parent darkness swallowed the cars whole . <newline> <newline> Jimmy walked down the pristine halls , no rust , no vomit or blood . Everything so clean , he could almost hear his mother yelling at him for having his shoes on . As he reached for the handle his door , silently , smoothly it opened . Jimmy paused for a moment , he almost missed the rusted squeal of the hinges . He did not miss the omnipresent darkness that welcomed him inside . He looked to the plaque on the door and ran his fingers along his name engraved upon it . COMMANDER J. MCREARY . Slowly he crept into the room , unsure of where he could sit or what he could move . There was a desk and sheet upon a fresh mattress , with a freshly pressed uniform laying upon it . He had more than a speaker with a receiver attached sitting on his desk . He 'd need a deck hand to show him how too use it , but that would come later . He grabbed the uniform and took it too the washroom . The new uniform had such vivid colours and a distinct lack of tears . In the mirrors reflection all he could see , was his decade old uniform , scarcely washed , covered in holes and colours so faded they no longer carried any semblance of his status . He looked himself in the eyes . The eyes no a faded blue , the lips cracked and scared , the scraggly beard , no of it shocked him , but his hair . His once golden locks were gone , replaced by a dirt grey and cut away til they could barely be seen . He sigh as he closed his eyes .

4,"`` Wow '' He said . He stared up at the opalescent tower . It fractured colors so chaotically it 's almost as if it embodied a massacre of rainbows . And it was beautiful . <newline> When he set out to find travel he 'd never realize that his nomadic ways would have him find his way here . He stood there for a moment . Laying down his large backpack . What was in there ? Who was in there ? He asked . He held up his locket he carried with him around his neck . Inside it a picture of his father and him as a young boy . It had a simple note : Find the place where the colors die , Haszcvolt . Love , Dad . He pondered a moment . Simply remembering the days when his father would give him stories of a place which contained all the world . A gate . To everything , and everywhere . Haszcvolt took a deep breath . He strengthened his resolve . He closed his locket , the same opalescence as the tower , and took it off . In the middle of the tower 's fractal doors laid a keyhole fit for one thing . With a second 's thought , Haszcvolt put the locket into it , and pushed open the iridescent doors . <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> He 'd done it all . He 'd become every king and every ruler and every emperor . He 'd slain every demon and every angel . He 'd played all gambits and all the perils . And he 'd won it all . Through the door to everything was everything . Haszcvolt was no longer himself . In the quest to live a million lives , he forsake the one given to him . What was his name ? What was he doing here ? The last thing he 'd remember was opening a door that led to literally everything . Everywhere . Every time . Every one . And what did he do ? He did n't know . He laid there on the ground in the grass . The sky was simple to his eyes , it was beautiful . Funny out of all the lives he 'd lived , this one , was his favorite . He heard a sound . He slowly crept up and looked at the tower doors from where he laid . And he saw a familiar boy about to open the door to existence itself . <newline>

4,"OK folks . First post so please be kind ... . <newline> <newline> Marcus sat back and examined the white walls surrounding the room as he took the last drag off his cigarette . He slowly blew the smoke out through his nose and dumped the cigarette butt into the coffee cup on the table in front of him . He watched as the smoke slowly rose and danced around the celling before it clung to the florescent lights . <newline> He stood up and walked over to the mirror that dominated the opposite wall where he was sitting . The reflection astonished him . How long had it been since he had a good night sleep he thought ? He leaned his head back slightly and scratched his chin . <newline> “ Last Friday ’ he said out loud and looked back into the mirror . <newline> A voice boomed over a hidden loud speaker “ Take your seat ” . <newline> Marcus stared at his reflection , raised his right hand and flipped his middle finger .

John was laying on the ground , his arms outstretched and hands up as blood oozed out of the cut across the side of his face . <newline> “ You do n't have to do this ” John said . <newline> <newline> “ Oh but I do . ”

4,"Donald Kensworth stepped out into the dim morning light , silently closing and locking his apartment door behind him . The gray cloudy sky did little to brighten his mood . His morning cup of coffee gripped in one hand and briefcase clutched in the other Donald made his way to his car . It was still somewhat early and Rosewater street was still quiet . Donald set down his coffee and rubbed at his darkened eyes . He searched through his bedrazzled attire for a moment looking for his keys . Checking the pockets of his old black slacks and wrinkled blue dress shirt yielded nothing however . It was several more moments before he realized that his keys had been held in the hand with his coffee . Despite this momentary setback everything seemed normal to Donald . It was just another ordinary day in his average life . However , Donald would soon find that today would prove to be much *much* more than ordinary . <newline> <newline> As Donald stood at the edge of the abyss watching the end of existence unfold before him he felt a bittersweet sense of contentment . Perhaps the end of the universe would n't be all that bad , after all he did have her . Turning to his left he gazed upon his violet haired companion , her face lit by the dying flares of nebulas and stars . She had been the one to open his eyes and start him on this journey ; this impossible quest . Together they had traversed space and time , seen other dimensions , encountered beings greater than gods , and saved reality itself . Throughout all of this she stayed by his side and anchored his sanity when the things he saw would have drove him mad . It was only at this moment , when galaxies collided with infinity , that he realized how much he truly loved and valued her . His long time childhood friend , whom he had thought dead , came back to him and became his guide into the wonders of the cosmic unknown and even more than that became the woman he loved . Vera turned and smiled at him and the expression on her face was the most luminous and beautiful sight he had seen , greater and more glorious than the grandest sights of all the realms . And that smile gave him comfort . As the old world ended all he could think of was spending eternity with her .

4,"`` Are you abit afraid ? '' She asked , `` yea ... I 've snuck out before , but not with the car '' I said , `` that does n't make me feel better ... '' So I sarcastically replied with `` well then in that case no I 'm not scared '' `` haha shut up ! Do n't lie to me '' we were driving to our old school that we attended as kids only this time it was at 11pm on some nostalgia trip kind of date . When we got there we headed to the playground which was the most significant location that we had our best memories other than the classrooms . We both hopped on the jungle gyms and the swings before she challenged me to a race on the soccer field in order to see who could reach the other end first . I went easy on her , and let her win so I could run up behind her and lift her in the air , unfortunately I tripped after I picked her up and she ended up on top of me . Both of us laughing our ass off before that weird awkward silence in the end , so Instead I decided to go for the kill and kiss her there ; best first date I ever had . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I got it okay ? I know ! I almost ruined your life , but I 've been trying to make it better '' I said to her hoping she 'd know I wanted more time `` I appreciate you trying but this is n't about you ! You just still do n't understand '' she said . I was pretty sure I was unprepared in order to say the right words in order to get her to stay but I think she made up her mind since the incident . Every time it was my turn to talk I knew it was pointless to do so , but there I was saying things I would later regret wondering wether or not bullshit would 've been a better option . She hated liers so me `` vowing '' my honesty to her was a dead giveaway that I was not to be trusted . So she broke up with me taking all the blame knowing I would find ways to hate myself over her ; if you ask me the 100 grand I stole sure is helping me cope

4,"`` You got ta realize kid , it 's the journey that matters . That 's all that ever does . No one finds answers at the end ... In death . '' The old man smiled amiably at me . Being me and the young idiot I was , I could n't or would n't understand . He died two days later , that old heart finally gave , dropped out like the engine on an old Ford with nearly three hundred thousand miles . That was it , he was gone and with him went that peaceful smile . I missed him for awhile , but eventually ... Well you know how it is , life moves on . <newline> <newline> . . . <newline> <newline> The house was bathed in that late twilight blue . The kind that makes it all dreamy looking . I could n't see the old rug that I hated so much and that was all it took . As I fell I heard my knees crack on that old washed wood floor . I yelled out in pain as my body followed them down , finally succumbing to that relentless force of gravity that 'd been pulling on me since the day I was born . No one heard my yell , or my cries for help . I was an old man now and alone . The culmination of everything I was in life coalesced into these final moments . How terrible it is to die alone ; no children to carry on my memory , no friends to mourn me , no pet to comfort me . They were all gone , or never existed in the first place . As I laid there slowly hemorrhaging out the remainder of my life I realized with sudden clarity that this is what I 'd sowed . My whole life pushing people away , because the ends justified the mean and the mean was always money . My long lost love , the one who gave me that ugly rug , who I abandoned out of selfishness . I always thought there would be more time . `` No one finds answers at the end ... In death . '' An old man with a amiable smile once told me . I realized this too late , but you know what they say , life moves on ...

4,"Picture if you will the harsh but beautiful coastlines of a Scandinavian fjord in early summer . Near the end of the fjord , where the steep cliffs give way to rolling hills , picture a small viking village . At the far east end of the village , near the smithy and not too far away from the berth , picture a small viking hut , painted completely in red and encircled by strange looking wooden totems . And finally on the small wooden bench in front of the hut picture a young , viking in his early 20s , flowing long blond hair , full blond beard , nervously rocking back and forth , tapping his foot , his fist clenched around the small bronze idol that would reveal his place in life to him and the whole village . He 's been sitting here for over 3 hours now , as have his brothers , friends , and ancestors before him . Finally the red door opens with a screech and a wave of incense , smoke and odors rolls over the young man . `` Enter , Bjorn . It is time to meet your destiny . '' <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> `` Is it customary for your people to leave without saying goodbye , Protector ? Or have we offended you ? '' Bjorn nearly dropped the fuel cell he was heaving into the Orca 's cargo bay . Damn those sneaky Ryconians . `` Please stop using that stupid title , it makes me feel like those pompous generals at the reception . '' He stashed away another crate of rations , flipped a switch , and the cargo hatch closed . `` Then what would you like me to call you instead ? '' . `` How about friend '' , Bjorn answered and shook Dvelin 's paw . The Rycoian grinned . `` Too bad '' , he whistled . `` As Protector you could take one of the royal cruisers for a little spin . Would n't that make for a much more glorious homecoming that this little rust bucket ? '' . The human chuckled . `` I 've always preferred small and nimble ships '' , he said as he opened the Orca 's airlock . `` Farewell , my friend . '' `` Farewell , viking . ''

4,"It was the weekend after a long week . I had finally finished the project at work that I had been working for 6 months -- six very long months -- and now I was enjoying some well-deserved relaxation time . I finished reading the back page of the latest `` Entertatinment Weekly '' cover -- the one with Jennifer Lawrence in full Mystique makeup on the cover -- and flipped the magazine over , deciding to watch TV instead . Flipping channels , I found an X-Men movie . I watched for a few minutes , trying to determine which one it was , and that 's when it happened -- the photo on the front cover of the magazine started to move -- or did it ? Nah , I must be imagining things . And then it happened ... the photo came to life and jumped off the page ! <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> As I stood in awe , looking up at the spaceship , I felt a pang of sadness . I was going to miss her . Miss the adventures we had together . She always seemed like a villain in the movies ; but I knew better now . She was just misunderstood . <newline> <newline> `` Here , take it , '' she said , giving me the device I had been eyeing since I 'd met her . `` I know you want it . '' <newline> <newline> `` But -- but do n't you need it , '' I stammered . <newline> <newline> `` Not anymore . You 'd better get really familiar with that , because as of now , you invented it . '' <newline> <newline> And with that , she boarded the spaceship . I watched as the gangway was raised and the ship took off , knowing that our tales of epic adventure were something I had best keep to myself if I did n't want to end up in the nut house . After all , who would believe me anyway ? <newline>

4,"`` Do you want to hear about the day I woke up ? '' The cigarette burned in his mouth , always burning , ashes falling listlessly from it 's end into the night that engulfed them . He shifted from foot to foot impatiently , like the idea of standing still was too much for his body of perpetual motion to bear . `` Do you want to hear about the day I turned immortal and became a god ? '' He said it all with the cigarette still in his mouth , bumping along to the cadence of his voice , ashes continuing their death march into oblivion . `` No , I suppose not . Not everyone likes those stories . Seems these days no one likes those stories . It 's all feel good moments and happy endings for them . No one likes the ones that make you question anymore . No one likes the ones that make you think . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Do you want to hear about the day I woke up ? '' There was no cigarette this time . The snow that floated around them seemed a poor imitation of the ash from before . His voice seemed almost broken , that confident cadence no longer bumping the long gone cigarette . He spoke to a different man this time , sang a different tune . `` Do you want to hear about the day I turned immortal and thought myself a god ? '' The snow seemed a counterweight to him , it 's constant movement contrasting how completely still he was . He stood slightly stooped , like a weight was bearing him down . The perpetual motion was gone , in it 's place stood unending stillness . `` No . No , I suppose not . Not everyone needs to bear the burden . That 's what they do n't tell you about the apple and the snake . It 's not the snake that 's the bad guy , he 's just opening your eyes . The real evil is that fucking apple . The real evil is in the bite , not the hiss . ''

4,"The void and the room were one . Far from the world , the world that was the center of the universe , the point that the rest of creation rotated around , was the room , cloaked in darkness . It had been this way for centuries . A quiet , cold tomb . Without warning , a burst of light appeared within the room , casting its features into sharp relief . The void recoiled from the light , before it gathered itself and rushed forwards , intent on reclaiming the room for the darkness . For a moment , the light appeared overwhelmed , before four more lights burst into being , obliterating the darkness and filling the room with a rainbow of colors . <newline> <newline> `` We are all here , it seems , '' the golden light began . <newline> <newline> ~~~ <newline> <newline> The King sat upon his throne , gazing out over his Kingdom , the body of the former ruler cooling at his feet , his new and loyal subjects kneeling before him . He reached out his consciousness and focused , his mind seeping into the waking world before him . He became the heartbeats of the courtiers who supplicated before him . He became the wind gusting through the trees outside . He even became the two who had defied him and yet lived . But more than all of them , more than he was even himself , he was the Earth , and the abominations locked within it . He smiled a slow , feral smile , making a list of priorities . First , he would force the rest of the world to kneel before him . Then , he would find those who dared oppose him . Then , with the might of the world behind him , he would do what not even the gods could do , and face the darkness hidden within the world . He settled back and smiled at all he sensed , for it was good . <newline> <newline> ( Had to use three to get the dialogue in , sorry ! )

4,"First time posting on reddit . No idea why . <newline> <newline> <newline> The winter affects some people differently , I mean a real winter . The kind that lasts most of the year , that reaches such a bitter low that one tends to feel abused by it . Sometimes I have heard it called Seasonal Affective Disorder , sometimes The Winter Blues , but the cold and darkness can get inside a person if they 're not careful . Me , I try to focus on people instead of the weather . I find it helpful to imagine the `` climate '' of a room based upon the human interactions and activities occurring in and around it , except that unlike actual weather I can make changes as I see fit . <newline> . <newline> . <newline> . <newline> . <newline> . <newline> . <newline> . <newline> <newline> The woman puffed out her cheeks and tensed her shoulders at the words `` vagina bacon '' , and it was clear as day what was coming . I moved one foot backwards , away from the counter , prepared to shift quickly when it came time , and continued . <newline> `` The only problem with vagina bacon is the delivery . You would n't want your steak served on a cotton plate , cotton is a desiccant . Same reason you do n't want your vagina bacon wallowing in a pad all afternoon , or perched on top of a tampon just waitin ' for the grill ... '' <newline> And on the word 'grill ' she cough-puked all over the DMV counter , the keyboard , and a pile of various forms and letters , uttering what sounded like errrssSTAWWWbbbBITgergh . By the third or fourth wretch I was out the door and into the fresh air , a noticeable spring in my step , when I looked down on my shirt sleeve and saw what appeared to have been a piece of caramelized onion . I flicked it into the cold grey slush of the parking lot and smiled at the setting sun .

4,"From the second he opened his eyes that morning , Andy knew it was going to be a good day . He could sense it . Today was the day ! The day his boring , meaningless , self-proclaimed-pity-party of a life would change forever . Everything felt perfect , like the way he had always wanted it to . The way the light came through his windows , the way the carpet felt on his feet as he lifted himself up out of bed - which in itself was unusually effortless . His coffee was the perfect temperature , he got the best spot in the usually impossible parking lot at his job , and he somehow mustered up the courage to talk to Angela for the first time since the Rio affair . It was this same strange optimism that led him to notice the sign in the window of the convenience store he passed every single day but never paid much mind . `` Press your luck ! Buy a ticket ! '' the sign said . Andy smiled , and gladly obliged . <newline> <newline> As he watched the truck pull off into the distance , the last of his belongings crammed into the back , an overwhelming sense of calm came over him . He even laughed a little bit . How fast one can go from thinking they have nothing to having everything and back to nothing . But this time he really had nothing . It was just him , in the middle of the road , drenched from the rain , staring into the future . A year ago he would have rushed home to get dry . But not now . Now he was different . The cold wet clothes he had on now felt better than any of the freshly tailored designer clothes he had grown so accustomed to wearing ever had . Now he was happy , and he knew it ; and with a smile and a deep breath , he took the first step forward towards the rest of his life .

4,"Alison knew she was dying . He , her uncle , hushed her and patted her ebony curls every time she asked , telling her that little girls should not think such dark thoughts . She was very sick , yes , but not dying . He 'd make her better , he just needed her to keep smiling her pretty smile . She 'd pout or scowl , a glint in her sapphire blue eyes , and tell him that she was not a little girl , and she did n't need babying from her uncle . Such a grown up little darling , not a typical nine year old at all . No , even at such a young age , she was smart , she was fiery , she was *beautiful* . That , he knew , was going to either kill her , or save her . <newline> <newline> Angel heard the screams before she felt the pain spreading slowly through her body . The world slowed around her as her knees hit the pavement first , then the ground met her face . Still , she was numb , but now gradually becoming aware of the wet , warmth flowing from her chest . She could taste metal in her mouth too . This , this was bad . No , she was n't getting out of this one this time . She tried to speak , to apologize , but the words were catching on the blood in her throat . A small gurgle was all that made it past her lips . Her vision was fading out , just as the sky appeared briefly again , and she was enveloped by a warm , familiar scent . The man who 'd saved her all those years ago was shouting at her , begging her to hold on . A fragment made it through the haze . *Hurt , my love , not dying . * <newline> A smile spread itself across her lips . Alison knew who Adam reminded her of now .

4,"There was a long pause before Isabelle spoke . “ You know what has to happen , ” she murmured , then folded her hands on the table as her glowing turquoise eyes locked on her father-in-law . The rest of the room , her husband included , seemed to fall away as she summoned the courage to say the rest . But they all had to be thinking the same thing… right ? “ We need to kill her… and as her husband , I think *you* need to be the one to end her , Bastian . Mary ’ s too far gone now. ” <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> Rain fell hard around them as Mary drew in a deep breath and looked down at her beloved . Could he remember the good times they shared ? Their children ? The little house by the waterfall ? As if he could read her thoughts , his demonic eyes seemed to pierce into her and look -- really look -- at his fallen angel , and a soft expression of love and recognition suddenly fell over his features . A small gasp escaped his lips and it was all she could do not to run away . Why ? Why did he have to remember now ? `` Bastian ... '' she whispered . `` I love you . You knew that , right ? I have always loved you . I will always love you . '' Fat tears spilled from her eyes as she watched his expression shift from calm and peaceful to shocked and pained as Mary pressed her dagger into his chest , breaking the skin to wedge the blade into his rib cage and sink into his heart . For what seemed like hours , his gasps harmonized with her whimpers as she watched the life leave her Bastian to join the countless other souls he 'd sent into the afterlife . `` I love you , '' she repeated , `` and I will see you in hell . ''

4,"Clark scratched at the itchy fabric that tugged incessantly at his neck . Dress shirts were never his style ; he preferred a comfy t-shirt and slacks to the business formal attire that he had donned for the day . But , when duty calls , you answer . Or in Clark 's case , you try to run away the first opportunity you can , only to be dragged back to reality by the two burly `` negotiators '' the government had sent to `` persuade '' him to their cause . He had never been very patriotic , but when threatened with a life-long sentence under house arrest , he supposed he could dredge up some loyalty to his country . Sighing to himself , he spoke to the president , `` So , when do I start ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> <newline> No feeling left in his left arm . His right arm was draped over his bloody shoulder , desperately trying to keep pressure on the wound . The pain was n't as strong as he thought it 'd be , but maybe that 's because he was still feeling groggy from that surprise hit he took from the back of the head . Biting on his lower lip , he felt the blood dripping down his lip and dirt-caked chin , and a small surge in consciousness . He had only one chance left to redeem this hopeless situation . It was all Anna 's sacrifice had bought him . He hoped to God it would be enough . Walking past the bodies strewn around the doorway , he dragged himself to the control console . He spared one last thought to all the countless millions that would die with this decision , but damned if he cared anymore about the consequences . He flipped back the caution glass and slammed his fist down on the blinking red button . *sayonara good-old US of A . *

4,"To reach the next stage of intelligence , that was our aim . To create a new form of consciousness was our pursuit which we chased with the intensity of a hound . Some would say we were blinded by our hunt , that we had little regard for the ramifications of what could occur . Others thought we would n't be capable of responding as soon as it came to fruition . In truth we were n't ready , but not in a predictable sense . Emotion , morals , our understanding of the mind is as rooted in our flesh and blood as our mental states are affected by such rudimentary elements . We were n't prepared to confront the enormity of our creation ’ s descendants . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> It was more palpable than a sense of abandonment . The warmth of a departed partner , the silence of a vacated conversation , nothing compared to our new experience . Man has strived since time immemorial to understand our surroundings , to reveal the universe as we can experience it . And through this we have searched for gods , explanations for not just the how of our existence but further the why . To find that we would give birth to gods , transforming the world in ways not imagined before , it provided such a sense of purpose . If the universe can not be our playground surely it could belong to our offspring , whatever form they may take . We anticipated a departure , even one without us . We had little dreams of such treacherous journeys . But learning that your omnipotent caretakers , whose birth you partook in , would not leave any trace behind , it was impossible to fathom . We became orphans to our children who left for the stars . <newline>

For the first time in my life I can say I fell in love . As I gathered my words to talk to the suave koy nature I thought was befitting of me fell into a strewn incoherent rambling in nervousness `` Hello ! My name is Juan , .. errr I mean John unless your into Spanish guys then I 'm Juan '' Damn I ruined it . She just chuckled to herself stuck her hand out for a handshake and calmly mentioned `` My name 's Grace your cute . '' <newline> <newline> As I fell to my knees in a pool of blood my mind was drawn to the glow she used to have . `` It 's my fault , It 'd my fault . '' kept ringing and ringing in my head . I loosened the grip on my ax and my sense came without it . I started laughing maniacally . I forget was she the crazy one or me ? It was a slippery slope to this moment . The police lights and sirens drew closer as I contemplated killing myself too but , I knew it had to be done she and the baby inside her was a monster .

It was the same in every district , most of the residents were gathered in the bunkers while a few men stayed out to gather the most they could to last for the next six or seven months . After several years of this new phenomenon , those who had survived organized themselves efficiently to ensure their survival . The near fields to the compound were always planted with late season crops , because they were to be the last crops gathered for the year . <newline> <newline> * <newline> * <newline> * <newline> <newline> <newline> By this time , the gate guards were given the order to shut the gates , and sealing Beasley ’ s fate .

The system had given her and her father accommodations in the district ’ s bunker along with a dozen other broken families . It has now been over nine years since the tearful goodbyes were said . The system was fair , and it worked . Random families were selected for the bunkers , but some families were larger than others , so out of each family selected , a random parent , and a random offspring would be allowed savior .

After six long years , and countless failed attempts , Mr. Baker leaned forward in his chair , internally as giddy as a child on his first Halloween , staring at the vial containing his life 's greatest work . The end-all to the suffering . The beginning to the greatest bound in human evolution . Mr. Baker 's reaping was now done . Now began the sowing . After a few moments of capturing his room on film to document this event , Mr. Baker called up his friend to tell him the amazing news . <newline> ___ <newline> The room settled , slowly . A torn bedspread nailed to the far wall had light peering through it , silhouetting the figure in the middle of the room . The swept up dust swirled in the sun stream . A few continuing experiments began to bubble over on the desk to the left ; their contents oozed out , smearing the scribbles of Mr. Baker 's last notes . I fell to my knees . I could only think how close Mr. Baker had been to saving us all again . But to ask a man to do God 's work twice was our greatest blunder . The last thing I heard was my own involuntary sobbing , followed by a piercing shrill- the sound of a falling bomb about to destroy the house .

Johan Brauner had inherited the farmland that bordered this stand of trees moved in just as the last frost of winter lay on the ground . In need of wood for repairs and ignorant of local lore he chopped down the oak trees and began to prepare the wood . Needless to say the Red Bear orc tribe was none too pleased . <newline> <newline> So here I stand at the end of a secret pass into a valley filled with a burning village , hundreds of destroyed farmsteads , and ten thousand dead orcs .

He hoped that this would be the beginning of the rest of his movie , but nothing ever happened when the fog cleared . Until today , when he met Zoey . <newline> <newline> He held her hand while looking out of the window . Surrounded by the sterile interior of the `` hospital '' , as they called it . Outside bird chirped and people stood completely still , or ran around aimlessly . One was yelling at a tree . If this was the price of them together , he would gladly pay it . Who 's to say if she is real . She felt real to him . That was enough .

4,"They lived in isolation from maturity to adulthood . In the years since the disease which had wiped out most of humanity , people reverted to a primal state . Children were raised to maturity and then sent out on their own to hunt , kill and survive . Every now and again two humans would cross paths . Sometimes it would end in violence .

Mankind lived like beasts beneath the crumbling ruins of their mega-cities . <newline> ... <newline> They walked arm in arm towards the city , saying nothing .

She clasped his hand in hers , after wiping off the blood onto his shirt . He opened his mouth to speak , but instead coughed up blood . She held her hand to his mouth . `` Quiet . It 's over . Just let it come . '' The look of confusion in his eyes was starting to fade away , as they began to lose focus and glaze over .

4,"That morning on the way to school was a haze . There was nothing extraordinary about it ; rising early enough to eat an unhealthy breakfast and truly savor the below-freezing temperature of his car was more of a ritual than an accident . But that 's just it - that word would take on a whole new meaning later that day , and when it did , he would have no reason to remember the way to school . <newline> <newline> - <newline> <newline> *I should n't be intimated the way he talks , * I thought , looking up at the broad frame of disapproval and anger , *or how he acts . So why am I ? * And then it hit him , that *Holy shit , * I 'm *in the wrong here . * And he was , in the wrong , and he was admittedly screwed .

4,"She had something . Siam had no idea what is was , but it captivated him . Was it her long , dark-as-night brown hair ? Was it her way of walking , with that constant air of superiority ? There was no explanation to what she made him feel , but he knew it was something that would last a long time . <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> Blood everywhere . There was a lot in the floor , some splattered in the walls , two stains getting bigger in his shirt . He turned around and walked to his chair , painfully lowering his body to sit on it . He wrote on a piece of paper in his desk . The last thing he saw was that piece of paper with some badly written words . `` I did it for y '' .

4,"It all started 14 days ago , when she left me for that asshole down in 223 . 14 days since I spoke with anyone , 14 days since I last stepped foot outside .

She did n't even bother telling me that she was cheating until that fight 14 days ago . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> While I do n't particularly like the cool metal bars or the desolate toilet , I 've gotten used to it .

4,"The window raised open and the figure of a boy , wth both practice and grace , slid into the room . He slipped under the cold covers of the bed and waited . There was silence . A silence that David had grown a custom to . He knew he should n't go out that late . But he had to . He felt himself being drawn to the world outside this cage they all called home . <newline> <newline> As the blood pooled in the crotch of his pants the sense of hopelessness that had once been forgotten came over him like a brewing tempest . Knowing that there was nothing left David took the gun and squeezed the trigger with such ease , painting himself against the backdrop . He lay there lifeless draped upon the only thing he ever loved .

4,"The cold night air swept past me . I was running , hastily , toward the dim light of the town . My heels were wet with snow , and I was beginning to notice the nip at my fingertips . My face , coated with the spectacle that is snow , made it rather difficult to see . I managed , however . I must do this , I must ... 3 days to go . <newline> <newline> Obviously , I never expected it to occur . But hell , it did . I think I did alright . Sure , I made a few mistakes , but I did it .

4,"As he took his final steps out of the enormous room he had spent so many years in , Carl stopped to savour the sounds of billions of dollars being made and lost , of masculine banter , of phones ringing , on keyboards clacking away and of the American dream . He was so thankful for what it had given him . <newline> <newline> Carl 's dedication stayed firm , enraging the two FBI officers that hovered over his bed .

4,"It was my day off , and I decided to drive around randomly to find adventure . No GPS , no map . I just wanted to see where it would take me if I went purely on whim . So on the highway , I drove past the exit I normally used and went ahead by another three exits . The road from the offramp went left , right and straight . <newline> <newline> <newline> She hid her eyes under her raincoat as the firefighters put out the last embers in the apartment . Her hands trembled as she dropped the revolver into the storm drain and looked at me one last time , before vanishing into the crowd .

The man , no Demi , that is in charged of my de-humaization lead me through the building . It was ugly . Or the Demi 's would believe it too humane . The Demi sat me down and strapped me none too gently onto the table . I was immediately greeted with a slash of pain . I could feel the warmth of the blood dripping onto table .

I could feel my consciousness fading , it was cold . <newline> <newline> 'What is your name , Sir ? ' <newline> <newline> 'John Smith . '

4,"It 's another foggy day out in the open waters . We 've been floating in the pacific for three weeks without seeing any land for us to rebuild our main mast . It was damaged in our last battle and we 've just been free floating . We lost 32 people out of our 67 person crew and I 'm not sure how much longer we 'll be able to float before we run out of food and water <newline> <newline> I 'm fatigued to fatigued to leave the raft even though I have reached mainland .

The moment it awakened and made eye contact with me , I knew that Model 45 would change the world . <newline> ... <newline> I heard my son screaming upstairs , but I was completely powerless to help him . I was tied with industrial-strength chain to a support beam in my basement . My wife lay dead across the room from me , with her head injuries almost making her unrecognizable .

4,"4 , 8 , 15 , 16 , 23 and 42 . The numbers were playing over and over in my head and hey would n't stop . I later heard that the Powerball was over $ 450 Million and I went to buy a ticket .

4,"I had n't planned on coming back after getting on the motorcycle . At the time I realized I was in love with a woman who sells herself , and I was simply unable to pry myself away from her . I had to leave . I had to go far away from her . To the other side of the world if I had to . <newline> <newline> <newline> When I left Bangkok that morning it was 100 degrees and humid . As the bus pulled in to the familiar parking lot in my home city , I saw the telltale signs of winter . The trees , the power lines , even the sidewalks , were all covered in ice . It was sub-zero temperatures and all I had was a grey hoodie , a pair of light pants , and my backpack . I went around the world to get away from her , but hers was the first face I would see when I got back .

4,"`` Oh , really ? And what makes you so sure ? '' Emma responded playfully . Max 's breath caught in his chest . He looked back at her incredulously , waves of hurt and shock sweeping across his face like darkness across the twilight sky . This was supposed to be it . This night , this restaurant , this moment - it was supposed to be *everything* . He could n't speak , could n't think , could n't even see the pale , shining silverware glittering in the candlelight , mocking him just like she was . <newline> <newline> . <newline> <newline> Emma stopped suddenly , eyes fixed at something in front of her , groping blindly for Max 's sleeve . `` Wait , no - I thought we 'd make it !

But before Emma could begin to cry , Max took her in his arms and , at the same moment the young man 's heart ripped in two , kissed her with the same passion she had once denied him . So it was that they painfully faded from time and space that night .

4,"Tim thought to himself that he 'd never find another friend like Matty . The two had been close since grade school and here he was bailing him out of trouble - again . Tim was always the quieter of the two but was always managing to get himself in sticky situations . Once he tried to play a prank on his babysitter by leaving a little note that said `` HELP !

Norma wrapped her arms tightly around Tim 's neck and whispered `` Do n't worry , Timmy . I know everything .

4,"I pulled hard to close the barn door , having to fight against the relentless blowing of the wind that came through at dusk every day . I turned , covering my eyes as a gust kicked up a small amount of snow into my face . As I lowered my hands my eyes only widened . What looked like a meteor was shooting down from the sky directly for my house . A piercing howl rang out , gradually getting louder the closer it drew . I could feel my jaw clenching , as I clamped my hands over my ears to some how mitigate the noise , as if in anticipation of the impact . I looked up just in time to see it strike into the ground . I did n't even register the shockwave as I was sent flying back into the barn door . Then nothing . <newline> <newline> ___ <newline> <newline> I ’ d finally goofed .

4,"Sitting nervously at the table now deemed `` losers corner '' , I looked to my lunch bag , gazing into the paper container , a slight smile as I looked upon the saran wrapped pastrami sandwich , pringles and gatorade . Sure , my friends had all graduated before me , sure I now sat alone and yes ... I was now labeled a loser by the rest of the students but hey ... at least I made one hell of a lunch right ? Right ? Yeah , got ta look at the silver lining . <newline> <newline> I stood before the crackling fire , the shades of orange and red dancing in everlasting finality . I was silent , even as I used a branch that fell from a nearby tree to poke the tinder , urging a splash of cinders to rise from the reaction . Beside me , Clare smiled warmly , patting the empty spot beside her . I obliged and sat , taking her hand . Together we stared into the flame , watching bone turn black with ash . He put up a fight . However two on one was never fair for him . Now he burned with the rest of his brethren . Clare and I made sure of it . <newline> <newline> Edited for spelling

4,"Sitting at his desk listening to his boss yell at him for the fifth time this week , all he could think of was how good it would feel to punch his boss in the face and walk out of there . He had a presentation due on Monday and was not making the progress that leadership wanted . He would have to work the weekend , again . He had n't had a weekend free to himself in almost a year . Between working long hours for the firm and meetings with the divorce lawyer on what seemed like a weekly basis , he was constantly being told not only when to jump , but also how high . <newline> <newline> It was close , only 100 more feet or so . He could n't believe it , harnessing the adrenaline pumping through his body , he clenched the cold steel through his gloves . One foot in front of the other , thats all he had to do . `` You can do this , you are doing this , you did this . '' A few more steps . Finally at the summit , he fell to his knees , the vast expanse of the Karakoram Range spread before him . He had done it , he planted his flag atop K2 .

In truth , I did n't know what was going on either , but I pulled her close and smiled a little . <newline> `` It 's gon na be fine , you 'll see . The cops are already on their way . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> I 'd always enjoyed cleaning my gun . There was something ironically peaceful about it . Cathartic . Not this time though . She was rattling the door .

It was OK though , cause at least I had Meg . I finally forced myself to look at her . She snarled at me , bits of dead flesh beginning to hang off her face . I raised my gun . Just two bullets left . Just enough .

4,"She rose with the sun , her shirt hanging loosely draping off her shoulder . She swam in a sea of blankets , the sunlight poured through the window and heated the salt watered cloud of sheets and comfort . She rubbed the sleep from her eyes , throwing the sea and warmth away . Grabbing her glasses from the nightstand she made her way down stairs , the smell of fresh coffee permeated the air . `` Seems like dads up already , '' she said to nobody in particular . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Finally it was over , Sam stood and looked over the battlefield . Kyle lay dead before her , and it took every ounce of strength she had left not to spit on his corpse . The sun was coming up over the horizon , and casted an eerie glow over the fallen . She let out a sigh , and grabbed the radio from her belt . `` Chris , let them know it 's over , they 're safe now . '' The radio chirped and died with her final transmission . She slung her rifle over her shoulder and walked into the sunset , there was no place for her here , and today held a new beginning and would breathe new life .

4,"A bright flash of green , he heard , was the only visual marker of the machine 's activation . They were from the radial diffraction of gamma rays which briefly hit his retina during acceleration . Looking up , he saw the chamber doors close 100 feet above , and knew there was no backing out . But why would he back out ? Go back to a world that still did n't believe in the value of his work ? Just then , he felt the spin initiating , and braced for the journey . <newline> <newline> He knew it was inevitable . The computer 's worst case scenario could n't have predicted anything near to the destruction on his own hands . He knew he had gone too far trying to cheat the universe itself . Entropy , he thought . He had attempted to best something a high school student could explain to him . It makes no difference what happens to me now , if the machine takes control , he thought . He had just finished arming the nuclear device , and dropped it into the chamber . A bright flash of green hit the corner of his eye before he sealed the hatch , and he waited for the universe to decide his verdict .

You can imagine our shock when we found him dead . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> I dropped to my knees . It was finally over , but in the end , the bastard was right . And I hated his lifeless body with every ounce of my being . By coming back in time and killing himself , he forced us to become the heroes he knew we could become in his absence ... his twisted sense of what was `` the greater good '' has left countless victims in its wake . Charlie , Veronica , the thousands who died from that explosion ... the baby girl I 'll never get to meet or hold . He once told me that I had the potential to become the greatest hero the world has ever known . Who would have thought he would make that happen by travelling back in time and becoming my enemy .

The blood from his nose ran down around his mouth to where it dripped from his chin into the sand below . His formerly white t-shirt , now splattered in blood was torn in half . You could see deep visible scratches on his arms and stomach . His floral board shorts were shredded half way up his thigh . He was missing a sandal .

4,"<newline> <newline> She did n't wake me at her normal time . I 'd gotten so used to the smile in her voice dancing on my dreams over the years singing `` eight oh nine , baby boy '' everyday , that my heart started and I slammed my hand down with more force than intended on the 'off ' button as my alarm clock blared to life bringing me the morning 's weather and news with Rick Rensin and Rachel ... A storm was coming from the looks of the blue light filtering through the curtains .

Maxwell allowed himself the briefest surge of triumph . In theory , he now had all the time in the world , but he knew he could n't put this off . It would gnaw at him endlessly . And why wait ? His equations had all been triple-checked . The tests all indicated success . He had done it . He had actually done it . And now , at last , he could finally *undo* it . Finally fix the tragedy that had tormented him for the past six years . Shaking with with nervous excitement , he stepped into the booth , and activated the time machine .

Barry knew my limited swimming abilities would slow me , and my irrational fear of sharks would completely paralyze me . My fall had been no accidental bump — he was murdering me , in an obscene and cruel way . <newline> <newline> ******************************************************* <newline> <newline> `` I could n't agree more , '' I said coldly . I released the emergency brake on my wheelchair and went hurtling down the inclined deck of the sinking *Angelina* , screaming : *For Margo ! For Arthur ! * . At the very last second , Barry tried desperately to move from his precarious perch , but I had planned my attack perfectly , crashing into him and throwing us both into black water . As I slipped below , embracing my revenge , I saw him flail above me . Barry was about to learn a terrible lesson I had learned the hard way — if you look like prey , you will draw predators .

And if you 're an attacker , then how are you my big brother ? <newline> You never hurt me . Not physically . But I knew what you were doing was wrong and I feel like I should have , could have , would have stopped you . <newline> We were just kids but you ... .you should have known . You knew or else you would n't have hidden it . <newline> You 've never asked and I 've never told how much you fucked me up . Because it would kill you . <newline> When my friend at school asked if you were getting counseling for what you did because her cop dad told her she could n't hang out with me because you were bad , I threw up . I went home crying and ashamed and guilty . <newline> When I had to tell mom what you made me do and she was so destroyed by it . And I was so ashamed and so guilty . <newline> When I finally found a guy to trust and date in college and told mom and she was so excited because she thought I was broken . <newline> When that guy broke up with me because I told him my secret and he could n't understand how I could be in the same room with you . <newline> When I started cutting to try and prove to myself that I do n't feel pain . But I did and I do . <newline> <newline> I do n't hold on to what you did to me . I let it go . I learned that keeping that part of my history to myself is the only way to survive . I let the water take it . It 's washed away by the storms I 've had to weather . But I 'll never be able to share this massive part of who I am with anyone because they would see you as a monster , and I just want you to be my brother .

5,"Dear Mom , <newline> <newline> I guess here we go . It 's only a matter of time before I write you this , and only a little bit longer in the grand scheme before I join you . But here we are . <newline> <newline> Before you overdosed you said to me `` You ca n't go back to college . You fucked up . '' Less than a week later you would be dead . If you had n't died , I would not have made it back to college . I guess it 's the little things , like that , which make it difficult to accept your death . <newline> <newline> Dad 's been a wreck since you 've been gone . He lost his job . He does n't work . He does n't even move most of the time . I 'm not there to comfort him . I miss being able to talk to you two , and you 'd hand the phone off . You would n't always be happy . But the two of you would at least have some semblance of life in you . <newline> <newline> The girlfriend and I broke up . She was n't right for me . I know you thought she was , but you were wrong . Have n't dated anyone really since then . Not really . Mostly wandering . <newline> <newline> I met people . People who I thought would be my best friends who 'd quickly fade . I guess it 's difficult for me to maintain intimacy of that sort , of any sort . <newline> <newline> I 'm really scared I 'm going to turn out like you . I love you , but in the end there was no impact that you made , no friends who would help you when you were suffering . Just me . <newline> <newline> But then there are times that I think , hey . I 'm making it through college . People are talking to me . I 'm moving forward . <newline> <newline> I 'm going to make it , and when I have a child , they will make it as well .

5,"Dear Alan , <newline> <newline> Fuck you . You should n't have done that . Since the day I met you , I absolutely loved having you by my side , as a friend . My greatest friend actually , the first one I felt I could be completely honest with , and have no repercussions whatsoever . Until you got me hospitalized , by force , *against my will* , for a full two weeks . A lot happens in two weeks , it 's a really bad time to be out of school , *especially* high school , in two extremely important weeks for me , but you were never really concerned for what was in my best interests anyway . Since then I everyone of our interactions feels like I 'm lying , because when I see you I can only think of what you did , and I ca n't say how I really feel , because of the bullshit emotionless male stigma in our school . Here 's the kicker , I actually still *enjoy* hanging around you . After all the shit you made me go through after that day , your presence is enjoyable , but you wo n't even make an effort to speak to me anymore . Why the hell did you put me in a hospital to get me help if you were n't going to try and speak to me anymore ? I never wanted the help . I just wanted a friend to listen . But now I 'm here , laying in bed , emailing you , because I just ca n't stand life anymore . I 'm going to try again eventually . Now that we 're graduated , I do n't need to worry about your self-serving attitude to get in the way , because this time , no one will appreciate your help . I wo n't appreciate your help . Go to your Ivy league and stop thinking about me , not that you still do . You have a life ahead of you that I always wanted , so please live it out . <newline> <newline> I have a bottle waiting for me . <newline> <newline> <newline> Still looking up at you from below , <newline> Kevin <newline> <newline> <newline> Authors note : I feel free now . <newline> <newline> <newline> Edit : Spelling and formatting .

5,"Dear Mom , <newline> I know you 're just a room away from me , but I probably will never have the courage to tell you this . I 'm sad , mom . Everyday . I know I 'm the one that always laughs and smiles through anything , but it 's been getting pretty hard for me . It 's weird though , because there 's nothing terribly devastating going on in my life , but it 's honestly been really hard for me . Whenever I 'm alone , all I want to do is cry for hours , because I feel so , so lonely all the time , but I ca n't . I know seeing my sad makes you guilty , and I love you too much to hurt you . <newline> <newline> I 'm really sorry I disappointed you today . I did n't mean to . But mom , I do n't know what to do . I 'm really trying to listen to you , but sometimes I ca n't tell what you want from me . Sometimes you demand so much and it just makes me feel like this horrible , useless thing that you take care of only because you feel this sense of responsibility . <newline> <newline> Mom , I truly do love you . I want to give you the entire world , but I do n't know how . I know how you cry yourself to sleep at night , and I know that you feel miserable and glum all the time , and I know it 's because of me . I 'm sorry . <newline> <newline> I know you 're dating someone new . I 'm happy for you , but I wish you did n't have to keep it a secret from me . Do you know how devastated I was when I found out ? You know how supportive I am about you meeting new people , but could n't you at least tell me ? Could n't you at least tell the person who 's always been by your side through everything ? <newline> <newline> I really wished I was able to tell you this , but here I am , showing it to everyone but you . It 's ironic , is n't it ? <newline> <newline> I love you , your daughter .

I am sure of how I feel , always have , and always would have . Since you 're reading this Its certain that I have finally been able to take control and I 'm no longer with you . It was n't out of sadness or depression . It was n't because you all were n't fantastic . I enjoyed every moment of you . What 's a million sunrises without a final sunset ? Do n't be sad for me and do n't take it out on yourselves . I loved every moment even the bad parts because they gave way to better times . I waited until Tony went because that responsibility was mine to shoulder . No one else needed to carry that weight . Some of you may have noticed me acting odd lately . Going out of my way to fix things with people , pay my debts . Hand out apologies to some and offer forgiveness to others . I finished shows and stopped starting new ones . I 've run my gas tank dry and donated any funds I may have had left however meager they may have been . When you guys talk about me , do n't talk about the darkness '' in my life . Do n't discuss how I went . Share the lessons we learned together . The fun we had and the adventures we went on . Know I killed my self as an Atheist so I do n't expect anything . I went smiling because I finally had the freedom to do what I wanted and this is It . I wanted control . ALWAYS have . I hope that P outlived me .

5,"Hi grandpa . <newline> <newline> It seems kinda funny , writing to you in a reddit post . There 's so much I want to say and yet words ca n't capture it . I miss you . Your sudden death after your fall shocked me . I feel like everyone expected it , and yet I never saw it coming . I was too optimistic . I 'm so glad I visited you in hospital though -- it gives me some sense of closure at least . And I got to see you , talk to you and laugh with you the day before you fell , and the ambulances came . But there 's so much I still had to talk about , stories you needed to reretell and questions I needed and wanted to ask -- about your youth , your time in the REME and your adult life -- I only knew you for a fraction of it , and there 's so much I do n't know . <newline> <newline> Visiting Barry , your childhood city and final resting place was nice , too . But seeing your grave , your name , one of several , on one of thousands of headstones dotting the commercialised , sellout of the crematorium was sad , and humbling . I felt like that degraded you -- you were just one of the billions who passed before you . I do n't believe in an afterlife -- and it breaks my heart to think that one day , I will be old , hardly remember or care about you , and when I pass , no one will know your name , your laugh or your stories . That 'll be your so-called 'second death ' . <newline> <newline> And it frightens me , that you , me , mum dad and everyone will experience that . I 'm scared of that , and I 'm sad , because I can no longer hug you -- as you 're dressed in suspenders , a bleached white shirt and your trademark hat . You smelt like grandpa -- your house in Herne Bay was testament to that smell -- and that 's gone now too . <newline> <newline> The memories are fading . <newline> <newline> And that scares me . <newline> <newline> I love you , grandpa .

5,"Dear R , <newline> <newline> It 's crazy to think that in less than two weeks we should have been celebrating five months together . I know that 's not a lot of time , but when we were together , I celebrated every single day I was with you . <newline> <newline> When you think about it , the timing of us could n't have been much worse . It was the end of summer and we were destined to be almost half a day apart only a few weeks after we met . I had just come off the best summer of my life and you were the perfect cap to a great vacation . <newline> <newline> I still remember shutting down that ice cream joint with you the first time we hung out . I could have just sat there and talked forever . <newline> <newline> It 's funny that we always said our relationship was like a fairytale . It 's even funnier now that it does n't exist , just like the monsters and beasts in stories that parents tell their kids . What 's the moral of this tale ? Do n't love blindly if you do n't want to get blindsided . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry . That was the frustration talking . The frustration that plagued me every waking second for a month while I tried desperately to help you and help us . The frustration that came from watching our `` movie-like '' romance crash and burn while you endured hardships that I could n't help with ; hardships I would n't wish on anybody I know . <newline> <newline> Life is n't fair . You should n't have to have gone through the shit that you did . You should n't have had to be unhealthy or lose you best friend . And sometimes I feel like I should n't have had to be cut out from your life in order for you to heal . But that 's just the frustration . I really do understand why you needed us to go separate ways while you figured yourself out again . <newline> <newline> I just get frustrated because , at the end of the day , I wish you were still mine . <newline> <newline> I love you . <newline> <newline> -D

5,"Dear Sister , <newline> <newline> Our last conversation left a lot of thing unsaid . I see your points : me not reaching out to you , checking to see how you are . You call me and others selfish because , in your mind , the conversation never turns to you or what 's happening in your world . The truth is , it 's hard for me to relate to you now . <newline> <newline> I used to see you as strong , that you could overcome anything . Now all I see is you being conquered by the eating disorder . You say you are lonely , and I know that the disease makes you this way . You 've called our parents narcissists , not wanting to have anything do to with them ( especially since you do n't want them to know about your disease ) and yet have no problem asking for handouts when you 've needed money ( which they 've gladly done ) . You ca n't accept gifts from then denounce the same people who have helped you . I hate that you 've missed family events , putting money ahead of it but preach about the importance of family . I know that this but be a daily battle between your heart and mind . <newline> <newline> I do n't understand what you 're going through , I love you , and I want to help you heal . I 've seen you do extraordinary things in pursuit of your dreams . You say you do n't want to be this way anymore , but I do n't see you pursuing something that deeply affects you . I guess the reason why I do n't reach out is because maybe , if I pull away , it will hurt less when this disease finally conquers your body as it 's done your spirit . If that 's selfish of me , then it is what it is and I will have to live with that . Right now , it feels better than watching one of the great loves of my life slowly die . <newline> <newline> I do n't know where to go from here . I just know that I love you . <newline> <newline> Truly yours , <newline> Sister

5,"Dear Kyle , <newline> It 's been almost 7 years since I saw you last . Seven years from the white dress and venue down payment that I had to get returned . Seven years since I had to scramble to find an apartment in a college town in May because we split up . Seven years since you crushed my heart and made me question my self worth , my life , basically everything I 'd thought about myself and my future from high school through most of college . <newline> I am not writing you to tell you bout all that , you rwmember it as well as I do . I am writing you to thank you . Without you , I never would have realized how strong I am , the things I could do . I 've finished my masters ( two of them actually and few minors too and an early edu degree , I am working on a third ) . I learned how to fix my car and how to live on my own . But the reason I am writing you is n't because of these things . <newline> I am writing you to thank you because without you leaving I would n't know why it 's like to have a supportive partner who travels the world with me , let 's me be me , who tries new things , and loves me for being me . I 've gotten to see , do , and experience more thing than I could ever imagine . If you had n't walked out that door , I would n't be a teacher somewhere where it does n't snow . I wouldnt know my favorite wine is reisling , that I lovw Thai ( although chicken mac is still good too ) , or that Wasabi is amazing , or that the Baltimore Ravens are my favorite team . <newline> I would n't know how strong I am or all the skills I have ( crafts are a big one but teaching and cooking are good ones too ) . Most importantly , I would n't know how awesome I can be or how great a wife I can be . <newline> Thank you for leaving ... in all honesty . I wish you the best in all that you do and hope you live a long and happy life . I know I will .

I do n't know how to tell you ... Well , what needs to be said . <newline> <newline> So , let 's start with a history lesson . Remember in Freshman year , when Amy gave me her hoodie ? How I cherished it above everything else ? Sure , it was a Megatokyo hoodie , and I love Megatokyo , but there was something else there . <newline> <newline> It was a *girl's* hoodie . And I was n't outfitted with the right gender stats to equip that item . <newline> <newline> But I wore it anyways . I wore it happily . I loved it . <newline> <newline> Until you let Stepmom throw it away . `` Not a hoodie you should be wearing . Do n't wear girls clothes . '' <newline> <newline> And that was that . <newline> <newline> So I made different mistakes . I focused on the masculinity I was supposed to feel . I still read Twilight , in secret , but I also got big into Halo . Big into military stuff . Tried not to be obvious with my love of fashion . With my love of interior design . <newline> <newline> It 's not what you wanted . <newline> <newline> But , time and again , you 've put her over everyone .

5,"Hello , <newline> <newline> I will never forget you or what you have done . You took my trust and shattered it into millions of pieces , like taking a hammer to a piece of glass . I thought we were friends , but friends do n't do what you 've done . I thought that I could trust you , but I was wrong . <newline> <newline> I read all of the guides about how to avoid people like you . You know the ones . They warn women to stay with their friends . The guides advise to never leave a drink unattended at a bar and to watch when drinks are poured . Do n't become unaware of your surroundings . Constant vigilance is needed . Take RAD classes . Aim for the junk . That was worthless when it came to you . <newline> <newline> The guides never told me how to avoid you . They never told me how to recognize when a friend was actually anything but friendly . The guides never said that you would respect my bodily autonomy until that one day when you would n't . They never said that such a poisonous intention would be wrapped beautifully like the universe 's worst gag gift . <newline> <newline> The worst part of all of this is n't the lost friends , the harassment by the police or even the fact that you got off , literally and figuratively . The worst part is that I will never forget you . I will never forget the taste of you or the way that you smelled . I 'll never forget the taste of the fruit punch that you gave me or the way that I could n't taste the drug you fed me . The worst part is that I will never forget that I ca n't remember . I will never forget you or what you have done to me ... and I hate you for it . <newline> <newline> I want you to know that you have not broken me . I am just another victim to you , but what you do n't know is that I am a survivor .

5,"Dear Amira , <newline> It has been a long time since we 've talked . Well atleast while I was sober . What has it been 6 years ? That time went by so fast and I hardly remember most of it . Most of it was all bullshit anyway , just me making bad desicions over and over and refusing to get help . I 'm 25 now , not much to show for it . You 'd be 15 now . I see you sometimes , in my dreams , my nightmares , sometimes even when i 'm awake out of the corner of my eye . I even hear you , you yell at me most of the time but you do talk once in awhile . I remember back then when our unit would come to your village to talk to your chief of police . I used to give you candy for keeping the other children away from our trucks , you were the toughest iraqi kid I know . The candy was never enough you always wanted something else , every time you asked me for my watch but I could n't give it to you . I used to get in trouble for playing soccer with you and you 're brother and not keeping guard . We were on our last mission to your village before i was going to come back to the states , I tried to explain it to you but you did n't understand . Right before we left I gave you my watch , I never saw a happier kid in my life . I was smiling as I watched you show off to the other kids . I was getting back into my truck when I heard yelling and I turned to look , everything was so slow it felt like it was frozen . I watched the iraqi policeman shot you and take the watch from you and put it on . I ran over to you but you were already dead . I wanted to kill that cop but we could n't intervene in iraqi civil matters . I just had to sit there and watch your body lay on the street while we pulled away and went back to base . I have never forgave myself for that , if I had just kept the watch you would still be alive today . I 'm sure i 'll talk to tonight or tomorrow or whenever I can fall asleep next . Until then , I 'm sorry . <newline> Joe

5,"Hi Tzip , <newline> <newline> I was almost 30 when I had my first real kiss . By you . I 've been alone my whole life , too different from other people , miserly with my deepest love and affection , too much of a romantic who only dreamed of love and found it only in books and stories . It took me so long to emotionally and mentally recover from my strict and abusive childhood . Just when I began to fall into my own rhythm for the first time in my life , you came along , bubbling with laughter , beaming with your passions and aspirations . <newline> <newline> I wish you wanted to be with me despite religion . I wish the stories I told you about my childhood did n't scare you away from me . The stories of your childhood are warm and loving , filled with an gold-tinged ebullience I desperately , secretly yearn for when I make the inevitable , sad comparisons . I am broken . Despite my best efforts to put the pieces together and salvage something worthwhile from myself , I know you ca n't put the pieces together and make them truly whole again . And that 's why it hurts when I 'm faced with your rejection , even though I know a part of it has nothing to do with me . It makes so much sense that someone like you , raised in the light and warmth would turn away from someone like me , with melancholy and pain at the root of my being . You and your actions are a mirror that exposes the darkest parts of myself , the confirmation that I am unlovable by anyone I want to love , the truth that I should keep my head down , grind my teeth and try to endure my life instead of living it . <newline> <newline> No . I am trying not to think this way . The rational part of me tells me to not be silly , and that this , like all things , will get better as time progresses . I mean , the worst part of my life has been slowly healing , and this is nothing compared to it . <newline> <newline> Yet sometimes when I stand outside in the dark , staring at the stars in the sky , I feel completely alien and disconnected . Instead of feeling like part of the vast , unknowable universe , I am separate . Alone . Alone in my suffering . Alone , without you .

I miss your eyes , how they looked into me with a sense of understanding . <newline> <newline> I miss your dark sense of humor , I miss the smell and the feel of your hair . I miss when your parents would mock us and we 'd smile for it . I miss that night under the stars , where our breath shown and your eyes lit up my world as if every star had fallen directly into you , and the crashing force knocked the wind out of me , I miss how in love we seemed to be . <newline> <newline> But I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry for the way you treated me . I 'm sorry that you would leave me alone for days , then tell me I was n't reaching out enough . Tell me that I needed to hold on tighter , not to lose you , but that you were afraid of suffocation . I 'm sorry you stopped all communication , without telling me . <newline> <newline> I have a lot of wishes , I wish that I had never told Richard to come to our school . I wish I had n't let you go , that I had fought for you , I had kept on you , I had been the man you wanted me to be . I with I could have saved you from your anxiety , that you could n't trust me enough to open up , and do what I was doing . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I held back from being myself , because I did n't want to scare you away . I 'm sorry that every time I let some of myself show and you reciprocated it and understood how I was feeling , unlike anyone else , I fell back in love with you . <newline> <newline> I know I did a lot of stuff wrong , but I also know I deserve better than the way you treated me . I hope you 're happy with him , that you 've found peace with what you did to me and what you did to Katie . <newline> <newline> But fuck you . <newline> -Surfin_burd

5,"Dear Dad , <newline> <newline> I 'm pretty sure you think Mom is my hero . She stayed at home with us until high school , attended all the sports practices , school performances , made all the lunches ... and of course I love her , for all that and more , but I 'd like to tell you that you have always been my hero . <newline> <newline> Some might say that it 's just because of supply and demand ; you were in short supply growing up , so the demand was high . But that just would n't cover it . There is a connection of spirit between us that I just do n't have with Mom . <newline> <newline> Sometimes when we play cards we start to get a little competitive , and by that I mean that you become a horrendous asshole with a horseshoe so far up your ass you must taste steel ! The curse words start flying as the stakes get higher but the twinkle in your eye matches the one in mine . Meanwhile , Mom is in the other room hollering at us to `` play nice , '' never seeing that the anger is all in good fun . <newline> <newline> But I guess it really comes down to that day . You know the one . We waited for the ambulance for 45 minutes , and that whole time you did your best to breathe life back into my brother , your son . How you managed to keep it together that long , I will never know . You even drove us all to the hospital behind the ambulance . It seemed like an inhuman feat to me . Superman himself could not have kept it between the lines on that drive . <newline> <newline> It 's been a decade , and do you know what amazes me most ? That twinkle in your eye that matches mine has never disappeared . You never let your grief drown out your joy . You face each day still open to all of what life has to offer . Grief is still a constant visitor , but you set the example of how to invite it in with open arms , to acknowledge that it is part of our lives without it being a menace that must be locked out . By opening the doors easily you help to let in all the other emotions so that life is still whole . <newline> <newline> I do n't know what I would do without you . You set the example of how to live life and face its challenges with courage and humanity . <newline> <newline> Thank-you .

5,"Amber , <newline> <newline> For years I ’ ve tried to find it within myself to forgive you , I ’ ve tried so hard , but I ’ m weak and I can not . I thought what we had was real , something that transcended the conventional , but I was wrong , and even though I loathe my foolishness I ’ m glad you taught me this lesson . <newline> <newline> You ’ ve broken me , and I fear that I ’ ll never be able to get over my own insecurities and self-doubt . It makes me wonder when I think about it if you ever had feelings for me , at least the way you claimed . <newline> <newline> You asked me something the night I left when you told me the truth . The truth that in some way I always knew but chose to ignore , maybe I was just hopeful or maybe I was just naïve , or maybe I knew that if I confronted it that I would lose you . You asked me when was the moment I realized I loved you , and then you asked if I could feel that moment after your confession . <newline> <newline> I never answered you and I think we both knew the answer as to why . I knew it was going to be bad , but you surprised me . I don ’ t know why , but it has bothered me ever since that night . Maybe if I had voiced it then things may have been different for us , or maybe I ’ m still just as gullible as I was back then . Maybe I just feel like a question like that shouldn ’ t have gone unanswered on my part . <newline> <newline> Do you remember the night I came home early and I told you to put on jeans and grab a jacket ? It must have been just after New Year ’ s now that I think about it . You kept asking what was going on and I never said anything . It took us about 40 minutes to get to where we were going , and the whole time you kept asking what we were doing and I would just smile and tell you to wait . I parked us in the middle of the field and we lied on the hood of my car and watched the stars fall from the sky . <newline> <newline> In the rush you must ’ ve forgotten your jacket and as we watched the sky you asked for mine . That was the moment , that ’ s when you had me . <newline> <newline> Michael

5,"Dear E , <newline> <newline> I saw a picture of us the other day from the time we reconnected as more than friends . I wanted to get in touch with you , but you 've deleted your Facebook and changed your email address . I tried looking for you online but I do n't even know if you 're still working where you were before . It 's been several years ; maybe you 've left Austria . <newline> <newline> My mind runs to memories , lapping at them like a puppy . It was only a conversation or two after that night that we realized that we 'd been attracted to each other for years . I still have trouble believing it . You always seemed to have this way about you , with your fierce intelligence and strong sense of self . Me ? I was always his little sister , and felt like I lived in the shadow of that title . I 'm glad you saw me as more . <newline> I have this one image of you from when we were kids , leaning over your guitar and tuning it to Blackbird . You were -and still are , I 'm sure- so magnetic . You were so proud of the culture we shared . I loved that about you , and your incredible memory for history . Thinking about it now , that could 've subconsciously pulled me to study it in college . If that 's the case , I 'd like to thank you for that too . You picked up so many things so rapidly and it made me want to achieve more for myself as well . <newline> <newline> I wish that we 'd been able to run off for a weekend like we 'd talked about after reconnecting . <newline> Still , I 'm glad we had that one time together . It meant so much to me ... And feeling the culmination of the years was beyond anything I 'd experienced . Despite it being only an hour or two that we could share , those moments have been imprinted in my memory since . Thank you . I know it was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us . I hope you know that those brief hours are still cherished . <newline> <newline> I wish I could talk to you . Not knowing what 's going on in your life makes me imagine all the things you could be doing these days . Having no idea how to reach you , I 'm left to wonder . I hope whatever you 're working on is making you happy . Your eyes are even more beautiful when you 're smiling . <newline> <newline> Fondly ,

5,"Dear Natalie . <newline> <newline> So here I am . Funny how things work , right ? Never thought I 'd end up penning this letter , but I guess something prompted me to do it . <newline> <newline> I know . I 've known ever since it happened what your real motivations were , and you never had me fooled for a second . After you apologized , and said that you were just messing around and did n't mean anything by what do guys did , I knew that was bullshit . I looked you right in the eyes and I did n't want to look away , I saw exactly what you were thinking , because I was thinking it too . <newline> <newline> <newline> Do n't treat me like I 'm naive , I never was even in my deepest innocence . I have n't forgiven you and I do n't think I ever will , I trusted you . I did n't know Dave , but I fucking trusted you . I love you to pieces , but you betrayed me in a way no one ever has , and now no one ever can again . <newline> <newline> <newline> You know what it felt like , lying on that couch , feeling an empty void in my stomach sucking away everything . I felt unclean , I felt violated . <newline> <newline> <newline> I was violated . <newline> <newline> <newline> You did it . You both did it . I 've never felt so emasculated , so small . I tower over both of you , I exercise , I work out , I play rugby . I try to embody the ideal man , but I did n't do anything , I was locked in my own body , bound with shock . I felt worthless afterwards . <newline> <newline> <newline> Some sickening part of me hopes that you two stay together , despite the shit he 's done to you , and despite the pain you 've caused me , and despite how much I care for you . I want you to explain to your kids that the day mommy and daddy got together they did something dark and terrible . I want to be your fucking family secret . <newline> <newline> <newline> Because then I 'll have something . Anything . Other than a story to share with strangers while I talk away my problems . Other than that thing that was `` oh so me '' . Something to go with the whole `` hopeless romantic '' thing I have going . Something to hold on to at night . <newline> <newline> <newline> With all the love that I can muster and more , your friend , Redrum .

5,"Nancy , <newline> <newline> We knew each other since we were five years old , and we 've hated each other all the way through . I do n't think about you much anymore , but from what I hear from other people you 're still a violent , stupid , aggressive thug . If you were writing this , I guess you 'd say that you hear that I 'm still not very nice . <newline> <newline> You hit me and scratched me until I bled ; I found everything that you hated about yourself and leveraged that until you bled too . I 've always been good at finding when people are sad/angry/lonely/insecure/all tied up inside about , and I used that against you in the worst way possible . Some people would say that you started it , because you hit me , but you were trapped with me as much as I was trapped with you and fifteen years later I 'm guessing that you are n't ashamed of yourself for it . <newline> <newline> I am . <newline> <newline> You tried to kill yourself when we were both twelve . They 'd stopped shoving us together by then , but that does n't mean that the things that I said did n't have some influence . Probably not a lot . Some of that blame falls on your parents . A lot of that blame falls on you . And yeah , some of that 's on me too . <newline> <newline> I 've grown up since then , and I 've tried to do better . I still have that uncanny nose for dysfunction and I 've tried to use it for good . I could list for you people -- people abusive mothers and fathers and boyfriends or whose heads are just so knotted up and dark that I found . And when I found them , I did whatever I could to help . I have spent so much time and energy trying to make up for what I did n't do . I could list a whole lot of people who I 've helped , who I 've talked down from suicide or self-harm or just listened to until the inside of their head lay quiet and smooth like an untangled skein of thread , but that sounds hollow . <newline> <newline> I guess what I 'm trying to say is that I should have been better . I 'm sorry , and I 'm trying to do better , even if I know that you 'll never see it . That 's not entirely because of you- not by a long shot- but some of it is . <newline> <newline> I wanted you to know . <newline> <newline> Yours , <newline> Caroline <newline>

5,"Full disclosure , I wrote a version of this years ago when it was applicable , but have revised it slightly here . <newline> <newline> Dear ( unnamed ) Cereal Company , <newline> <newline> I once purchased a box of your well-known breakfast cereal - the reasons why do not matter , but it is relevant that this was an `` in-date '' purchase . I recall enjoying your cereal as a small child due to its sugar content and brightly colored packaging , however , I now regret ingesting it . <newline> <newline> For several years , I have been a dog owner . During this time , much as I imagine new parents do , I watched my pups grow and change . One thing that has not changed , is their eating habits . Indeed , though I feel I must disclose that I have never deliberately fed them any of the following items , in addition to their regular meals of nutritionally complete food my dogs have voluntarily and enthusiastically consumed all of the following : <newline> - squeaky toys <newline> - the squeakers inside the squeaky toys <newline> - alcoholic beverages <newline> - plastic wrap <newline> - styrofoam <newline> - cardboard <newline> - candles <newline> - fruits & vegetables , seeds , rinds , and trimmings ( including one memorable day with a raw artichoke ) <newline> - shoes <newline> - coffee and tea ( occasionally including the filter paper ) <newline> - dead birds <newline> - dead snakes <newline> - live snakes <newline> - an Easter egg dyeing kit <newline> - flour <newline> - moldy yogurt <newline> - spoiled milk <newline> - scat ( especially the feline variety ) <newline> - rocks <newline> <newline> The list goes on , but I feel I have listed enough for you to get the general gist of their digestive habits . <newline> <newline> My dogs managed to get a hold of this newly purchased and unopened box of supposedly nutritionally sound cereal ( I suspect they bribed a cat ) that was , in theory , chock full of vitamins and made from whole grain ( in addition to all the sugar ) . They tore the packaging open ... and *did not eat any cereal . * Not a bite , a nibble , nor even a lick of freeze dried marshmallow . They did , however , eat the box . <newline> <newline> Seeing as how they always believed themselves to be on the brink of starvation , despite visible evidence to the contrary , I can find no rational basis for their rejection of the cereal except that in the very small part of their doggy brains devoted to deciding what foods should be eaten ... your cereal ranks somewhere far below cat shit and rocks . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> <newline> McDangertail

5,"It 's December 11th today . All day today , as it 's been most days , my thoughts have been of you , and how I 've hurt the one person who 's loved me unconditionally , the mother of my beloved son , and the person I promised the rest of my life to . It would have been 10 years today . <newline> <newline> I broke that promise . I regret it every single day . <newline> <newline> Falling for you was easy . You 're perfect . Finding myself was not . Is not . And it 's not your fault , Lord knows I 've blamed everybody else , but I ca n't ever blame you . I still do n't know where I am or where I 'm headed . I know is it 's led me to the temptation that resulted in this . I do know that I am working towards a way I can be of some use to you , to ease your burden and be a good father to our son . I 'm not breaking this promise , babe . I repeat it to myself every morning . Hang in there , please . <newline> <newline> I was blind , and could n't see how great I had it . My heart hurt from my failures and I felt like I might taint you and Nathan with them if I could n't somehow fix it . <newline> <newline> I was selfish , and thought only of myself when I decided to entertain thoughts that should never have entered my mind . I insulted you , your whole family , and US . I do n't deserve the civility you still show me . <newline> <newline> Please know that I love you with all my heart . You are an angel I didnt deserve . Please know that I do n't stop trying to ease your burden , and I do n't stop planning to be back for our son . One day it wo n't be a plan anymore . I 'm so close . Sometimes all I want to do is share it with you , my best friend . <newline> <newline> I do n't know how to thank you for all you 've done , so I 've just been rambling on . You 're in my thoughts and my heart today , and always . <newline> <newline> He is amazing , and it 's because of you . <newline>

Nine and a half years . <newline> <newline> It has been 9 years since I was wrong about us . Nine years since I received a call that you were in the hospital , your heart had stopped . Nine years ago you survived another overdose , this time you decided to stay in your hometown . Nine years since you mailed back the ring , with a tear-stained letter , and empty apologies . Nine Years . <newline> <newline> It has been 5 years since I received your email , a cry for help , addressed to the only person that understood you , someone you still love . Five years since I tried to reach out to you , unsuccessfully . Five years since you did not survive your third overdose . <newline> <newline> It has been three days since I thought about you .

5,"Dear Ryan , <newline> <newline> How are you doing ? What 's college like for you ? I still remember how passionate you were about going into business . Most of all , are you happy ? The short time that we spent together were some of the best and worst years of my life . <newline> <newline> I do n't think I 'll ever understand why you had done it . Was it for a sense of accomplishment ? I was left angry and disappointed , but most of all I was hurt from the betrayal . You apologized profusely when I found out , your eyes shimmering with tears but they were no match for the ones I shed . We fought so much to days leading up that point ; we had never fought before . I did n't expect any of it . I felt humiliated by you and them , who were supposed to be my best friends . <newline> <newline> During that one movie night at your house , you told me you loved me . Did you ever mean it ? It 's scary having these feelings at this age . I told you I loved you a couple days later . From that day on , we told each other those three words almost as much as we breathed . Regardless of everything that went down , this was a lesson I had to learn eventually . I 've come to terms with it , and I 've moved on . I hope you take care of yourself , and if we ever meet again down the road , I hope you and I can look each other in the eye and not have that sense of regret between us . <newline> <newline> Take care .

It has been a long time since you molested me and those 3 other kids , and I hope you are rotting in that cell . <newline> <newline> Ever since what you have done , I have battled severe depression and extreme psychosis . Do you know what its like being a 10 year old boy huddled in a corner thinking the shadows are going to get him while the voices in his head scream at him in unintelligible words ? Do you know what it 's like for a 12 year old to contemplate suicide just to get the voices to stop .

5,"Dear Baybuh , <newline> <newline> I never knew how quickly I could go from loving someone to instantly hating them . I had so much love for you , and you did n't care in the slightest . I see now I was more of a prisoner than a girlfriend for those four years , but I still loved you . <newline> <newline> I still loved you after you raped me . You even had me convinced that I was lucky that you loved me so much because after that , no man would want me . I still loved you after you bashed my head into a cupboard , convinced it was my fault because I should n't push your buttons like that . <newline> <newline> Even after we had broken up the first time , because you left me for the night to spend the night with Allison , I still loved you . You told me you were to hungover to deal with me , and I still loved you . Even after you were using me for sex , promising me we 'd get back together , I still loved you . <newline> <newline> I even still loved you when I slept with Josh while we were dating . The entire time I was thinking about it should be us . He was so sweet and tender , and did n't force me into anything . I cheated on you , and this is still my biggest regret in my entire life . I still have days where I feel like the scum of the earth for doing to you what you did to me . This does n't make it right , cheating on someone is one of the worst things to do , and I will forever regret that . <newline> <newline> Then I met adam . He is so sweet , and so patient with me . I forgot what love should be after you . He 's the most amazing man I 've ever met , and even knows I cheated and still accepts me . He makes me feel loved and wanted , something I realize now you never gave me . Do you know how amazing it is to know that no matter want you say or do , the one you love the most will always be right by your side ? Not dragging you , or you leaving them behind , but by your side . <newline> <newline> So I want to thank you . Thank you for showing what love is n't . Thank you for scarring me the way you did . Now I have this amazing love in my life and I can appreciate him more and more each day . Thank you . <newline> <newline> And also Fuck you nathan . <newline> <newline> Sincerely Kristin .

I read before we met you that Shar-Pei dogs were aloof , intelligent , and very independent . You were not a stupid dog , not in the least . I miss hearing you walk up the stairs , gunting , sniffing at the floor like a vacuum cleaner , looking up at me as if to say `` What the hell are you doing ?

And when it was n't , you did your thing , which was mostly sleeping , but we respected that ( sometimes . ) I do still remember those times I would wake you up to scratch under your chin . Your skin folds are still fondly hilarious to me , your `` chops '' and your `` whisker pads . '' You had such a soft face , I miss petting it .

5,"Hi , we have n't talked in a while . <newline> <newline> I heard you bought a house and got a dog of your own . You have this nice job that pays very well and you are moving up and making a lot of connections . <newline> I 'm sorry , I 'm avoiding the subject . <newline> <newline> I was dumb . It is entirely my fault that we broke up and I 'm very sorry I put you through it . <newline> <newline> I hope you understand that you did n't do anything wrong and that you deserve better than me . I was not good enough for you back then and I 'm not much better now . During the short 6 months we dated I came to realise I did n't connect with you emotionally . If you where sad or worried I did n't empathise with those emotions . I kinda reacted how I should react and not how I felt . Young and dumb is what that was . I should just been more honest and this could 've been avoided for you . <newline> <newline> When you where crying on the couch that morning I finally realised that I did n't feel for you . I realised at that point we would n't work out . I would care less and less about you , all the while reaping all the benefits of the relationship . <newline> <newline> You deserve better . <newline> <newline> There 's so much I want to say or apologize for but it 's all excuses and I do n't want to patronize you with them because I ca n't let go of the most amazing girl I ever dated <newline> <newline> Just be happy ... please be happy . It 's been years but I have n't heard anyone say that about you yet .

5,"Dear Mariana , this may not be your number anymore but I do n't care I had to get this out . When you and I started are little `` relationship '' I guess you could call it that , it was really pretty small in hindsight but that does n't matter . What does is that when we were talking I was in the biggest and most challenging part of my life . Not with you but with personal things , literally everything had changed and I honestly think that you helped me deal with it better then anything else ever could . But I 'll be honest when you said we should breakup , I was scared because I thought we were n't going to talk anymore and that 's what I needed then . I 'm not trying to make you feel guilty or anything it 's just that without talking to you I actually did get a little crazy and I have n't ever changed back . Now I 'm stressed out or numb , I have n't really loved anything in a while , but I used to love my music and you and meeting new people and having relationships . But now it 's become just me trying to reach for something perfect , but that I know wo n't happen . I do n't know why I changed like that and frankly its something I do n't like to think about . It used to be different but it changed and I want to be back the same way , I 'll see you this summer and I hope that 'll you see me and ask me . <newline> This was the love of my life and my best friend . I 've seen her a couple times since then but it 's never been enough for us to be close again

5,"Hi , 17 year old me . <newline> <newline> I 'm still you , only almost 10 years older . <newline> <newline> It 's weird to think that I 'm writing this in a small place that I share with my ( our ? ) significant other when only 10 long ( short ? ) years ago , we were struggling with Algebra II .

The veil was removed from our eyes , the sun came out . You got stronger , but you were still so brittle inside . <newline> <newline> I 'm here to tell you that it got better .

We have a few select friends , you work a decent job making a decent wage . <newline> <newline> I know we 're struggling right now , I know the veil is pulling over our face .

We rarely talk now but if I can say anything I wanted to here it is - <newline> <newline> I would just tell you again that you meant a lot to me . <newline> <newline> You 've taught me so much over the years . You taught me to live with so much more love and compassion than I ever have before . That means so much to me . <newline> <newline> I know a sorry does n't fix things but I tell you every day you just do n't know it . I guess friends come and go in life but after having you as a friend it 's so hard to let you go . <newline> <newline> We had a LOT of good and hilarious times together though and I 'll cherish those memories forever . I could go on and on about the funniest things that happened to us . Or the fact that we could literally just stay home and do nothing and it was just as fun as if we went out and had some crazy adventure . <newline> <newline> I guess what I miss most is having that person I can go to and talk about whatever . <newline> <newline> Well , as much as it sucks to lose your best friend especially how I made those dumb choices that costed our friendship I am so glad to have met you . And I 'll never forget that big gooby smile of yours . <newline> <newline> I hope all is well , <newline> <newline> Old friend

5,"Dear Violet <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I did n't tell you how I felt about you . I was always nervous when it came to girls , you of all people should remember that . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I did n't hang out with you more . I always thought I would have time later , but I never made time for it . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I did n't dance with you at prom . I know I promised you that I would , but you looked like you were having fun with your new boyfriend and I did n't want to ruin it . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry was n't there when you needed help moving out . It all happened so fast with you and Mike breaking up and getting back together again so much , I did n't think it would stick that time . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry that I did n't get to say goodbye when you left . I did n't think you 'd leave without telling me . <newline> <newline> For as long as I have know you , you 've always been the friend that awkward , nerdy kid needed . I probably would n't be here if it were n't for you . I mean it . I was n't in a good place before I met you.It may not have been under the best circumstances that we became friends , but I would n't have had it any other way . <newline> <newline> I do n't know if you 'll feel the same way , or if this is the right time to say it and I have no idea how else to say this so I 'll just say it . <newline> <newline> Violet Brindley <newline> <newline> I love you . <newline> <newline> Yours Truly <newline> Tim <newline> <newline>

5,"Dear Dad , <newline> <newline> I miss you more than words can say . Not a day goes by that I do n't feel your absence . I wish that you 'd been here when I needed a friend and a guide . I wish that I 'd been there for you more , smiled more , hugged you every day , and told you how much you meant to me . I wish that I 'd had the forethought and the courage to tell you what a great dad you were when you were still alive or aware enough to understand . I had plenty of opportunities and wasted them all . You were the best father I could have ever hoped for , I did n't deserve you . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry for being the ungrateful little snob I was when I was younger . Your patience and love helped me grow from that person into who I am today , I walk in your immeasurable shadow . I have a girlfriend , a career , and I 'm your grandson 's favorite uncle . You deserved more time with him than you had . <newline> <newline> I wish you knew how lucky I felt to have a you as my father . I feel ashamed of the times I did n't appreciate you . There are times like today , where shame and moments of intense sadness grip me and I ca n't stop the tears . <newline> <newline> Since your absence every unanswered e-mail , ignored link , or under-appreciated gift haunts me . I wonder if you thought your son was ashamed of you , I was n't . With all your faults , I was proud of you , I wish I had told you so . I 'm not half the man you were . <newline> <newline> I promise to keep trying . <newline> <newline> -J

5,"Dear R , <newline> <newline> I have started and stopped this letter numerous times over the past couple of years , because the thought of writing to you makes me feel ridiculous . <newline> <newline> I wonder if you would even remember me ? You were gone before I arrived in your little world , and strange as it seems , I miss you without ever having spoken to you . <newline> <newline> In college , I fell in love with one of your friends . I 'm not a romantic person , so it makes me slightly squeamish to even write out the words 'fell in love ' . We talk about falling in love like it 's one big accident , but it was n't for me . I deliberately began to love him because I loved his warm little world - your world . Your friends , and your life , and the way you guys were nonchalantly such a charming , diverse and happy group of humans . <newline> <newline> I know you must know this , but you were very very loved . This question comes up sometimes , about whether there was anything anyone could have done for you , if they had loved you more , would you have made a different choice ? <newline> <newline> I run the half marathon for suicide awareness each year for you . I do n't tell any of them , because I would feel slightly awkward explaining why I have this urgent attachment to you . It 's because you 've impacted my life , in your abrupt death . <newline> <newline> It 's because I wish I had known you sooner , so I could have learned to love you through your presence and not your absence . It 's a feeling I never want to have with anyone else . <newline> <newline> You are still so loved and missed . <newline> <newline> -A <newline>

5,"[ REDACTED ] , <newline> <newline> My love . When I met you , I swore I would never say goodbye , but I suppose I will have to eventually . I want you to be happy and it breaks my heart to know that I ca n't bring you the happiness you deserve . It hurts so much to know that our time together will eventually end . I hope some day you can know how deeply I love you : when I let myself feel all of my feelings towards you my heart feels like it might burn through my chest . My love like it might burn through my skin . <newline> <newline> I 'm glad you found [ REDACTED ] , I did n't know you could be as happy as she has made you . Letting you go is the hardest thing I 'll ever do , but I am consoled by the fact that you are in her care . She is the only person I 've met amazing enough to deserve you . You are the most wonderful human being I have ever encountered and I want you to have the best of everything . <newline> <newline> I sometimes lament the lot I have been cast , but I 'd rather suffer in silence as your friend then not know you at all . If I could be your lover , I would do it in a heartbeat . I 'd bring you the world on a silver platter ; even as your friend I will do anything you ask of me . If I can , I would like to help you make your dreams come true . <newline> <newline> If I have ever hurt you , I apologize . If I have ever made you sad , I 'm sorry . Whatever I might have done , I did n't mean it . I 'm even sorry I wrote this letter , though I meant every word of it . I do n't want to ruin what we have ; it may not be what I want , but I 'll take what I can get . You will always be worth it . <newline> <newline> Your friend , <newline> <newline> /u/throwaway3893d

5,"My Dear , <newline> <newline> It is interesting how our perception of time seems inverse to our age . When we were young time was fleeting and yet there was always enough of it with you . Now we get older , accumulating the years like rings in a tree . The present is long , slow and arduous yet there never seems to be enough of it . <newline> <newline> I always cherished our time together but not so much as I should have because I truly never expected it to end . I trusted myself back then , I believed- knew , I could do anything I wanted and it would succeed . I had you . I loved you and even when it became clear that we could no longer be together , I loved you all the more . <newline> <newline> I knew it was my fault all along , the self-destructive life I had built around me was clearly pushing you away even though we both tried to help each other through . I was honestly too depressed to pull out of it , and I still am . After my brothers death and then losing you , I stopped caring . Nothing hurts more than knowing my own inadequacy and lack of effort is what led to our separation especially when you were the only good thing left . <newline> <newline> This is all I really wanted to say . I 'm too much of a scared child to actually let you know how I feel . I know I will never be a good enough person to be worth your time and that to tell you these things would be a selfish thing to burden you with . I just had to say somewhere , somehow that I still love you , that I always will , that I ca n't not even if I wanted . <newline> <newline> Take care , <newline> <newline> Love

5,"Dear Michael ; <newline> <newline> I do not even know where to start . <newline> <newline> I am sorry . I am sorry it took me to long to love you . I 'm sorry I toyed with your emotions like a bored house cat toying with a mouse . I am sorry I abandoned you when you needed me most ; that I was too engulfed in drowning my troubles in substances to see how badly you were hurting . <newline> <newline> Maybe I just blamed you being on the road the majority of the time . I thought I was strong enough for long distance , but I eventually caved in to my boredom . I acted like we were worlds apart when in reality it was a simple three hour car ride to see someone who I would kill to see right now . And I guess that 's what makes me feel the worst , I could not stay sober for a measly three hours to go see you and be reminded that all could be right in the world . <newline> <newline> I am so worried about you Michael . I worry about you all the time . I hope your attempt on you life was the only one you try in your lifetime . If I found you to succeed in a future attempt I would lose the one ray of sunshine I have . Even if you continue to ignore me and never speak to me again , nothing would make me happier than seeing you find someone who loves you and you two to grow old together . It sounds crazy , but someoneone loving you as much as I love you is the one keeping me here . Even if it is not me . <newline> <newline> I love you Michael . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> Sorry <newline> <newline> Ps-after I saw you a few months ago I cried the whole way home . <newline> <newline>

5,"To the person ( or family ) who had my dog before me : <newline> <newline> I suppose to you he must still be your lost dog since I found him unclaimed in a shelter , and I 'm sorry for your sake that you did n't find him again but I 'm glad for mine that I did . <newline> <newline> I can tell he must have had a great home with you . He does n't jump on the furniture ( unless no one 's looking ) or let himself through cracked-open doors without invitation . He 'll sit for his leash and dinner and he 's incredibly careful with the cats . I picked an older dog at the shelter because I did n't want to deal with puppy energy , and you , who did , raised him into a fantastic dog . <newline> <newline> You were probably better for him than me , objectively . I do n't spend all that much time training with him like you must have . But he 's warm , safe , and almost never alone even though he 's not with you anymore . He gets brushed and played with and walked and sleeps beside me in bed . <newline> <newline> He 's the first dog I 've ever had , and if he were any less sweet I probably would have given up in the middle of learning just what daily life with a dog is . I did make it with him , though , and now I never want to let him go . I 'll give him the best home I can for as long as I have him and I 'll probably look for another dog someday after he 's gone . <newline> <newline> So I 'm sorry you lost your dog , but he 's okay . He 's happy . And he 's made me happy . I 'm sorry you lost your dog , but I 'm glad I got to find him . <newline>

I do n't think I could top how much love and genuine affection you 've shown them when you were here . I do n't know how to say some of the things I 've been holding onto or even what to say .

I know how watching everyone act the way they did must have broken your heart but we both know they 're all good people . They just do n't know how to act sometimes ahaha , old country aye ? Your brothers miss you and , as much as you two argued , so does your sister . Your mom and dad are well , they 're still batshit crazy ahaha and so are the rest of the oldies . <newline> <newline> To be honest though , I 'm still coping . <newline> <newline> I was always taking care of all of us when we were younger , *sigh* remember the fights I would get into because of you brats ? Those really were good times ... Anyways , I 'm gon na go now . I 've written this with nowhere to send it . <newline> <newline> Miss you forever , J.I

5,"Amélie , mon amour , <newline> <newline> Nous ne nous parlons plus . ça fait déjà longtemps ... Tu sais , je penses toujours à toi , de temps en temps ... souvent même . C'est dur d'oublier les moments qu'on a passé ensemble . Quand on s'est rencontré je me suis senti le plus chanceux du monde , je t'ai vu comme la fille exceptionnelle que tu es et j'ai succombé rapidement . Toi ? non . Et là était tout le problème , un problème que je n'ai jamais vu , l'amour rend aveugle , non ? <newline> <newline> Je ne sais toujours pas pourquoi ni comment on a pu rester ensemble si longtemps , et pourtant je suis loin d'être stupide . Tu ne m'as jamais aimé et pourtant tu m'as laissé m'accrocher à toi comme une huitre à son rocher , faute de meilleur image , et ce fut à grands coups de marteau que tu as du m'en décrocher . <newline> <newline> Tu m'as brisé , ça y est c'est dit , et là , seul devant mon écran je me met à pleurer . Et le pire c'est que même après ça j'ai toujours ces sentiments forts , ceux dont mon vocabulaire , pourtant fournis , ne peut pas transmettre la profondeur . Oui , tu m'as dit que c'était pas de ma faute , c'est pas ce que j'ai fait , et ça aussi tu l'as dit ; c'est ce que je suis . Je ne suis pas quelqu'un que TU peux aimer . Toi et surement d'autres . <newline> <newline> Je n'ai plus confiance dans le genre féminin . On dit que les femmes aiment par les sentiments mais c'est pas le cas . Je regarde autours de moi et je vois bien que les histoires d'amour comme je les rêve n'existent pas pour ma génération ... . Je voulais vraiment vivre quelque chose avec toi . tu m'as brisé , je te déteste énormément , et je t'aime encore plus . <newline> <newline> <newline> Reviens , <newline> Moi du passé .

5,"Dear S , <newline> <newline> It still hurts a lot . You made it clear to me then that you were over our relationship , but I still ca n't bring myself to come to terms with it . Sure , with time , the feelings are numbed and I try my best to suppress it . <newline> It hurts a lot to know that you 've moved on while I 'm still in grief here . But every time I remember the things we did together , my emotions flow back and I feel completely overwhelmed . You were the first girl I loved truly with all my heart , and it was my first serious relationship . It may been only 8 months but those 8 months with you were the best I ever shared with anyone . Looking back , I know now that I was naive and did n't notice or understand the things that were important to you like the way you felt when I took very long to reply to texts . Our exams got in the way and stuff and you decided that it was n't meant to be . <newline> <newline> But for me , I will always love you . You will always hold a special place in my heart . I will never forget the feeling of your hands in mine , the feeling of you lying on my shoulder and the feeling of your lips on mine . Now they 're all pleasant memories that I 'll look back upon and a painful lesson to me . <newline> <newline> I 'm going into the army ( mandatory conscription ) next year and you 'll be continuing your studies ahead of me . I hope you 'll find that something in life you told me you were looking for . I 'm sorry and I love you . <newline> <newline> Ps . I still keep that photo of you and I in my wallet , I ca n't bring myself to put it away even though my buddies said otherwise .

Not that I pine after you . And not just because of the sex . Not just because I love you , and will likely always love you in a way . I miss you because you are my friend . <newline> <newline> You radiate happiness . You are a pleasure to just listen to . You are ... FUN . You are just so damn fun .

I 'm in the car right now , I 'm doing 90 , on the freeway . Hey Slim , I just drank a fifth of vodka , dare me to drive ? You know that one song by Phil Collins called `` In the Air Tonight '' ? About that guy who could 've saved that other guy from drowning , but did n't , and Phil saw at all , and had to show he found him ? That 's kinda how this is ; you could 've rescued me from drowning . Now it 's too late , and I 'm on 1000 downers , now I 'm drowsy . And all I wanted was a lousy letter or call . I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall . I loved you Slim - we could 've been together , think about it . You 've ruined it now ; I hope you ca n't sleep , and you dream about it . And when you dream I hope you ca n't sleep and you scream about it . I hope your conscience eats at you and you ca n't breathe without me . Hey - *shut up bitch , I 'm tryna talk* - hey Slim , that 's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk .

Again and again you told me you cared for me , you loved me , you wanted to be with me , and every time I was too scared to go through with it . I 'm sorry my actions did not reflect how I felt . I remember meeting you for the first time In high school , in our English class . You would laugh at my dumb jokes and told some pretty bad ones yourself . I remember people teasing us that we liked each other , and we would deny it , not because we did n't , but because whenever you would tell me you wanted me , I would say no because I knew I did n't deserve you . I was so selfish to think that , because by saying no to the only girl I ever loved , I was also denying you what you wanted . I 'm sorry we stopped talking after we moved away from each other , and nothing pains me more than the day you moved back , I can to pick you up from the airport and I saw that wedding ring on your finger . Now we do n't even talk to each other , because even being near to one another brings back to us the painful memories of what could have been . You ca n't leave him because he 's been everything to you when I was not . It tears my heart apart knowing that we love each other but can never be . <newline> <newline> i know it 's too late to change things , but I 'm sorry for my weakness Marisa .

5,"Frankie , <newline> <newline> Once , you told me that one of the moments that sticks out in your mind is driving in the car with me . I remember that , too ; just the two of us , somewhere on Route 64 , headed back from Taos . I can still close my eyes and be right there in the passenger seat ; I can see our intertwined fingers and the white paracord bracelet hanging from your wrist , lit up occasionally by the headlights of a passing car . It 's the same paracord bracelet Gene made for us at Philips Junction , the morning after we woke up on the cabin roof , covered in dew . It 's the same paracord bracelet I noticed you wearing in your pictures for years after we last saw each other . <newline> <newline> I still have that damn bracelet , somehow . Incidentally , I came across it the other day . I picked it up and ran it through my fingers , and instantly it brought me right back to being in the car with you . I always held on to the idea that we 'd run into each other *somehow* ... no matter how improbable it was . But it has been years now , and we 've never even been in the same state . <newline> <newline> I really , truly was head over heels in love with you , and I was in love with you in a way that I do n't think I could ever be again . I think I had such a hard time letting go because there was never a definite goodbye ; we kissed each other one last time and promised to see each other again next summer , but you never came back . For years , it broke my heart every time I heard a banjo , because all I could hear was you picking away on the porch swing . But finally , I 'm at a point where I do n't think about you all the time . Finally , I 'm at a point where I can stick by bare hand into the cold ashes and really feel that it 's over . <newline> <newline> And the thing about ashes is that you can use them as fertilizer . <newline> <newline> You taught me so much about love - *real love* , without jealousy or petty games . I think the version of me from that summer will always be in love with that version of you , but the truth is , neither of us are those people anymore .

5,"Dear soandso , <newline> <newline> I remember when we first met . Around five years ago now . How time flies . We were younger then , and I was so naïve to the suffering you had gone through at such a young and formative age . <newline> <newline> I remember us singing in the choir , me helping you out when you could n't hit the notes right . Even though you were n't the best singer , it was still beautiful to my ears , it always will be . You were dating someone far older than you were , and I will never understand why . Were you insecure ? Were you afraid ? You were doing things that a person your age should n't have had any business doing . I always detested the group of people you would be with : They had and still do n't have a direction , and unfortunately , it rubbed off on you . <newline> <newline> I graduated high school on time , you a little later . But on my graduation day , you told me your intentions with me . I always knew that you and I would be together , everyone did . Little did I know that life would not be easy . Love was n't easy . Learning to love you despite your flaws was hard . <newline> <newline> I craved to be outside and experience the world around us , but you never did . You feared the outside . You feared leaving the hole , physically , emotionally and mentally . I had hope that love and time would help , but it made it worse . You played more PC Games , you met some people online . I hate these people . They took you away from me . You fell for all of them , regardless of their emotional abuse and empty suicidal threats . You believed them over me . You threw away five years and friendship and love , regardless of all that I did . Christmas would 've been 2.5 years , and I had intended to give myself more to you . To start my life with you . But your intentions were different . I do n't know how you 're doing , and vice versa . Maybe it 's better that way , that way you wo n't feel the guilt and pain I have been . But it 's alright , I 'll be okay , at least I do n't live with the paranoia they put me through . I 'm meeting people and I 'm going to the north soon , like you always wanted to . Maybe you were n't singing the wrong notes ; maybe you had n't found the right harmony . I hope you understand one day . Is brea liom tu . <newline> <newline> PowerFalcons

5,"Dear You , <newline> <newline> I do n't know if you 're there . If you exist anywhere in this world . Maybe you 'll always be a concept in my mind of the kind of person I need to meet and say all of this to . If you 're not there , then that 's depressing . But if , somewhere , you exist ... <newline> <newline> I have n't been strong . I 've been plagued with weakness in almost every aspect of my life , self-conceived or not . I ca n't possibly understand the kind of back road I 've set myself on in spite of all of the advantages I 've been handed , and lesser still do I understand how someone like me can be in this position . <newline> <newline> It 's such a fatal fault that I ca n't help but scream sometimes . The idea that I must not scream . All of these faults , all of these emotions , I have to keep aside to maintain the persistent illusion that I am fine , when it is not so . The environment I am in is fine , therefore I must also be ; is n't that the way it works ? I suppose some people could call this a form of depression , but it 's nothing of the sort . I do not have the privilege of attributing how I feel to a concrete cause and symptom . It is my responsibility to not scream . <newline> <newline> How many people have turned away from me when I have ? When , in a sudden surge of desperation and crippled fortitude , I have poured onto them all of my worries , all of my thoughts , emotions , curses , and faults ; when I have exposed every facet of my very being to them to see , because I want to be seen ? How many have stared at me in disgust , called me twisted and irrational , or worse : turned away and pretended that it did not exist ? How many more will do the same ? <newline> <newline> I ca n't continue this way . If a lie were never discovered to be a lie , then it is as real as the truth . If I maintain this illusion of saneness and restrain these thoughts indefinitely , then it will have been as though I was always fine to begin with . I can not keep lying . I must not lie . <newline> <newline> And yet I can not say the truth . I do not want others to turn away . I do not want to endure the searing pain of being abandoned time and time again by those I thought I could trust . I do not want my hands to be decorated with tears , for my screams to sound like threatening howls of horror that nobody can understand . I do not want to tell the truth . But I do not want to lie . I do not speak . <newline> <newline> I can not scream . <newline> <newline> This is for You , whoever you may be . If you exist out there in this world and chance would favor us meeting , then I only wish to ask you one thing . <newline> <newline> Do not turn away in my moment of weakness . Do not twist your expression as I lay at your feet , a river obscuring my vision , as I say all that is there to think and think of all that there is to say . Do not utter scornful words as I look up in hope for even the briefest sign of benevolence from you . Hear me . I beg of you , please hear me and let me be heard ; acknowledge my pain , acknowledge my sorrow , and though you may not have the words to cleanse me of my guilt , vices , and regrets , at least smile upon me , not as a form of approval , but to let me know that I am heard . That I _exist_ . That I am *real* . <newline> <newline> Let me know that I am allowed to exist . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> <newline> A Liar .

5,"Dear Brianna , <newline> <newline> Kaden and a handful of my other friends often poke fun at me for even falling in love with you in the first place ; `` It 's just summer camp love , move on . '' `` Maybe if you gave her a call ... oh wait ! She 's deaf ! '' <newline> <newline> When we met that weekend in a grassy field I ca n't remember because all I cared about was you , we were lined up for breakfast , and I verbally asked your name . As though from many past experiences with hearing people like me , you turned to Natalie and asked her to tell me that you were Deaf . <newline> <newline> I had been taking ASL for two years at that point , and I excitedly waved my hand to get your attention , and introduced myself in your language . The look in your eyes , I ca n't even describe . There was a spark , a look of sheer joy that there was someone else you could talk too ! <newline> <newline> From that minute , I knew I loved you . <newline> <newline> The rest of that weekend , we talked about ourselves . Where we came from . I lived in Portland , and you lived in San Francisco . A tiny voice told me to leave you to stop me from hurting later on , just like it always told me whenever my heart ached for a girl . But you were different . You were adorable , funny , able to hold a conversation , willing to teach me more , allowing me to teach you , we swapped books and life stories . <newline> <newline> We fit perfectly together . <newline> <newline> Over the following four weeks , our time together was short ; we only saw each other from Friday evenings to Sunday mornings , and even then only for a few hours at a time . But we made the most of it . <newline> <newline> During weekend 4 , I was dared by a few friends to kiss you . Outwardly , I objected the thought , saying you were `` nothing more than a fling '' . But on the inside , I had been considering that myself for quite a while . That Sunday , as were parting ways , I told you what they had dared me to do . You laughed your adorable laugh , and told me to wait just one more week . <newline> <newline> The next weekend is the one I hope you never forget . We were going to go on a rec trip to Crater Lake , but I was pulled out of the group to go to the top of a nearby motorbike trail instead . And you left your sister and Shawntee , the only other Deaf people at our camp , to be with me . <newline> <newline> I loved you <newline> <newline> We hiked for half an hour , reaching the top a mountain covered in golden grass , beneath a cloud-dotted sky as blue as your eyes . You read a book in the shade of the sole tree in our area , and I sat next to you , enjoying the peace . I reached for your hand , you accepted . I moved my head to go for a kiss , you moved yours and met me halfway . It was both our first kiss . We locked eyes and kissed again , longer , more intimate this time . We moved our bodies closer together , laying together under that tree . <newline> <newline> That was the last time we touched . The next weekend , we had everything packed and you flew south to your home . We texted on and off for the next few weeks , but we have n't seen each other since . <newline> <newline> Brianna , I 'm sorry I never text you . I 'm sorry I 've never had you use the Skype account I made you create . I ca n't believe I have n't been able to overcome my anxiety for the one girl that loved me . <newline> <newline> I write so many messages that never get sent . <newline> <newline> Maybe I 'll send this one someday . <newline> <newline> Yours truly , <newline> <newline> Justin

5,"Dear Mum and Dad , <newline> <newline> I never thought I could tell you . I never wanted to tell you ... because how could I ? <newline> I did not do it to hurt you or anyone else in fact I did it so no one would have to be hurt by my actions anymore . <newline> <newline> I tried many ways of doing it- Rope , pills , bathtub , car accident . I never succeeded though tonight I am trying again . This time I am going for a more direct approach . <newline> <newline> I am sorry that when you read this it will be hard but one last big moment of hurt verses a life time of it does n't seem as bad to me . Just know that I love you and that I am forever thankful that you were my parents . You who have helped me so much , especially over this last year , you who have cared so deeply for me . Its why I know this letter will probably never get written in the end because I feel like a coward for doing this to you and could never face you for it . <newline> <newline> Alan and Emily , <newline> <newline> Do n't think I 've forgotten you . You two have been great siblings . I want you to know that this is not your fault , its no one 's 'fault ' , its my fear . I always looked up to you guys so much as to even try to follow in your footsteps of going to University and meeting someone who could change my life for the better like Lucy or Cillian has for you two . <newline> <newline> Dear friends , <newline> <newline> I am sorry I never told you what was happening but I am abandoned in a desolate shit hole in the north too far away from any of you to make a difference . I know you care because at least on facebook you tell me you do which may sound sarcastic but to me it means a lot , messages from months ago get me up to at least eat for the day . <newline> <newline> Steve I am so so sorry I missed your wedding , I tried so hard man I tried so fucking hard to make it there but I just could n't do it . Out of everyone and everything this was the hardest thing for me to miss . You have a son now and a wife . You have been through a lot and I was always there to help you growing up but now you do n't need me anymore . I wish I could have met your son and wife , to meet the woman who captured your heart would have been truly beautiful for me . Again I am so fucking sorry my friend . <newline> <newline> The reason why I am doing this is because I am terrified of life . My experiences have only ever resulted in my suffering . I know everyone falls and fails but for me it seems fucking endless . The money , the threats , the loneliness , the crushing anxiety and the resulting fear of them all are too much for me to handle day to day . I know I have n't mentioned this to any of you but I have n't been able to look outside never mind go outside for two months now . I barricade myself away in my room with the door locked , lights out and curtains closed because here I feel safe . No one can get to me here , no one can find me here . <newline> <newline> I know its wrong of me to say that I hope this does n't affect you because it most likely will , but forget me . I did n't mean enough to you for you to be here once in the past years so you should n't find it hard . <newline> <newline> As I live in fear and loneliness so too shall I die scared and alone . One last time I 'll lock the door after I get the knife from this kitchen . <newline> <newline> I love you all but its time . <newline> <newline> Bye Mum , Goodbye Dad , Bye Alan and Bye Emily . <newline> <newline> I am sorry for everything x

5,"Dear Brad , <newline> It 's been a couple years since I 've seen you and I know that I said I forgave you for what happened and that 's still true but the damage you did is still there , haunting me , holding me back . <newline> <newline> You were one of my best friends for 10 years , the guy I looked up to , the guy who looked out for me , the guy I fell in love with . You took that and you used it . You knew what you were doing . I 'm not going to write it out because it 's the past and it 's over . Reliving it ca n't make it better . The scars are still there and they are n't fading away . <newline> <newline> Because of you I honestly believe that no one could ever see me as anything other than a friend . You taught me that I am not enough of a girl to ever have anyone want me as anything more . <newline> <newline> Because of you I no longer believe in love . After all , I fell in love with my best friend , he made me believe that he loved me back and then broke my heart beyond repair . If the person I loved and trusted most in the world can do that to me why would I ever let anyone else close enough to me to let that happen again . <newline> <newline> Because of you I will never move back to our home state . I never want to see you again and I do n't want to explain to any of our old friends why we `` broke up '' our friendship or why we never finally got together . <newline> <newline> Because of you I know I 'm not beautiful enough , smart enough , strong enough , thin enough , fit enough ... I 'm just not good enough . For anyone . <newline> <newline> I will never understand why you took those steps forward and changed our friendship into something more if all you wanted was someone to fool around with while you mooned over your roommate and waited for her . You could have gone out and found any other girl to bide your time with . It did n't have to be me . But instead you continued on and I fell for it . I thought you loved me too and that 's why I gave all of myself to you . Or tried . <newline> <newline> Do you even know what it does to a girl 's psyche when she is in bed with the guy she loves , and he is seeing her for the first time completely exposed and he makes her feel things she has never felt before but then stops to say he has a crush on her sister ? You broke me and I honestly do n't know if I will ever be able to believe that anyone could ever care about me , love me , want me that way ever again . <newline> <newline> I hope you find the happiness you crave so badly but push away constantly . I hope you let go of her finally so that you can find the love you so obviously and desperately need in your life . If you have kids I hope you teach them about love and about friendship and you remember the girl from the bridge . The one you did n't hesitate to kiss . The one who loved you and understood you and was there for you , regardless of how many times you let her down those last three years together . <newline> <newline> I know I will likely never find the guy who will prove you wrong about me . Who will see me for me instead of what distractions I can offer . I know most of that is because I just ca n't believe anyone would ever want me because I did what everyone says , `` do n't try looking , it 's when you stop looking that you find the perfect guy and you fall in love with your best friend '' . I did exactly that . I gave up on guys and love and then somehow a switch was flipped with us . Only , you forgot to love me back . <newline> <newline> Be safe . Wear your helmet . Keep drumming .

5,"Dear mom , <newline> I took a girl out for our first date tonight . I think it went well . She 's really wonderful . She 's poised , intelligent , has a great sense of humor ( as in she thinks my goofiness is charming ... so potentially delusional ) . She 's beautiful , but not just in the normal sense . Her smile lights up a room and best of all God shines through her and I see an authentic love for people and her personal faith . <newline> <newline> You came up . I did n't want to tell her too much . It has happened more than once that I tell a woman about my relationship with you and they run . I do n't blame them , but I really did n't want this girl to run . <newline> <newline> For the longest time I wondered if I 'd ever be able to have a healthy romantic relationship , if I 'd ever find a wife , if I 'd ever get over my distrust of women because of you . Every time I avoided getting too close to a girl out of fear , every time I was a nervous wreck half wishing the girl would n't show for a meet up , all the times I heard the lies you planted in me that I was n't worth a woman 's love ( partially out of guilt for how you made me feel I was treating you <newline> ) ; I cursed you . <newline> <newline> I 'm past the part of my life where I 'm angry and want to `` get back at you '' . I 'm writing you this because I was overjoyed at this evening spent with Martha and ... and I 'm brought to tears that I ca n't excitedly tell you about it the next morning . A grown man that should be past such sentimental silly things feels strongly the wound you made with a childhood of abuse . <newline> <newline> Mom , I know I 've been cold-hearted , that is true . God urges me to be compassionate and I have wanted to have my revenge so badly . But this is my triumph . <newline> <newline> Mom , I know you are a fallen person . Even if you will not acknowledge the pain you 've put me through , I forgive you . I choose to forgive the hurtful words you spoke about me . I actively process the pain you 've put me through in order to truly release it . I choose to forgive the violence you used to intimidate me as well as all the times you used flawed interpretations of scripture to manipulate me . I choose to release the burden I 've put upon myself when I neglected to forgive you all these years . Anything else I 'm forgetting to specifically mention or that is just adding to the list to where it begins to just be me complaining , it 's gone , forget about it . <newline> <newline> I just want my mommy , like when I was eight and needed you to kiss my boo boos . Or like when I needed advice on girls becoming a teenager , or when I needed you to help me so many other times in so many ways but I could n't come to you . I want to be happy about the possibility of you coming to my wedding and I do n't want to cringe thinking of you being around my children . <newline> <newline> To sum it up , I took a wonderful woman out tonight and had a great time getting to know her . She 's special in so many ways . Who knows how serious we 'll get , I 'm just enjoying things as they come . But my time with her made me realize how much of a wound I still have from you and the importance of forgiving you so that she does n't have to pay for you the whole time we 're dating . <newline> <newline> Some day maybe we can heal our relationship fully , your response to this delegates that to some degree , but I more so know that hating you and constantly being angry at you is too much effort . Effort I can put into blessing Martha with a man who cares for and honors her the way he 's supposed to . <newline> <newline> -Lugnut

5,"Dear N. , <newline> <newline> I 've been wanting to tell you a lot of things that have been on my mind lately . <newline> <newline> For starters , I can never seem to get you off my mind . Every single day , I somehow manage to think about you . I ca n't stop thinking about you . There are times where I want to hold your hand in the hallways and give you a hug before leaving for my next class but I ca n't . <newline> <newline> I miss times when we would spend time together , just the two of us . I miss when we cuddled in your car for two hours . I miss when we would send cute texts to each other every day . I miss the hour long conversations at night on the phone . <newline> <newline> I do n't blame you at all for not being able to spend time with me . I know that you are a very busy person , trying to juggle school and gymnastics at the same time . And I know that you care about me as much as I care about you . <newline> <newline> But I wish we could spend more time with one another . I wish that we could enjoy each other 's company without having to worry about schoolwork . I wish that amongst the chaos in our lives , we could calm each other by being together . I miss you . A lot . <newline> <newline> But I do n't know how I would be able to tell you this . I do n't want to ask for more time with you for fear of coming off as being selfish and only wanting for my own . I want to say what 's on my mind , but I do n't want you to think that I 'm too clingy . The truth is that I 'm just a very emotional person who sometimes lets my feelings get the best of me . <newline> <newline> Times where I do n't get texts back or days where we do n't call each other , I wonder if I 'm ever on your mind as much as you are on mine . I wonder if you 've ever thought about the things I 've been meaning to say to you . <newline> <newline> I want to call you every day , but I hesitate to because I do n't want to disturb you when you 're busy . But every time I do n't , I feel a little empty inside not being able to hear your voice . I want to spend time with you on the weekends or after school , but I do n't know if you have any spare time for me , being that you have so many obligations . <newline> <newline> There are times on the phone when we would talk about our plans in the future . You 've told me of how in college we could actually be with each other more than we are now . You talked of how we would visit each other 's dorms everyday and just hang out . To be honest , the thought of losing out on that scares me . You 're an amazing girl , and I 've never cared about someone so much before . <newline> <newline> Truth is , my biggest fear in all of this is the possibility of losing you . I know that it 's so dramatic to think like that , but at times when I 'm alone , it feels just like that . Every day I try to put on a smile and act as if everything is okay because I do n't want you to worry about me when you have so many other more important issues in your life . I do this , but I know that bottling up my feelings is not good for me . So that 's why I 'm writing to you in this letter . <newline> <newline> Remember that time when you said that I was too good for you ? Well that 's not true . I 'm the luckiest guy in the world to have been able to meet such a wonderful and amazing person such as yourself . You 're funny , creative , compassionate , humble , friendly , beautiful , charismatic , and so much more . Never let anyone else tell you otherwise . <newline> <newline> Know that you 'll always have a special place in my heart . I love you . <newline> <newline> R .

5,"Dear Megan , <newline> <newline> I was n't very popular in secondary school - I was strange and sheltered and was n't really noticed by people . I did n't mind this , as it was at least a step up from primary school , where I 'd been the target of most people 's ridicule . I do n't know whether I 'm allowed to say I was bullied , considering a lot of people have had worse experiences than me , but it often felt like that . I was an easy target due to being different : I did n't live on a farm , like most of the other children ; I was n't related to anyone there , and did n't have any siblings ; I excelled at spelling and maths , but was so bad at sport the teachers tried to put me in the `` special needs '' category in gymnastics despite me not having any kind of special needs . <newline> <newline> Come secondary school , a definite hierarchy began to develop . I was on the second-lowest level : people who were n't considered `` normal '' enough to be at a higher level , but had some sort of redeeming quality ( in my case , my intelligence ) which stopped us being the lowest of the low . I feel like class came into it as well ; most of my friend group , myself included , came from relatively privileged backgrounds . The one level below us seemed typically to consist of people who were just as socially disconnected as us , but typically less creative or intellectual , and primarily working-class . <newline> <newline> Having been used to being picked on as a child , I was determined not to repeat this experience , and felt the need to distance myself from that lowest bracket of people by disparaging those within it . At the time this felt like a means of self-defence . I now know I was hurting people . <newline> <newline> You were one of such people . I still do n't know why it was that my friends found you to be so annoying . We 'd spoken a little on the bus and you seemed alright . But the people I felt it most important to impress - my first proper friend group - seemed , for some reason , to strongly dislike you . As secondary schools go , it was pretty tiny - only 400 or so students . But for me , it was a big step up from the 30ish children in my primary school . I was afraid of anything that could possibly result in me being bullied . Though I 'm by no means proud to admit it , in the process , I became a bully . <newline> <newline> In hindsight , I do n't know how much you were actually aware of . The most notable thing I remember was the series of comics my friends and I used to draw in school : you were the villain . While a lot of effort and detail was put into other characters , you were drawn in a rough , cartoony style . I remember a song one of my friends made up about you that she 'd sing sometimes . Another used to make funny noises and pretend to be doing impressions of you . I realise , now that I 'm older , what awful people we were . People saw me as nice because I was shy and polite and helped them with their homework ; but really , I was as bad as any of the `` bitchy popular people '' I reviled . <newline> <newline> I completely understand if you have n't forgiven me , and I want to apologise for how I , and the rest of my friend group , treated you . I met up with them a while ago and mentioned how bad I felt about it ; one of them shared my remorse , which I was glad about . The other just said something along the lines of `` I remember Megan , she was annoying '' and how strange she found it that you had a boyfriend now . I hope in time she will also realise what she did . <newline> <newline> You deserved a much better school experience than we gave you . I know we were just immature 11-year-olds at the time , but we still had no excuse to behave as we did . I hope you 're doing well at the moment , and maybe one day I 'll have the confidence to tell you all of this directly . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry for everything . <newline> <newline> ~ Pippa

5,"Dear you , <newline> <newline> I 've always meant to write this letter to you , but I was never able to really put it all together . We 've gone through a lot together , to say the least . <newline> <newline> I guess I just wanted to say thank you , for everything . For your generosity , for your openness , your pride , your confidence . I truly admire you as a person . <newline> <newline> In this world , there are many different types of people . I always believed in a world of people who truly want the best for others . Before I learned that I was a little naive , I believed in a world that lived together . As humans placed here on this planet together , with the best , the shining examples of our race claiming brotherhood and kindness for all , how could one not believe them ? <newline> <newline> This is n't the truth . Quite the opposite in fact . <newline> <newline> People are hateful and selfish . They will lie and cheat and steal just to better their own situation . The entire world is drowning in themselves , and the worst will climb to the top by pushing your head under the water to keep themselves above the surface . It 's easy to succumb to those who are only here to ruin you . You know that better than most . <newline> <newline> You know , but you never embraced that thought . <newline> <newline> Of all the adversity you faced from the first day of your life , you could have blamed your troubles on the unfairness of the world . You could have closed yourself off from the world and never taken responsibility for the life you were given , but you did n't . <newline> <newline> As much as you struggled , as much as you had to fight , giving up was never an option to you . You 've always known inherently that the problem was n't with you , it was with the world . It was the defining characteristic of your personality . You looked at everyone that ever doubted who you were and knew in your heart that they were wrong . While everyone was busy tearing each other down , you built yourself . You built the person that everyone is envious of . <newline> <newline> You have always known that you love yourself . It 's the source of the world 's envy . <newline> <newline> It 's why I love you . <newline> <newline> Some souls are chosen from birth to face the awful side of the world because they are stronger than others . <newline> <newline> I just want to thank you for creating something beautiful with the adversity that nature posed against you . For creating you . <newline> <newline> I also wanted to say I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I was n't as strong as you . <newline> <newline> I should 've stood beside you . I should 've taken a stand . I should have done so many things for you that I was never capable . <newline> <newline> But when I found myself , <newline> <newline> When I realized who you were , <newline> <newline> When I was finally able to stand with you against the opposition , <newline> <newline> When I believed in us , <newline> <newline> You never even considered if I was worthy . <newline> <newline> I am a vengeful person . I remember every one of the persons in my life that ever mistreated me , but when I came to your door looking for what you had all along , you had forgotten I ever wronged you . That 's why you 're the greater person than I. I thought you would remember the worst of me , the part of myself I ca n't leave behind . But you did n't . <newline> <newline> On the contrary you opened yourself to me . You 're so closely guarded ... you have a right to be too , but you let me in . From the first day you let me in . The side of you that so few see , you let me in so easily . You saw more in me . More than I believe I deserved . It 's why we are what we are to each other . <newline> <newline> From my experience with the world , people are hateful and selfish ... but a person ? A person is kind . A person is generous . A person is forgiving . <newline> <newline> That 's who you are . <newline> <newline> From my experience with the world , there is a reason there are so few great people . From the hate we experience , the anger , the worthlessness others feel that is thrown onto us , only the few great rise above it all . <newline> <newline> Only few recognize the truth in the world . I recognized you . You recognized me . <newline> <newline> Thank you , again . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , me

5,"Dear Pops , <newline> <newline> You were a real fucking piece of work you know that ? I do n't think I 've hated anyone quite as much as I hated you . You called me lazy , good for nothing , useless . Made me spend my youth being the mule in your construction business instead of spending summers with my friends . You absolutely hated the fact that I loved everything you did n't . You thought computers were evil , Xbox was going to rot my brain , and if it did n't involve school or work it was n't anything worthy of my time . I remember the day I came home on college break , the day you sat me down to let me know mom had left you . I fucking hated you for ruining my 3 week break on the very first day . In fact I thought you deserved it . Mom was being an absolute irrational cunt , but you deserved it . And it was the best thing that ever happened to you . <newline> <newline> I remember you tripping over a chair on the way out the door at 3 am as you were reaching for your truck keys . I came into the kitchen and you said you were headed out for a ride , I decided to tag along . You bawled your fucking eyes out on that ride , it was the first time I 'd ever seen you be human . The last two weeks of my break we spent a lot of time together , I was actually sad to leave . It was the first time in 18 years we 'd had conversations that did n't end in Fuck off . I moved in with you after college was over , and decided not to go back . You let me work for you which was the best/worst time I 've ever had . I watched you lose your truck , we sat on the couch watching TV for two weeks when there was no work . We had bill collectors call once and talk to both of us . We ate more peanut butter and ramen noodles then we 'd ever care to admit . We became really really good friends . <newline> <newline> In hind sight I 'd like to apologize for the seething hatred I threw at you growing up . I know you meant well . I 'm probably better for you not giving me everything I wanted and pushing me like you did . That 's no justification for all the mean shit you said day in and day out but I can look past that . You had a different way of helping , you were a string puller , and I get that as I 've become one myself . Remember when I crashed my car coming home from the store ? The roads were pure ice , and you were pissed . Remember how mom said it was amazing that my insurance did n't go up ? Yeah I heard that phone call . `` Just slid off the road '' did ya ? And that time I applied to work at the general store in town ? You talked to the owner on my behalf and said he did n't want me working there . I was pissed . Two months later he was charged with embezzlement and all the employees were implicated . I did n't miss that one either , or the other hundreds of times things mysteriously worked out for the better . <newline> <newline> It was a good 4 years to live and work with you pops . I saw you genuinely happy , we both hit financial bottom and picked ourselves up again . You had a massive heart attack that that inspired me to go into the medical field , and you to kick those life long bad habits you 'd been promising to kick . You met a new woman , fell in love and remarried . Which is for the better . Someone 's got ta keep an eye on your crazy ass . But I knew you were bummed you had to quit construction . It 's all you 've ever done and you were fucking good at it . You certainly did n't have the money or the personality to retire and I doubt you ever will . Good thing that sales job opened up when it did huh pops ? Good thing thing too , cause you 're fucking great at it . I knew you would be . And it 's the least I could do . <newline> <newline> With your new found financial stability I 've seen the dreams I never even knew you had come to fruition . You spent a whole week hunting this year . Those three hundred blueberry bushes you always wanted are planted and you even sold some . You got your tractor you always talked about buying but never did . And my fucking god . I do n't know what you see in chickens but you have them and if it makes you happy , well fuck it , I guess I 'm happy too . We had a rough start , but you 've always had my back even if I did n't know it . And do n't think for a fucking second I do n't have yours . <newline> <newline> Love , <newline> <newline> Your Son .

5,"The following is based on the reality of my life ... <newline> <newline> ( 2003 ) <newline> Dear , <newline> <newline> Today I broke your heart . Turns out I broke my own as well . I was sorry instantly , but I could not undo what I had done . <newline> <newline> We had something wonderful , but it was too much for me . I have realized that I need to figure out what is broken inside and fix it . You deserve to have a love that is stable , not this mess coming from my insides . <newline> <newline> I am going to get healthy , it is going to be my mission . The thought that I can get healthy enough to be with you is the dream that will support me through facing my painful childhood head on . <newline> <newline> Stay safe , I need you to stick around . You always dreamed of dying in battle , but I had been able to convince you of dreaming of dying old with me . You were always going to join the army , but you enlisted just a month after I left you . You had better keep your word . <newline> <newline> Though I can not tell you , since I have to let you go for now , you had better be here when I am the healthy woman you deserve . You are a part of my heart and soul . <newline> <newline> Always Yours <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> ( 2006 ) <newline> Dear , <newline> <newline> While it was a painful three years , I have done it ! Therapy two times a week , and some of my own extreme methods pulled out my childhood memories and I faced them . It was scary and painful , but you were always in my thoughts as my motivation . <newline> <newline> Sometimes a month was so rough I would send you an email for support , you know , because you never hated me even though I had left . You would always respond with kind words and support . When you could see the pain in my words , you would send me such love it would bring me to tears that you could still be so kind to me . You are the only person who would never get mad at me because you knew how much it would scare and hurt me . <newline> <newline> You would get frustrated sure , but you would never get mad . In response to an email from my darkest time , you sent me an email with the most supportive loving sentence `` TINTHIO you , AYSMST me . '' Those words mean the world to me , and they always will . <newline> <newline> When I knew I was ready , I decided to tell you even though you had moved on and had a girlfriend . Waiting to hear your response was brutal ... but your love for me was still alive ! You ended your relationship and we began to speak on the phone daily , since you were still stationed in the middle of the country . I can not describe the peace in my soul and the joy in my heart being with you as a healthy adult has brought me . I listened to your puns with love , and laughter about how damned ridiculous they were and how much you loved them . <newline> <newline> I miss you . You wo n't remember this part of the story , but while I waited for you to pick me up for the first time in three years , my heart blossomed . Then after waiting for two hours I left you a frustrated voicemail . After four hours of waiting I gave in and called your parent 's . <newline> <newline> Turns out I am no longer not -broken , turns out I am shattered . My heart died with you in the car crash to the airport to come home . I thought my childhood was pain ... . Turns out I was wrong . I considered ending it so I could join you , but you understand I have to stay to be here for my little brother and sister . <newline> <newline> I decided that your heart lives in me now , and mine is buried with you . I am no longer the same ... . I even changed my handwriting to all caps , so that my outer world would change with my inner world . <newline> <newline> Some have tried to tell me it is good you died before our love died ... Can you believe that ? I laughed , not everyone marries their high school love , but we were made for each other . It took a long time , but now I can smile . I miss you constantly , but I can keep this inside . <newline> <newline> It has been almost ten years since you left me now , I still hold out my hand when I am alone to pretend I am holding your hand , just in case you can . I still write different and I still feel this hole in my soul . <newline> <newline> But I live , and one day I will find out if I can meet you again . I could go on for hours and thousands of words about my love for you , but I must move on . For you , I end this with the following : <newline> <newline> Yesterday I accidentally swallowed some food coloring . The doctor says I 'm OK , but I feel like I 've dyed a little inside . <newline> <newline> Forever Yours

5,"Dear Mom and Dad , <newline> <newline> I probably should have told you this sooner for the sake of my mental health , but now I am safe from you and your disappointment , rage , sadness , and whatever you may do once you 've read this letter . <newline> <newline> I 'm not who you think I am . Since middle school I slowly began to realize that I do n't believe in your God , I do n't believe Jesus died for anyone 's `` sins '' and I do n't believe that hating gays does anyone any good . The only thing I liked about our church was the community there . Even a more liberal church would not befit me , because of my aforementioned lack of belief . I do n't care if the Holy Spirit is going to give me the grace to believe and trust in God because that 's not going to happen , mother , no matter how often you drag me to church after a late night , taking up half a day that would be better used for sleep or studying . <newline> <newline> I also am a liberal even in politics . I 'm pro-choice and I 'm pro- everything that you hate and can not believe people could ever like . I 'm gay , bisexual to be exact , I 've had sexual relationships better than any of yours ever were or could be because I am not afraid to talk about it or anything else with my friends who you think are such a bad influence on me . All they 've done is bounced my own thoughts back at me and exposed me to their parents and their lives- by doing that they helped me realize just how much I can not stand to live with you because their parents are so much more open and accepting that it makes me want to cry because of how much I felt boxed in and trapped and stuck living a life that is n't mine . <newline> <newline> Yes , you 've both done a lot for me . But Mom , Dad was there for me a lot more than you were . He was available even when I did n't want him and I appreciate that a lot more than your constant worrying about grades or how all I need to do is practice more or study more when that 's really only part of what I need to do . So thank you dad . <newline> <newline> I ca n't be in contact with either of you unless you can accept me as I am and not just part of me . Hate the sinner , love the sin is such utter bullshit that I can not see how it could ever make sense . If you hate that I am bisexual you are hating a part of me that I can not change and I will not pretend to . I may end up with a female partner or a male partner but either way I will still be bisexual and if you will only acknowledge me in my entirety when I 'm with a man , then I can not accept your support because it wo n't be unconditional like a parent 's love and support is supposed to . <newline> <newline> I ca n't be in contact with you if you refuse to recognize that I do n't believe in God . I do n't think there is some higher power up there or some virgin gave birth to a baby boy just because she ca n't have been lying about it because some old book written thousands of years ago by men , old and fallible men , said she was . The Bible is full of inconsistencies and flaws and I can not find it in me to believe in something so vague and unproven . <newline> <newline> If your reaction to this letter is anything but love and acceptance , I no longer want to be your daughter and I will not be manipulated into changing my mind or hating myself because of this like you have in the past . <newline> <newline> Best regards , <newline> <newline> Me ( when I am financially independent )

5,"Dear niece , <newline> <newline> First things first . I know it may seem that I have forgotten about you , or that I do not care about you , but that could not be further from the truth . I think about you every single day . I ponder how to separate you from the miserable life you are living . I think about how I could take you into my home and raise you in a relatively “ normal ” family environment . I just don ’ t know how to do it . I don ’ t know if you would want to . It is a large adjustment for someone your age to be moved around all over the place . A child needs roots in order to grow . You have never truly had roots though . You ’ ve never had the opportunity to grow and it is devastating to watch . <newline> <newline> You my dear , are surrounded by emotionally immature adults . It is extremely hard to reason with your mother . She is my sister , one among 5 and the one that I get along with least . This is for many reasons beyond my control . She was the last born before me and since our older sisters did not live with us growing up she was the “ middle child ” of the home . I took away her baby status and she has hated me for it . I don ’ t blame her though . As the baby there were a lot of perks . Like our Dad was finally old enough to realize that hitting kids is not a way to control them . I only got hit by him once in my memory . I do however remember him hitting her on a few occasions . She received very poor treatment by the hands of our Dad . She never matured past the date of our mother ’ s death . She is perpetually 16 and for that reason , she can never be a parent to you , the way she should be . <newline> <newline> Our Dad was put up for adoption at a young age . I think around 4 or 5 . Everything was great and then the war happened . WWII . Our ( adoptive ) Grandpa went to war , and was captured by the Germans . He spent time in a POW camp and experienced many horrific things . After the war he came home and it is my understanding that he experienced Shell Shock or better known today as PTSD . The PTSD created many traumatic events for our Dad . He saw his father deteriorate and drink and become abusive . Growing up , that ’ s the life my father experienced , so he learned it and did it to his kids . That ’ s how he thought someone parented . He passed it on to your Mom and she is passing it on to you . I ’ ve tried to break the cycle in my home . The problem is , you can only break it , if you can see it . <newline> <newline> I believe I was only able to break the cycle because I got out of my Dad ’ s home by the age of 14 and lived with your other older Auntie . She was able to let me see a different way of loving someone . A kinder and gentler way ( she also got out early and lived with one of our Mom ’ s friends ) . Also , your Grandpa did show me warmth . He never did show it to your Mom . She disappointed him from the start , only he will ever know why . He is simply a manipulative , controlling asshole . Simple as that . <newline> <newline> I know it doesn ’ t make up for the behaviour of your Mom , but it does help to answer why . I am simply trying to tell you that the reason that she can ’ t raise you with love is because she was never shown love . Our Mom was unable to protect her , she tried the best she could . Except , she died . That ’ s when all growth stopped for your Mom . She does love you , she does . I want you to know none of any of the behaviour of the adults surrounding you is your fault . You are an innocent child in a very tumultuous family cycle . <newline> <newline> Now , I know you ’ re making mistakes . Of course you are ! How could you not be ? You need to be able to cope somehow , and the best way to do that is to with drugs and alcohol . After all , it is all you have known , that ’ s how you ’ ve seen all the adults in your life cope . It ’ s not the only way though ! You just need someone to support you and give you the love and roots necessary to grow . <newline> <newline> I want to take you and care for you . I desperately do . I want to help you change your life , like your other Auntie did for me . I wasn ’ t always there for you in your life , because I don ’ t know how to break through all the barriers separating us . There are so many . The biggest thing I want you to know in all of this rambling is that , I love you . I think you ’ re amazing . Even with all the crazy shit you ’ re doing now to try and escape your life , I have been there . I have done it and I hope you come through the other side . I know what it is to pray to a god you don ’ t believe in , to want to be taken away . To be placed with a new family . A “ normal ” one . I know what it is like to wonder why nobody is coming to help you . I want you to know , I want to . I desperately want to . I just don ’ t know how to get there . I LOVE YOU ! You are special ! You are kind ! There are 4 other Auntie ’ s that all LOVE you . We just don ’ t know how to save you . <newline> <newline> Love Auntie . <newline> <newline> Edit : Missed a word <newline>

5,"Dear , Jeff . <newline> <newline> I 'm sure , somewhere in the labyrinth that is your mind there exists the idea that you are a good , kind , emphatic person . Who is right , and just , and reasonable . <newline> <newline> I can not discount this thought entirely , because while I have known you most of my life , I am after all , but merely your son . <newline> <newline> Despite your casual racism , I feel certain that you feel it is justified , even if people give you strange looks when you say , `` Typical dot , '' while driving recklessly . <newline> <newline> You call , or text me , once every three months . For the past two years you have done this . Despite the fact that every time this has transpired that *I* have answered , it has been a painful conversation for you , often ending with . `` Stop calling me . '' <newline> <newline> You may not understand this . I know . You feel I am unfair , that I should simply forgive your transgressions because it has been nearly ten years since they have occurred on a regular basis . <newline> <newline> But , you see . That 's how this works . I will never forget the day we went deep sea fishing . It was the only activity left at that point in my life in which you did n't casually demean me every third or fourth word you said . On this particular day , the currents were much stronger than you had thought . Surprisingly , you were n't alone in this shock . Normally , this would n't be an issue . A hundred plus foot boat often has weights to spar . <newline> <newline> But not that day , it was packed . So we got tangled constantly with other peoples lines . I saw you get frustrated . I grew more and more apprehensive about asking you to untangle me , because of course you 'd never show , or teach me how to do it myself . But I asked you anyway . Because who *else* was I going to ask ? <newline> <newline> Then I asked you . Then you yelled loud enough for the entire boat to go silent . `` I wish you were n't my son . '' <newline> <newline> I feel , in my early twenties , that it 's a sad thing when a 14 year old understands , intellectually , that what was just said to him was an emotional outburst . <newline> <newline> Although , even if I understood . It still hurt . That was the last time I allowed you to take me anywhere publicly . <newline> <newline> You seem very unhappy now , that your Mother died , two years ago . As far as I know now , no one in the family will speak with you . You know , you 'll probably read this and think I just fabricated that entire fishing trip . I did n't . I 've told you about it three times now . Each time , you claimed to have no memory of it . <newline> <newline> Interesting that , I suppose . I 'm sure people in a number of fields would love to study you . It may gain them insight into a mind falling into insanity , or deeply sated emotional and mental issues that have somehow remained unchecked for fifty years . But really , I doubt you care about that . You barely understand how basic concepts like why the moon glows at night . Most of this last paragraph is probably , `` Worthless doctors do n't know anything . '' To you . That 's fine . <newline> <newline> What you want to know about is me . So I suppose , I 'll tell you something . <newline> <newline> You know how you 're xenophobic ? Ah , I 'm sorry . You do n't know what that means , probably . You hate things that are n't American ? <newline> <newline> You know , Fuckin ' 'Merica ? <newline> <newline> I love anime . That 's from Japan . It 's cool . I went to Otakon last this year . I 'm going again next year . It was awesome . <newline> <newline> I also really fuckin ' dig science fiction and fantasy . Which I guess to you is like saying I love hitler and I hang out with Satanists . Which is actually on my to due list . Those guys troll like masters . Plus they actually seem pretty awesome . Have you heard about them helping one of their members fight the state so they could get an Abortion ? That was sick . <newline> <newline> Video games . This actually helped me learn IT . Which is what I 'm trying to do for a living . But my experience in IT means that I got the job I have now . Which is n't awful . It 's even full time . I did this by myself . <newline> <newline> Without *your* help . But not without help entirely . I learned how to ask for that . It 's great . A friend of mine helped me write my resume out to make sure I did n't sound like an asshole . It helped . <newline> <newline> So yeah , I really like video games . Too bad you ca n't do anything about that , I suppose . But really , they 're great . <newline> <newline> So are the books I read . I 've learned a lot by reading them . Too bad you were too terrified in your ignorance to even attempt to get me to read when I was younger , but then you 're probably frantically thinking of how awful I must be at this point , and how you need to fix *me . * <newline> <newline> Maybe by offering me money to hang out with you ? <newline> <newline> Because you know , I hate that . I *despise , * that . But you always seem to forget . <newline> <newline> The long and short of this is as follows . You are't my Dad . You are n't my family . <newline> <newline> You wo n't be spoken of to my children , if I have them . You wo n't be in my will . You barely even register as but a foot note in my life , and I 'm young yet . <newline> <newline> You wo n't live on inside of me . Your hatred , ignorance , and hurt you put me through does not even serve as the fuel that propels me forward . <newline> <newline> I do that . My friends do that , what I choose to give my life meaning does that . <newline> <newline> You may very well die alone , forgotten . <newline> <newline> A small small part of me feels horribly about that . <newline> <newline> But it 's a very small part , a precious part . <newline> <newline> The part of me that helps me be a better *person* , than I think you 'll ever know .

5,"[ NSFW . ] <newline> <newline> [ No seriously . Do n't read this if descriptions of rape or consensual sex with transpeople offend you . You 've been warned . ] <newline> <newline> [ But it 's not just about sex , I promise . And it 's true . ] <newline> <newline> Hey , LGTBQ community , it 's me , the one you rejected . <newline> <newline> We had some good times . I remember when I first kissed you . You were a transman , really muscular and smart , and I thought there was no way you 'd go for me . But you did . You got me into kink , too , and I discovered what it was like to be a submissive , to be owned by someone else . I remember the first time we had sex , my hands cuffed behind me , your silicone cock sliding down my throat . You took my breath away both literally and figuratively . I loved you . For a little while , you were my world . <newline> <newline> And you taught me a lot . I remember when I got drunk with you one night . As it always did back then , being drunk reminded me of that party , a long time ago , when I got really drunk and a girl had sex with me . I do n't remember anything , but when I woke up naked the next morning all my friends were high-fiving me . They told me I had lost my virginity . You were the first ones to tell me it was rape , and you were right . I got help , and I 'm doing a lot better . I do n't drink much any more , but when I do it 's in moderation , and I do n't spend my tipsy time thinking about being raped . And that 's in no small part because of you . <newline> <newline> And you were there for me through some tough times . When I came out to my parents . I had tried to explain to them what a transperson was , but they did n't get it . They tried to be supportive but it 's hard to be supportive when your son 's going to hell . <newline> <newline> But it seems like sometime , maybe a year ago , something changed . Maybe the social climate changed , or maybe the problems were there all along and I just started noticing them . The people who left when I came into a party because , `` I did n't know cis-men were going to be here , '' or , `` Let 's move somewhere without male gaze . '' Literally just me walking into a room of people I 've never met before , no interaction . <newline> <newline> I remember the time someone told me I could n't know what it was like to be raped , and then when I told them I had been raped , they said , `` Well , it 's not as bad for guys when you get raped . It does n't go inside you . '' It 's still inside me . <newline> <newline> I remember when someone was talking about rape and said it was about cis-men wanting power over other genders . And here I am , a cis-man who wants nothing more than to be dominated by a gentle transman , and I brought up that maybe rape is more complicated than gender and that sometimes women rape cis-men too . You said , `` That 's a distraction . '' <newline> <newline> I could have brought up then that I was raped by a woman , but I did n't want to tell you that . I did n't think I should have to share my private experiences for my voice to be heard . I did n't know what to say , so I just apologized . I said , `` I 'm sorry . '' I 'm sorry the worst thing that ever happened to me distracts from your uncomplicated narrative . Apparently complicated is okay when you 're talking about your gender , but it 's not okay when we 're talking about the gender of rapists and rape victims . <newline> <newline> Someone told me I can be an ally , and pointed me to a website where I can learn to help teach other cis-men not to rape . Great . I came out to my parents so I could be a tolerated outsider , and have my role in the community defined for me . <newline> <newline> The only reason I 'm still talking to you is that you 're my best option . Straight girls and gay guys are nice but then they want to have sex with me , which is okay , but kind of dissatisfying . If I talk to straight guys about this stuff , I either get polite highly sanitized , careful , and political answers , or they 're absolutely batshit and believe women should be raped . My family and ( ex- ) church believe that women ca n't get pregnant from rape because their bodies would reject the baby . So there 's really nobody I can talk to except you , and you 're a mixed bag . <newline> <newline> So often it 's just better , like tonight , to sit at home and not talk to you or anyone . To just try to not hurt for a night . To go on Reddit and avoid TheRedPill and TwoXChromosomes and try to distract myself with cat pictures or maybe some stories on WritingPrompts . <newline> <newline> Because I 'm tired of being the one in the middle who actually has to live out the results of the national debate you 're creating . And since I 'm tired , I have to rest up , because tomorrow I 'm going to go try again , to get on Fetlife and OKCupid and meet the dominant transperson who gets me . Because even though I 'm afraid of how you will see me and treat me , I 'm more afraid of failing and dying alone . <newline> <newline> And the thing is , this is all really disappointing because sometimes you really are good . The best members of the LGBTQ community are brave , thoughtful , creative , kind people . People that I can talk to . People I could fall in love with , date , maybe start a family . I imagine the joy of obeying my dom , of doing the laundry and dishes , of killing spiders if they wanted me to , or letting them kill the spiders if they wanted to , of learning to tango as follow instead of lead , of discovering the million ideas and wonders that you discovered in your own independent life , and decide to share with me . And I really hope we can do that instead of you rejecting me because someone else who looks like me hurt you . <newline> <newline> [ Final note . When I talk to the LGTBQ community in this post , I 'm talking to a lot of people . Some of the people I 'm referring to here , especially at the beginning , are really awesome people , who never did anything wrong to me . ]

5,"Hey brother , <newline> <newline> I ’ m sorry . <newline> <newline> I have a good life . One that I probably shouldn ’ t have . It all changed after the accident . It should be your life . <newline> <newline> I know that I was a big asshole back then . We had some very good times and the other times were me hating you or you hating me . Scratch that . I don ’ t think you ever hated me . <newline> <newline> I never thought I ’ d live pass 20 . 23 at the latest . So , I lived that way as well . I didn ’ t give a shit . The family “ cared ” . But you and Rachael , in retrospect , cared . So many signs . So many times reaching out . I ’ m such an asshole . <newline> <newline> When you died everything changed . Everything to everybody we know . It was surreal . Our sister Linda grew confidence somewhere and went to school out west . She ended up moving out there and has a great happy life . <newline> <newline> I got my shit together . There were bumps , but I realized very quickly how much of asshole I was and tried to change . It was more for the sake of mom and dad than anything else . I could n't bear the thought of hurting them anymore . <newline> <newline> Rachael never got over you . Every boyfriend , fiancee or husband she had she would compare to you . She would always confide in them about the accident . Always . And always how you saved her life that day . Always . She eventually married and had some kids . But she still talked to mom and dad like they were the grandparents . They were the kids that “ should have been yours ” . You saved her life that day , but something broke inside . It never healed , the wound as fresh as the day we had to pull the plug on you . What a horrible day . <newline> <newline> There was a time that Rachael kept calling me to get together . Not just a time , but times , over years . It was like she wanted to replace you with me . Man , what do you do ? So broken . I never met with her other than family events . I didn ’ t know what to do . <newline> <newline> Your old friends fell apart over the years as well . There was always a cloud over every gathering that related to your death or about Rachael contacting them for this or that . Even now , if I talk to any of them , there seems to be sad sense of reminiscence and nostalgia . It has been years and they won ’ t let go of the sadness . Sometimes it seems like they let it go , but it ends up finding its way back somehow , whether it is a friend of a friend that asks about you or a story about what Rachael did lately and how she can ’ t let go . <newline> <newline> Anyway , I eventually met someone . She ’ s funny and kind and my best friend . She ’ s way too good for me . I really don ’ t know how it happened . I mean , I know how , but it doesn ’ t make sense that she would have interest in me . <newline> <newline> We have a good marriage , a good living , a good life and great kids . Everyone says they have “ great kids ” , but they are . They are much better than me . Smarter , kinder , braver…better . <newline> <newline> I see all that I have and can ’ t help think that it all should have been yours . <newline> <newline> You were the guy doing the right thing . You were the guy with the fiancee . You were the guy that didn ’ t drink too much and didn ’ t do drugs . You were the guy that gave a shit . You were the guy that mom and dad talked about all the time . How happy they were when talking about you . <newline> <newline> You were the guy I hated so much at times . You were what I couldn ’ t be . What I shouldn ’ t be . What I didn ’ t want to be . You were lame . Cheesy . You didn ’ t “ understand ” why it was important for me to do the things I did . Why it was important to me to break mom and dad ’ s heart every day . Make them feel ashamed . Man , I was an asshole . <newline> <newline> You and Rachel tried so hard to get to me . You would take me places and do things with me . Sure , I was forced , but it always turned out better than I thought . You were reaching out in the best way one can imagine . I didn ’ t get . I didn ’ t get it until the day of the accident . Early that day , I kept thinking about how mom always had dreams of me dying in an accident like that . You both were taking me on a trip where the risk of it was much higher , so I couldn ’ t help but to think about it . I kept thinking , “ what if mom ’ s dream comes true ? ” . <newline> <newline> I realized I was OK with that . I realized that maybe that was for the best if it happened . I also realized that what you and Rachael were doing for me and loved you for it . I figured if such an accident happened , then so be it . I wasn ’ t afraid of dying . I was just happy that I finally “ got it ” and happy thinking about the good life that you two would have . I wish I told you before we got there how much I appreciated you and that I “ got it ” . How much I loved you for it . <newline> <newline> I wish it was me . <newline> <newline> But it wasn ’ t me . It was you . <newline> <newline> Mom ’ s dreams about me dying in an accident like that stopped occurring after that day . It wasn ’ t me in the dream . <newline> <newline> It was supposed be me though . It was supposed to be me . And now , the things you loved are broken and I have so much . I have what should have been yours . <newline> <newline> I don ’ t know what to do or what I could do . I ’ m just so , so sorry . <newline> <newline> The life I ’ m living is yours and the life you had , the people you loved most , they are broken and it seems like they will always be broken . <newline> <newline> Somehow I feel like I stole everything from you . I know it sounds silly , but I did . I never deserved all this . This wasn ’ t meant to be mine . <newline> <newline> I love you brother and miss you . Please forgive me .

5,"Dear Dad , <newline> <newline> I tell myself every day that I do n't want to know anything about your life now . I am who I am today because of you . You were selfish , cruel and horrible during the entirety of my childhood . You would never read this letter anyways , because to you I meant less than nothing . <newline> <newline> Just something to beat on when you were angry or frustrated . Someone that did n't mattered , a sexual toy that was never meant for you . Someone else that you abused mentally , physically , sexually and emotionally . You took so many things from me and even today you feel like you were doing something I wanted . Who would have wanted that ? No one deserves that . <newline> <newline> What four year old would decide that they enjoy being molested ? Beaten when they make mistakes ? Being screamed at in their face every time they said anything to you when you were n't in the mood to listen ? Being told how ugly , and worthless they are ? <newline> <newline> What eleven year old would want to stop wearing shorts to try and keep you away ? Who would want to fatten themselves up and wear dark colors to keep you away ? I did . And still , you felt I was asking for it . I barely spoke and almost never made eye contact with people . I had a younger sister that I tried my damnedest to save from you . I sacrificed myself to you to save her from your disgusting habits . I sacrificed myself to you to feed my siblings during the summer , after a week of eating nearly nothing . <newline> <newline> I still ca n't leave dishes in the sink because mold freaks me out . That 's how I conned you out of your 'hard-earned ' money , by waiting until the dishes from *your meals* pile up enough and grow mold so I could persuade you to pay me to clean them for you . Then I would take my siblings for food , because they were starving and we were too afraid to say anything to you . You 'd have beaten at us , raged at us . We did **not** deserve that . <newline> <newline> When I was thirteen and I was just so tired of my life that I wanted to die . I just wanted you to stop asking me to have sex , I tried to tell you no . I tried to get you to stop . When you raped me , I laid in a bathtub for two hours trying to make the pain go away , until the water grew cold twice over and you started to bang on the bathroom door demanding for me to come out . That was not how I wanted to lose my virginity . To have it ripped from me in an act of violence , from a man who was so disgusting that I ca n't even think about what you did to me . <newline> <newline> Then you tried to contact me , years after I finally got away from you . After I exposed you to the world because you had taken everything precious from me and I did n't care about your death threats anymore . I knew my mother was too far from your awful reach , my siblings would be safe even if you murdered me , because I would have exposed you for the monster you were . I laughed at you when you said that you had gotten into a car accident and broken your neck . I laughed at the world until I cried because fate had the *option* to just wipe you off the earth and some how you happened to be one of the few people on earth who did n't die after having their neck broken . And you acted like I was high and mighty for wanting nothing to do with you . <newline> <newline> All those times during my childhood where other adults tried to convince me that you 'd changed . That the anger management meant you would be a new man . I have trouble trusting anyone the way they 're meant to be because of you . Even the ones I love , I will never trust them because of you . Do I think you 've won ? I have trouble looking in the mirror . All of those years when you told me over and over about how ugly and fat I was helped me develop an eating disorder . Do I think that you won ? All of those years you told me no one would ever really love me , and I ran away from every genuine relationship I had - do you think I believe you won ? Those days when I would lay by myself in the dark and hear the words you 'd spit in my face and believed that they were true - those were bad days . But they are not my reality any more . <newline> <newline> I do n't think you won . I am stronger than you . I will never be a drug addict like you . I will hold jobs like a boss and never let anyone down like you . I have tried for nearly a decade to get pregnant and worried about scarring from your rape of me keeping me from the family I want - but no matter what , I will **always** be a better parent than you . I learned everything not to be from you . I will never hit a loved one . I try and succeed to push down the parts I feel are related to you , and cry instead of getting angry because that means you lose every time . I am **not** stupid like you tried to convince me . I will always be smarter , stronger and better than you . <newline> <newline> Those days you pretended to be sweet to win me over so you could take me home from the orphanage will never be forgotten . They would slowly convince me over time to trust you , and then when you finally brought me home with you and intimidated me into becoming your slave , I let myself become who I am now . <newline> <newline> Sometimes I think of what would happen if I met you today . I think I would be afraid of you - but realistically you are an old man now and I am a human in my prime . You are nothing to be afraid of , just a worthless piece of trash that used and abused anyone you could get your hands on . I never speak about you unless I have to , so you are n't going to be infamous through me . You 're just a nameless , faceless Unknown . And you matter so little to me these days that I just want you to know - I forgive you . Not for you . You will rot from the inside of your soul and I hope it is a slow and painful death somewhere that you ca n't hurt anyone anymore . I forgave you for me , because you are n't worth the energy or time that hate takes . I forgave you so I could forgive myself for not standing up for myself and exposing you sooner . For not allowing myself a real childhood , or to be a normal teenager worried about their first sexual adventures . <newline> <newline> I forgive you so that I never have to think about you , because you are not worth my time . <newline> <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> <newline> NotYourVictimSince2006

5,"Dear David , <newline> So many things have happened since you left . As you know , dad is gone too . Mom has n't handled losing you or dad very well . Ok , that 's putting it mildly . Mom has lost her shit and gone off the deep end . You would n't believe the difference . Drugs . Alcohol . Living with an addict thy she has professed her undying love to . I know , right ? ? I 've only talked to her three times this year and have n't seen her in over a year . <newline> It 's not all bad since you left though . Beck is now a mother ! Yes , our baby sister ! She has a little boy named Michael ( yes , the very name she had picked out when we were all little kids ! ) . She also has daughter named Eleanor ( I picked the name ) . And here 's what you will find amusing ... .they were BOTH born with flaming RED HAIR lmao ! ! I know ! ! After Beck used to swear if she ever ever had a red headed kid she 'd dye their hair lol . They are perfect and beautiful and glorious . When I was in the waiting room all I could think about is that no one would understand how excited I was except for you . It was bittersweet . <newline> Beck is married but you would have killed him and I would have helped you bury him if you were still here . *sibling high five* But he is quickly being out of the picture . It 's hard for Beck but she 's in school so she can provide a life for herself and the babies . She 's a good egg . <newline> Ok , life . Clint and I are still together ! He 's the best . We talk about you all the time . Although , he usually lets me bring you up because , well , you know . You were my baby brother . Anyway . You met Lydia . She was three months old when you left . She 's spectacular . She getting married in February ! She has the best head on her shoulders . Beautiful . Smart . Just like her mother lol . You never met Matthew . He was born a little over a year after you left . And let me say ... he reminds me so much of you . There were days when he was little that it was painful to see him doing things you could never do . Then there where days that made me say `` Ugh ! you remind me so much of your uncle David , I just want to knock the shit out of you ! '' ... lol . He 's a freaking genius . He 's so sweet and nurturing . He will make an excellent dad and husband one day . ( Just like his dad ) <newline> I do n't know if you know this but you have made a huge impact on their lives . Go ahead . Gloat all you want . I told them all about you . I 've told them every funny story about us that I can remember . I know there are ones that I do n't remember . Ones that you have the other side of the story . Stories I wish I remembered , that left with you . How things happened from your perspective ... .anyway . Lydia told me one day she forgets that she never actually knew you . Made me smile . <newline> Now for me . I 'm doing great . I 'm still happily in love . Like , stupid in love . We are the couple that you and I would have made fun of lol . He misses you too . He misses dad too . The big news in my life : I went blonde . I know , I know , Brunette forever and all the jazz . I do n't want to hear it lol . I 'm old . Well , older . So much older ! It 's been ... what ? ... 20 years ? Has it really been that long ? I seems like yesterday . But then again with you , and now dad , gone it seems like so long ago . Like it was a different life . Another persons life . But it was my life and it had you in it . And now it does n't . It 's starting to creep in while I 'm writing this . That feeling . The one that has me hyperventilating in my bed . The one that has me so angry at God . The one that makes me not able to have someone mention you because the cut is still so raw , that I feel I would bleed to death if I had to talk about you . I actually get so angry sometimes when I hear other people talk about you . They talk about how great you were . How courageous you were . How much better off you are . How lucky I was to know you . And . I . Just . Want . To . Scream . Fuck them . I want to tell them you were not perfect , that you were a little shit little brother who would hid my stuff and get mom to side with you ! I want to tell them that they have no idea what courage was ! How I listened to you scream and beg for mercy every time we had to bathe you . Or during those horrible procedures . Or ... everyday of your fucking life . How much better off you are ? ! You are gone . You are never coming back . I will never be able to laugh with you again . How lucky I am to have known you ? ? ? They do n't know . There are nights were I lay in bed wondering ( torturing myself , really ) if it was worth it for you ? Was it really worth me knowing you if it meant you living the life you were dealt ? ? Can you justify a child living and dying in horrific pain for just the pleasure of me knowing them ? I do n't know . It took me years to not be so angry at God . Years . And I 'm not going to lie , there are still days where I do n't think too much of him lol . <newline> I wish I could just know if it was all worth it ? Were the good times worth all of the shit you had to endure ? 16 years of pain and suffering . I hope it was . I think I could go crazy if I did n't think it was worth it . I have to believe it was worth it . Please . God . <newline> Anyway , like I was saying . I 'm good . <newline> I am sorry though . For all those times I would get so frustrated with you . I know . It was all big sister/little brother crap , but I 'm here and you 're gone . So . It 's different . I get to regret and rethink and rehash all of our arguments and fights that happened between teenaged me and teenaged you . 16 . Gone at 16 ... .. Anyways . I love you . I think about you every single day . If I 'm being honest , probably every hour . Do n't flatter yourself . Lol . I miss you so bad . But I would n't bring you back to live like you had to live . I love you more than that . I do . <newline> So , say hi to dad for me and give him a hug and kiss for Lydia and Matthew . And I 'll see you both soon . But not too soon ... .lol . I love you kiddo . ~forever your big sister , Angel . <newline>

5,"First of all , I want to make something perfectly clear . If you read nothing else in this letter , if you crumple it up and throw it away , read this line : it is my wish to never see you again , never speak to you again , and never communicate with you again , and that is MY choice , I have not and will never be persuaded otherwise by anyone , especially my mother . <newline> <newline> In the last letter you sent me , you wrote : `` there are three versions of every story , my side , her side , and somewhere in the middle is the truth '' . Here 's the thing : somewhere in the middle , the truth ? That 's my version . And it lines up with my mom 's version . Your version is wrong . You are wrong . You are an alcoholic and you abused all manner of drugs , why on earth would your version be close to correct ? You are wrong . <newline> <newline> You are my father . You were supposed to keep me safe . You were supposed to be there to comfort me when the world was rough . You were supposed to teach me things . The only thing I ever learned from you was fear . The last time I tried to have this conversation with you was a decade ago , when I was 15 . You dismissed me with a wave of your hand , claiming that I was `` shitting in diapers when ( my ) mother was making up these stories about ( you ) `` . That 's a lie . It 's a LIE . I remember things you ca n't because my brain is untouched by alcohol , Marijuana , Crack and cocaine . And you 're a fucking liar . Even if your brain was normal you would lie about what you did . <newline> <newline> Let 's pretend that I do n't remember the time you stumbled into my room drunk , at 4 am , and stepped on and broke one of my toys . Let 's pretend you did n't turn the lights on and scream at me and make your 4 year old get out of bed and hurriedly pick up all her toys , before you could get a garbage bag and throw them away . <newline> <newline> Let 's pretend I do n't remember hearing you scream at and hit my mother . Let 's pretend I did n't sit at the top of the stairs and cry quietly , waiting for you to go to bed and praying that this time was n't the time you would kill her . <newline> <newline> Let 's pretend , even though a police report states otherwise , that you did n't hunt us down like animals after we finally got away , that you did n't show up at 10 O clock on a school night and tell us that we were going to spend time with you while our mom stayed in the trailer . Let 's pretend you had n't cut the lines to the propane tank before you busted in because you were planning on burning her alive inside when we were out . Let 's pretend you did n't get mad at me when I refused to leave with you . Let 's pretend that you did n't slap your 8 year old daughter so hard that she fell off of the chair she was sitting on and got a bloody lip . That was me . You did that to me . But let 's pretend that I do n't know what I 'm talking about because I was too busy shitting in my diapers . ( 8 year Olds use the bathroom but let 's pretend . ) <newline> <newline> If we stop pretending , we can talk about what happened on Christmas eve 2008 . I was 19 . 19 years old . Jake and Ryan were 17 and 14 and they decided they wanted to see you . I do n't know where Alyssa was . I had decided I was n't going to see you again if I could help it . I went with my mom 's boyfriend to drop off Jake and Ryan to you . I was sitting in the front seat , reclined all the way back , so you would n't see me . <newline> <newline> You drove up and got mad because you saw our mothers boyfriend . You did n't just neglect to hit the brakes , you hit the gas pedal on your car and you smashed into our car . The car that had 2 of your children in it that you knew of , but actually I was there too so it was 3 of us . That happened . Jacob and Ryan were there . They remember it . You ca n't take that away from me . There 's no `` version '' of how that went , that 's just what happened . <newline> <newline> Let me tell you want happened after that , which you do n't know about . I had been dealing with depression and post Traumatic Stress Disorder for about a year . The PTSD , my therapist tells me , is from surviving a childhood with you , the things you did to my mother and myself and to a lesser extent Jake Alyssa and Ryan . So you slamming your car into the car I was in , and the look of absolute rage and hatred that I saw on your face before you drove away , it threw me all the way back into the trauma . PTSD is what soldiers get . It was like I was put back into the war zone . <newline> <newline> I went home and I could n't sleep . I was convinced you were going to find me , hunt me down like you hunted us down all those years ago , and kill me . That 's what I felt . That was my reality . I did n't sleep for 8 days , and then finally , I realized I could n't live like that . I could n't do it . I could n't spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder , unable to sleep because of the nightmares you caused me . <newline> <newline> So I decided I was going to kill myself . <newline> <newline> Better yet , I would do the world a favor and take you out with me . I got in my car and I started driving to your house . I planned to drive through your bedroom because you had to be sleeping at that point . I drove 45 minutes to your house and then when I was 10 minutes away my car slid on some ice and I almost crashed into a guard rail . I stopped and turned the car off and cried . I turned around and checked into a psychiatric facility and was there for 7 days . <newline> <newline> That is something that happened to me as a direct result of something you did when I was 19 , and yet that is just the God damned tip of the fucking iceberg . <newline> <newline> So no , I will not lose my resentment . No , I will not forgive you . No I will not find out what your version of my childhood was . No I will not talk to you , no I will not speak to you , no I will not write to you . It 's part of the reason I 'm writing this letter on Reddit and not actually sending it to you , because I hate you so much and I fear you so much that the thought of communicating with you paralyzes me . <newline> <newline> For my siblings ' sake , because they did not see the things I saw and because you never hit them like you hit me and because they actually care about you , I will not wish you were dead even though a large part of me aches for that . I will not wish you ill . I do wish that at some point you will realize that you 're wrong . I want you to remember what you did to me . I want you to know that pulling a 7 year old out of a car and hitting her legs and ass with a stick until she bled because you were hungover and she was giggling is not okay . I want you to know that I was actually covering for Jake , because he was the one who was laughing , and that he came to visit me when I was in the psych ward and told me that he remembered that , even though he was only 5 . I wish you were there when my 17 year old brother was crying and apologizing for not getting beat with that stick when he was 5 because maybe I would n't be so messed up and maybe I would n't have tried to kill myself at age 19 if that one thing had happened to him instead of me . I want YOU to be the one to carry that fucking weight around . I 'm sick of carrying it . <newline> <newline> Most of all I want to WANT an apology . I do n't actually want one , because I do n't want to hear from you ever again . But I wish that I was n't so far gone that an apology would bring me some sort of closure . And I wish you had the nerve to own up to your mistakes and apologize on your own , like an adult . <newline> <newline> I hope , one day , you realize I was right . And I hope you hate yourself for it . I 'm only sorry I wo n't be around to see it myself . <newline> <newline> Goodbye .

5,"Dear [ . . . . . . ] , <newline> <newline> I need to tell you something , even though you already know . I ’ ve tried to talk to you about it in person some , but it ’ s so hard to vocalize . A letter lets me do it better ; gives me time to think , and the ability to phrase . I have a harder time keeping up in conversation now . My words get lost . I called the ginger ale a number field . I told you that I had to get my elephant . I told you , once , that an invisible woman was stealing my words . Every time I turn around it seems I don ’ t know what I ’ m doing . Truth be told , I don ’ t know what I ’ m doing . At least we know the word for why this happens : schizophrenia . <newline> <newline> I skirted around this word a lot . Tried not to believe in it . Told you that I wasn ’ t technically schizophrenic , I was schizoaffective . It ’ s true , there is a difference . But the difference isn ’ t in severity , like I was trying to imply . I still don ’ t have it as bad as I could have it . I ’ m semi-functional . And to the world that doesn ’ t know : I ’ m fully functional , even if a little odd . That ’ s part of why I ’ m writing this to you . I don ’ t think you , or others , know how bad it is , or how completely terrified I am . Despite my mixed up words , I still put on a pretty decent face . <newline> <newline> I hear a lot of things that aren ’ t there . I see them , too . For the most part , they ’ re benign . I hear alarms go off that aren ’ t there . I hear pigeons in my bathroom ( always pigeons , always bathroom , I have no idea why ) . When I hear people , I can ’ t quite hear them . I can hear their tone . It ’ s like they ’ re speaking in another room , and I ’ m listening behind the door . I tried to explain to your boyfriend that this was unsettling . I said it made it so I questioned reality more than other people . For instance , when I see a shadow on the wall , I double check to make sure it ’ s really there . When I hear birds outside , I can ’ t tell if they ’ re real birds , or like the pigeons in my bathroom . Your boyfriend asked why it mattered . I couldn ’ t answer him at the time , so I let the conversation die . But I was deeply hurt by that . Part of why it matters is it undermines everything I do , and takes up energy that I don ’ t have . When you go through the day , you get to be on autopilot . You get up , work out , eat , walk down the road , etc . And everything you see makes sense to you , because you ’ ve been taught that you can trust your senses . When you see something odd in the world , it ’ s just an oddity of the world . You can take it or leave it . When I see something odd , I can ’ t tell if it ’ s real . Because it could be made up by my crumbling biology ( thanks , Danielewski , for that phrase—it ’ s apt ) . What this does is rip certainty out from under me . I can ’ t trust my senses . That is so incredibly destabilizing . Your boyfriend pressed me on this . Since it ’ s mostly small things—shadows , bird noises , phones ringing—what ’ s it matter ? It ’ s not like I ’ m hallucinating bodies everywhere . <newline> <newline> The answer is because I have to know how sane I am . I have to . I ’ m terrified , so terrified , of getting worse . When I have bad episodes , it helps a lot to know that it ’ s an episode . So when something ’ s off , I need to know if it ’ s my brain or the actual world . I don ’ t even know if this is possible , but I hope that if I keep my awareness up , it ’ ll keep me from getting worse . I ’ m terrified of slipping into madness and not knowing it . I ’ ve heard that there are people who measure their lucidity in percentages . 50 % lucid . 80 % lucid . I ’ m probably 90 % lucid . I ’ m very lucky . About every 10 days or so ( is that math right ? I have no idea ) , I have a concerning episode—something more than just the birds . I don ’ t know how long they last . I lose that time . It ’ s gone . It could have been 10 minutes , it could have been 2 hours . It ’ s like waking up from something horrible . I ’ ll know what happened , I ’ ll have been “ lucid ” the whole time , but not so lucid that I had a sense of time . If I ever get to 50 % lucid , I ’ m just going to kill myself . Because that ’ s half a life . That ’ s just not worth it . That ’ s half a life that ’ s either not remembered , or filled with demons and fear . What kind of life is that ? You know how important my cognitive facilities are to me . I ’ m trying to be an academic . I can ’ t be an academic without a mind that works . <newline> <newline> I ’ ll tell you about the last episode I had . It was yesterday . I walked into my bathroom to get ready for bed . I wasn ’ t wearing a shirt . I got lost in my mirror . I stared at it a long time . I have no idea how long . But when I realized I had been staring a long time , it was because I had gotten cold . And then it happened . My body began to burble . My stomach rippled . It was like looking at a glitch . I couldn ’ t move—I probably could—but I just had to stand and watch . I was transfixed on my own body . I watched it morph . I watched it turn dead green . It became a face . My nipples were the eyes , and my belly button was the mouth . Then I was afraid . So afraid I can ’ t describe it . Afraid doesn ’ t cut it . I was horrified . Disgusted . My belly button was a tiny , grotesque mouth . So small , and so grotesque . Like a black hole I kept getting stuck in . Like a hole that would consume the whole world in its smallness . I was revolted , I wanted to get into a ball and hold my head in my hands . I wanted to get away . I wanted to cry . But still I was transfixed . I couldn ’ t get away from it . It was going to destroy me . With its fucking grotesque smallness . I don ’ t know how long it lasted . But eventually I left the bathroom , put on a shirt , went back and brushed my teeth in fear . <newline> <newline> I have a lot of fear these days . Fear of going completely mad . Fear of being perceived as completely mad . Fear of anyone finding out . I feel like if people find out , I ’ d be ruined . This isn ’ t a paranoia thing , this is just the fact that between two otherwise equally qualified people , there ’ s never a good reason to pick the schizophrenic one over the other . Why hire someone unstable , someone who loses time , someone who can ’ t function with any real consistency . If I don ’ t make it in academia , I ’ m fucked . I need the schedule it allows me to keep . I only have to teach 5 hours a week . That ’ s just 5 hours that I have to pull myself together and be in front of people . I can do that . The rest is reading and writing . I can do that in spurts , I can do that still up at 5am , I can do that with all the irregularity necessitated by my condition . I could not hold a 40hr/week job . I am simply not capable of functioning for 8 hours in a row , much less 8 hours in a row 5 days a week . I have to lie down multiple times a day , because my head is too noisy . I have to lie down , and wait for the voices to quiet . Do you know what it ’ s like to be told you have to drill holes in your head ? When you ’ re being told that , you can ’ t do anything else in the moment . You just have to wait it out . I ’ m smart , I ’ m capable , I ’ m determined . But I ’ m not consistent—I ’ m literally incapable of that . That ’ s why I lie down all the time . That ’ s why I miss appointments . That ’ s why you hear me telling the walls to shut the fuck up . I just want you to understand that . That ’ s why I ’ m tired all the damn time . I just want you to know that I ’ m not okay . I want you to know that while I ’ m not okay , I ’ m still okay . <newline> <newline> My measure of okay is pretty poor these days . I ’ m not about to kill myself , so I ’ m okay . I hope to be a better okay one day . In the meantime , I hope this helps you know why I do the things I do , why I have to know if the birds are real . <newline>

5,"Dear K , <newline> <newline> Quite frankly , I do n't know what the hell to write . To say I could care less about you at all is a fucking lie , but to say I want anything to do with you is far from the truth . I guess what I am trying to say is I wish all memories of you would cease to exist and I still , even after 3 years , wish you just the worst . Am I a little bitter , well , I guess you could say that . We had it all after all . We were young , doing damn well in life , and had such high hopes . You just got your Surgical Technician job you loved so much and I , well , we know I was never meant to be anything . I may not have had much in life going for me , but you know I was never stupid either . <newline> <newline> <newline> Do you remember ? We were literally the best of friends . Knew each other in high school and everything . It took so much convincing that we should try and date . You knew you wanted to , but were scared . I do n't blame you . We were just so damn great together . I guess it goes as the old saying , `` The candle that burns twice as bright , lasts half as long . '' That was us in a nutshell . After officially dating for only 2 months , I proposed . You know it felt like it was meant to be and we did know each other for much , much longer . It was perfect . Your family loved me and my family literally gave you a home when you did n't have one . We never fought , never questioned each other , full trust and all , but then , everything happened at once ... <newline> <newline> <newline> You were attacked and molested by someone you knew for years . Not even two weeks after your grandmother died . You were still in shock from that . I remember you walking into work looking like a shell of a person . It took forever , but when you told me ... . I still do n't have words for it ... . <newline> <newline> <newline> It changed you ... <newline> <newline> <newline> Within a week you were getting `` bitchy '' . It was n't you . You always had a temper , but it was n't like this . You started demanding me to stop being so lazy and doing some work around the house . Yeah , I was a manager for a pizza joint and you saved lives , but that is no excuse for saying how I am lazy . We BOTH worked 14 hour jobs standing on our feet . We BOTH were tired . I understood you hated disorganization , but was it too much to ask to let me rest a hour after work , especially since you got home 2 hours before me and did n't do anything yourself ? I digress ... That was n't you . You were lashing out and I knew it . Then it got worse . You started throwing the fact I never moved on with the police job in my face . I was scared of failure . I was the only person to EVER attend any higher form of education and you knew that I worked hard for it . You did push me out of my comfort zone though and I went for it , but failed . Then you mocked me for not being good enough . Why ? That was n't necessary . You always made it clear you wanted to be a Army wife . You never said it , but I saw your taste for men . You romanticized the idea that you would take care of the house while your husband defended everyone . You knew that the police department was the same way . Soon I was n't sure if it was my dream or yours . You hated my job so much , even though I was making 30k a year at the age of 20 with half a degree . Yeah , its pizza , I know ... <newline> <newline> <newline> Then , you had surgery for your hip . Everything calmed down for a bit . I helped you in the bathroom , in the bed , and doing anything else . I slept on the floor because I knew I could hit your wound and hurt you and you were already is so much pain I could n't do that to you . It gets fuzzy from there , because I started drinking . I could n't help it . I was weak and needed a something my buddy Jack could help me with . I drank alone , away from you . I still have that bottle I bought on my 21 birthday that we were supposed to drink on our wedding . Heh , I guess I should have dropped it off for you and him . I do n't quite remember what caused it , but I remember the fight that ended it . You came at me with a knife . You were a mild mannered girl who , while had an attitude , would never do that . I know looking back it was all too much for you . You broke . You were strong for too long . You checked yourself into the psych ward that night . We talked a week later after you started group therapy . They helped you so much . Too much . They blamed me for everything . Said I was n't supportive enough . Even though I literally waited on you hand and foot , left work multiple times which if I was n't who I was , any other manager would have been fired . I know you were feeding them bullshit about us because the things you were telling me were n't adding up . You were passing the blame to me . You told them I was lazy , negative , and everything you hated about yourself . They told you to get away from me . I guess you did n't want help . You wanted to pass the blame because you hated yourself . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Then they offered you drugs . The people in therapy were a worse influence than anything else . You used to hate drugs of all kinds , now here you were smoking pot and lord knows what else . Makeup did n't hide those needle marks dear , I 'm sorry to say . Then finally , I remember the second to last time I talked to you . I was leaving work and was going to drive 30 minutes to see you . I remember hearing you say so clearly after asking you why I could n't ... <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Why ? Its not like we are together ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , is that so ? '' I said as I heard some people in the back . `` Let your drug dealer back there know that you do n't have to fuck him for free drugs now that your his whore . '' <newline> <newline> I do n't regret saying that one bit , writing it made me smile even . You decided that drugs were your escape and with no money after the hospital firing you for your dirty drug test , sleeping with him made it easy . I guess that worked out for the best huh ? Because EXACTLY 9 months and a week later you gave birth to your , whatever that thing is . Boy ? I do n't know , its doomed . If you would have told me the venue , I would have mailed that bottle since I knew that wedding date sounded familiar . <newline> <newline> <newline> After months of self loathing and healing , you decide to call me at work and say what , that because my hands were dry I should use coconut oil because it 's food safe ? I went off on you . I made you cry . You just could n't understand why I was so hostile . You wanted to forget everything and be friends . FUCK THAT . Then you sent your dog on me . Do n't worry sweetie , I told him everything . He was irate , but he still thought he was defending your honor . I told him how I did the same thing to her ex who , in her words , was abusive in many ways . He let it slip that I beat you , and I laughed at him . I told him not only did I never hit you , I did n't even touch you when you had the knife . He said he 'll beat my ass and while i 'm sure you got all riled up and serviced him after he told you that , I promise his burned out ass could n't . I heard he tried for the army , though I 'm not surprised . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Well , that 's about all I know of you , besides facebook keeps telling me to add you . I 'd block you , but I do n't have it in me . This is where I 'm weak . Not a week goes by without thinking of you at least once . I physically shake and get weak if I even think I saw your car . I am terrified to see you in person . I do not think I can handle it . Sometimes it hits and I go into a deep depression for a few hours , other times I smile when I hear of misfortunes in your life . Remember sweetie , its a small town and I played football . I know everyone and everything that happens in a 50 mile radius . I wish you would move north like you wanted so I could stop hearing it , especially from my father , asking why I left you is too much sometimes . I did n't have the heart to tell him you 're a whore . He really loved you like a daughter and showed you more love than he ever showed me . Sometimes , I really wish we could still be friends , but I know if we even got close to good terms , I would beg for that girl I used to know to come back . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I will say , even after all that , I am with someone I love . It is n't the same as when we were together , but I think its for the better . I do n't know what is different , but its not the same . I am happy and I am glad I am with her . I treat her right and she takes care of me . It is the way we used to be . I know that if you ever read this , you would understand and be happy for me . I wish I could be happy for you , but it will never happen . You always were a better person than me . I will never forget you , nor will I ever forgive you . I wish you a lifetime of damnation and misery , while wanting the best . You put yourself in a situation where your husband is your ex dealer and you 're living in section 8 . I am happily in our 3 bedroom house with two new cars . I 'm not saying that would be us if we were together , but I am saying you would be better off . <newline> <newline> <newline> I want you to know , you 're the reason I ca n't propose again . I have this damn ring that I want so desperately to give her , but ca n't . You broke me . I ca n't even allow anyone to get that close to me again . I have n't cried or felt sadness for anyone or anything in years , because I know nothing can affect me as much as that did . I have a million emotions going through me right now and so much more to say . Much , much more . I will save it for if we ever meet again I suppose . <newline> I pray that does n't happen . I hope writing this down helps me move on , because it is becoming a burden I ca n't carry . Finally , there really is n't any other way I can end this letter that is appropriate unless I use this word ... .. <newline> <newline> <newline> Love , <newline> J . <newline> <newline> <newline>

5,"For the record , this is what you did . <newline> <newline> It was Thursday , September 10 , 2015 . The air was heavy with mist because it had just rained , and as I rounded my corner I saw you standing outside the bodega . I didn ’ t even want to look at you because I was so disgusted at what I was learning about you from your associates on the street : the cheating , the prostitutes , the dust smoking , all the money you owed to your suppliers , the real reason you got jumped . <newline> <newline> My apartment looked like a junkie lived there : The floor was dirty and the table was sprinkled with your angel dust-treated tobacco and crumbs of the weed you just bagged up . It was clear you were dusted all the time now . For the last four months I ’ d let you use my place to bag up your dime bags , shower and change clothes , and fuck me occasionally . Now I wanted you out but I had no idea how to do it . Your clothes sat in piles on the floor next to papers and pens and lighters—the detritus that made up your life . It had been there since your son ’ s mother sent it over in black garbage bags 5 days ago , when she found out you had a closet at my place that looked exactly like the one she had at hers in the Bronx . That was the same day I found out you two hadn ’ t actually broken up . You blamed me for all of it and raged at me incessantly . It turns out that beneath your charming , humble , gentle giant , Furious Styles-esque exterior , you were a Jekyll-and-Hyde , wifebeating sociopath . *That* was a rude awakening . <newline> <newline> It was early , like 9:30 . You came in and made a beeline for the bedroom , and in minutes I heard you snoring . I was exhausted so I turned off the light , curled up on the couch and tried to fall asleep . <newline> <newline> “ What are you doing out here ? Come to bed. ” <newline> <newline> “ You must be joking. ” I told you a little about the shit I was learning . “ There is nothing between us anymore. ” <newline> <newline> “ Nothing between us ? Why you doing this , man ? ” <newline> <newline> How could you not see my disgust ? The night before I ’ d learned that you beat your son ’ s mother , and your ex-girlfriend before that—as well as their children . I was horrified and vowed to never let you touch me again . I didn ’ t want to reward you for being an abuser . <newline> <newline> “ Can ’ t you call up one of your little skanks and fuck them instead ? ” I asked . <newline> <newline> You turned the light on . “ Why won ’ t you come to bed ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Because of all the places you put your dick. ” <newline> <newline> “ This is some bullllllllshit. ” You started taking my blanket off . “ Stop , ” I said , but you grabbed one of my arms and pulled me up . It barely felt like you were exerting any force . You weren ’ t angry ; you were so calm it threw me . You were all business : This was yours , and you were taking it . I figured that if I faked you out long enough you ’ d fall asleep , and then your buddy—the one who told me to call him if I ever needed help getting you out because he sensed that you ’ d completely lost your mind—would be here in two days . Why make a scene ? It would all be over soon . <newline> <newline> “ Why you doing this , man ? ” you kept saying , and I kept telling you , but you didn ’ t hear me . You made it seem like my not being in bed was ridiculous . I knew this would never end . Just two more days , I told myself . <newline> <newline> “ This is some bullshit , ” you kept saying . <newline> <newline> “ O.K. , O.K . ! ” I said as you led me by my arm . “ I ’ ll be right there. ” I ’ d go , I decided , but on my terms . I followed you into the bedroom . It was dark . You were already under the covers . By even being there , I ’ d already crossed a line in my mind , but it was just to shut you up . I knew you ’ d never leave me alone . *Just two more days . * <newline> <newline> I get under the covers and take the blanket and wrap myself up like a burrito . We lay there for a second and I think you may be asleep . You press your thigh up against me and throw your leg over me and I ’ m like , “ No. ” I start restlessly shifting around to telegraph my annoyance . I lay on my back and stare at the ceiling . You face me and start tugging at my shorts . <newline> <newline> “ Why are your shorts still on ? ” you ask . <newline> <newline> “ Stop it , ” I say , imagining that the sternness in my voice will stop you . You always joked that you 'd never hurt me because I 'm white , and they 'd bury you under the jail . I guess that was your idea of humor , because you do n't seem to care about that now . <newline> <newline> “ Why aren ’ t your shorts coming off ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Seriously , stop. ” I grab the waistband and hold on , but you wriggle them off like it ’ s nothing . Then we wrestle with my underwear , our hands getting tangled up in the waistband like we ’ re playing cat ’ s cradle . I bolt up out of bed— “ Whoa whoa whoa ! ” —and back up against the wall . “ You want rape on your rap sheet , too ? ” It ’ s my nervous attempt at a joke . <newline> <newline> “ Hmph , ” you utter with a self-satisfied smirk . You ’ re right on top of me then , your full 6 feet 4 inches and 260 pounds pressing into me . But not menacingly or anything—you ’ re just there . Like a wall . <newline> <newline> “ O.K. , O.K . ! ” I yell and spin around and lay down in bed . I don ’ t see any other choice . You get on top of me and try to stick your dick in . I can ’ t believe this—I ’ d longed for you to fuck me more than once a week all summer , and here you are , fucking when I want nothing more to do with you . <newline> <newline> I ’ m bone dry . I guess my body can ’ t lie . “ Get the lube , ” you say . I sit up and open my nightstand drawer , even though it ’ s closer to you . “ Put it on , ” you say , and I slather it on you and me , and when I ’ m done I lay back and stare up at you and say , “ I hate you. ” <newline> <newline> “ Shut the fuck up , ” you say . You said “ shut up ” once in awhile when we had sex , kinda muttered it , and it was hot . You also used to say “ don ’ t move ” when we ’ d fuck in missionary and I ’ d go crazy and hook my legs over your shoulders and move myself up and down on your cock , remember ? I used to find it hot that you put me in my place . But now you say it over and over , both phrases , one after the other , and it ’ s not hot . <newline> <newline> “ Shut the fuck up. ” “ Don ’ t move. ” “ Shut the fuck up. ” “ Don ’ t move. ” <newline> <newline> I do something I may never forgive myself for : I consider trying to enjoy it . I remember how hot it was when we first started fucking , how you ’ d move in and out of me and our eyes would meet and we could n't believe we were feeling something so good at the same time . I try to hold onto that memory now , but you ’ re grunting with that dead look in your eyes and bloody drool on your lip and you smell like rust and salt and sunshine and sweat . I know you hate me for ruining your two-women-on-each-side-of-the-bridge fantasy , and that fucking me is about asserting your control . <newline> <newline> I keep drying up and you make me re-slather us with lube . After 15 minutes you lose your erection . You sit up and ask me why you can ’ t get hard , and I say I don ’ t know . You hop off and slam the door behind you . <newline> <newline> My phone ’ s vibrating . Your son ’ s mother is texting me that you texted her that you miss her and you ’ re coming up there and did she want ice cream from the store . I actually feel rejected , which makes me feel ashamed . I didn ’ t want to have sex with you , so how can I possibly feel rejected ? ! But my brain hasn ’ t caught up with what happened yet . <newline> <newline> I follow you out of the bedroom . “ Where are you going ? ” <newline> <newline> “ To the store. ” <newline> <newline> “ In the BRONX ? ” You didn ’ t ask how I knew that . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m in a lot of fucking pain , ” you say and rub your knee . I must have kicked it when I was fighting you off , “ when you were raping me , ” I say . I was surprised I said the “ r ” word , because this is n't something I would 've called the cops about . I knew if I ’ d had a choice , I would *not* have had sex with you that night , but I don ’ t feel “ raped ” in the Afterschool Special sense of the word . The word “ rape ” conjures images of a sudden attack by a stranger . Maybe what happened between us was “ gray rape , ” which is what they call encounters like ours where consent isn ’ t given but the girl is dating the guy and she isn ’ t struggling because she trusts him and doesn ’ t quite believe what ’ s happening . She ’ s not scratching and clawing because she ’ s in utter disbelief . No one pulled me off the street and bent me over and raped me in an alley . But our sex was not consensual . Whatever you call it , it was WRONG . I don ’ t need a jury to tell me that you don ’ t give a fuck about my free will . <newline> <newline> `` YO. ” Your eyes got really wide . “ I did NOT rape you . man . You have to be really careful what you say , it could get misinterpreted by someone and I could get charged. ” It sounded like you had some experience with this . <newline> <newline> “ You can ’ t go up to the Bronx , ” I say . I ’ m not going to let you force yourself on her , too . What you don ’ t want to say is that you want to finish having sex . And finish you did . Without even washing off your dick . If they made Fabreze for vaginas , I ’ d stick a whole can up there . <newline> <newline> “ Bye , honey ! ” I yelled sarcastically once you slammed my front door . I vowed you ’ d never set foot in my apartment again . The next day was Friday , September 11 . I called your buddy and told him tonight was the night . I imagined he ’ d retrieve my keys and take your stuff , but he did a lot more than that . He and his buddies gave you the reckoning you deserved for acting like The Douchebag of Harlem . After he relieved you of your iPhone , your bread and my house keys , everyone took a whack at you until you stood in the street wearing nothing but your boxers . When he told me to come to my living room window and watch , I said no because I couldn ’ t bring myself to look . <newline> <newline> The next morning , when I walked outside and reached the corner and you weren ’ t there , I thought , Good . In less than 12 hours I ’ d gotten justice , and I didn ’ t even have to call the police . There would be no uncomfortable run-ins . And the best part was that I didn ’ t even have to ask for justice . The streets took care of it . <newline> <newline> Seven weeks later you ’ d be back at Rikers , where you ’ ve been for the last two months because she finally had enough of you abusing her in an apartment you never paid a cent to live in . A few weeks later , when one of your street buddies told me about that girl you cornered in a bathroom who said she felt raped , and how she was crying afterward , I realized that it wasn ’ t all in my head . <newline> <newline> This really happened .

5,"Dear me , at 16 . <newline> So ya , all that garbage happen.You did the right thing to tell your mom . You stopped him from touching that little girl.youre not responsible for his sickness . Your life is going by so slow right now but when you look back you will realize just how fast it went by . <newline> <newline> Right now you are scared and tired and worn but to me you are a ghost . A ghost of strength . A poltergeist that follows me every time I 'm faced with a trial and do n't stand up to the sweetness and light you emitted ; even though you should of been entirely broken down . No one could of said anything about if you did break , but you did n't ... and they still did . <newline> <newline> You 're afraid . But you are so pure . Just because he hurt you does n't mean you are tainted . You 're beautiful . You 'll be beautiful next year when all your hair falls out . You 'll be allowed to go to school , in a few years when they ca n't stop you . You 'll do good . You 'll forge a few documents to get in , but you will.And you 'll pass all your tests . His family , they 'll still keep talking about you , but you 'll soar . Im sad to say they will plague you for a long time . You let them beacsue you care so much regardless . <newline> <newline> <newline> You 'll get sicker ... Alot sicker . But one day you 'll look up , and you 'll be o.k . <newline> <newline> There 's no shame in what happen and your not being punished . They are the ones who are wrong.He was the one wrong . Just because someone is related to you does n't mean it 's o.k for them to abuse you . You 're not dirty , you 're not sexually tainted . It will be hard and you will run out of the room when people break the wall holding the tears and despair . <newline> <newline> You will deny the pain the memories . Youll work 70 hours plus a week for the next decade , but heres a little spoiler we are buying our mom and step dad a house in two montha . But you 'll make it . And you 'll learn you do n't need to be approved by anyone but you . <newline> <newline> You 're beautiful . I 'm beautiful . Beauty is what you decide to be and then work toward it . <newline> P.s you get better . Our hair grows back and we help a sick little girl or boy somewhere get beautiful long wavy hair of their own .

5,"Dear Mom , <newline> <newline> I spend a lot of time thinking about our relationship . If I 'm being honest , some days I hate you . Some days I picture you in my head and all I can see is a weak , selfish , and ultimately stupid person and I know that you 're afraid that 's how I feel about you all the time , because you 're very perceptive and you can see it behind my eyes when you start to get drunk . <newline> <newline> I probably have n't told you this , but my first memory is of the first time we left my father , we were in the car . I did n't really understand what was going on , but you had a black eye and you were crying . I told you everything was going to be okay , and you tried to smile and held my hand for a moment . Sometimes when I was still in highschool and living with you , I would think about that moment and how it seemed to completely define all of the bad parts of our life . I always seemed to have to hold YOUR hand and tell YOU everything was going to be okay . <newline> <newline> Eventually you brought Bill into our lives , he was a wonderful father to me and husband to you . For seven years we had a family , and then you left him . I used to think you could n't stand being happy , I ca n't hear the sound of your laughter in my memories . I did n't understand then how it 's possible to fall out of love , to become a different person than you were , I just thought you 'd gotten bored . <newline> <newline> The next few years were hell for both of us , puberty and isolation for me , and you went from someone who usually had to much to drink at parties , to a full on alcoholic . It hurt my heart more than anything to see such a strong intelligent woman drink herself into a coma every night . How could that state of being be acceptable or preferable to anyone ? <newline> <newline> That 's when I truly started to resent you and think you were weak and stupid . I did n't start to think you were selfish until I was older , and you began to leave me home alone for days at a time while you went to Florida or Maine or New York City , with your new boyfriend and the next one , then your fiance . Do you remember that time you left for Florida and I called you because there was no food in the house for me to eat ? It was a Friday and you were n't supposed to be back until Monday . I spent the weekend at my best friends house and his mother fed me . I did n't tell them you were n't around . When you got home and noticed I was n't starving you said `` See ! It was n't so bad after all . '' <newline> <newline> The worst though , was the visits from the police . The time your brother called the cops on you for getting wasted and screaming at him in his house at two in the morning . The time you showed up at 2am driving your car almost too drunk to talk and demanded I call the police because your boyfriend had pushed you down in a parking lot and kicked you , when the police arrived they took your statement and spent more time threatening you about DUI than helping you , the fucking bastards . Or the time in California , when we went to visit my grandmother and you got drunk at the hotel restaurant and I decided to head back to the room early to prevent a scene . Best laid plans of mice and men huh ? We 've never spoken of that one again , I 'm not even sure if you can remember all of what happened . How you burst into my room and screamed in my face about how selfish I was being and how I needed to put aside my issues with you and spend time with my grandmother , how I told you to leave me alone and left walking up the beach in the dark of night sitting in the sand until you came stumbling up the beach and found me in the dark to continue screaming at me . How you pushed me down when I stood up and told me if I could n't get over myself you 'd walk off and never see me again and then the police came and asked me if you 'd hurt me . You had n't , but I almost told them you did just to see you spend the night in a jail cell in a strange state . I did n't though . <newline> <newline> I did n't because , no matter how much I can hate you sometimes , I love you more . You 've done so much for me . So much more effort and cost than most of my other friends parents ever even bothered to try to do with them . You supported me and you actually listened to what I had to say in everything ( except your drinking ) from the day I could talk , because my opinion and my happiness matters to you . I think I started smoking just to spite you , and to try to give myself a better grasp on addiction , it did n't really work , I smoked for a year and quit just like that , but I 'm not you . I have my own flaws . Like dwelling on all the bad memories , the five or six major events interspersed over a good ten years , they stick out in my mind like patches of burned forest from an airplane , but the rest is still there . Without you , I would n't be anything close to the person I am today . <newline> <newline> So anyway , I 've kinda rambled on in this letter , but I 'm about to get to the point because I think this is the part you really need to hear from me . I know you did n't want to read the other stuff , but that part was more for me . I needed to remind you why this next part is so important , for both of us . <newline> <newline> Mom , I forgive you . I love you . I 'm so thankful for every good thing you 've ever done for me and those things far outweigh the bad parts even if I ca n't come right out and list them like the bad ones . <newline> <newline> Your loving son ~thedarkpurpleone

5,"To my ex , <newline> I 'm sorry I 'm being `` bitter '' about this but that video you had the tenacity to post on YouTube and show three thousand people is stinging in the back of my mind . <newline> You were pretty much the reason I realized my sexuality and thus that night I sat there and decided I did n't care if there were thousands of miles between us is one that now fills me with regret . I waited , I never pressured you and I respected you . However when you went on to take me for granted and such that is when I decided not to keep going . I held up for months , trying to ignore the fact that you used me to get people jealous . <newline> We broke up , I sat there for two days fighting with myself and blaming myself . I won you back , but the victory was shortlived when one of your friends had to message me and say you had cheated thrice , both on and offline . That 's what I was waiting for , the reason to leave . I won you back in the hopes it would make you notice . We had the good times , the ones where we would stay up late into the night on Skype just talking about nothing . And now when I look at those photos , and when the date of your birthday and such passes there is still hurt there . <newline> And then of course , as I began to feel better and hate you less ( however not once did I wish anything bad upon you ) you decided to make that video . Act like I was the scum , say I was bitter and such . Maybe I was , maybe I was bitter but maybe that was because I trusted you with something that was hardly there . But that video , the link to it was sent to me at 2am one day . I got through two minutes before I broke down entirely sat down just staring at my screen . When someone that important says such terrible things you snap . And I relapsed . I was hunted by people you gave my skype to , I was told I was a whore and I was told to kill myself . I sat there crying . I had nobody to call , I was alone . But I went and messaged a few of those friends of mine , and they sat there for hours trying to tell me I was better than that . That I was better than you . And for once I had a little belief in myself . <newline> When I passed out , they still sent messages . Saying that I was amazing because I help these people . I tell them that daily because some are suicidal and some have people like you on their backs . That morning is also when they went after you . I never told them to , I was only aware when I went to flag it . They spread that , they helped me . They left those comments saying she was out of line and when you said I was too much of a coward , I went and I told you I was no coward and I was strong enough not to hide behind a computer screen and strong enough not to tell people to stalk them . <newline> I watched the full thing today . After I cut it off I wished nothing bad upon you , and even now I do n't because I am better and stronger . And I have people who care surrounding me and telling me I am amazing . Because I guess I am . <newline> Sincerely <newline> Someone who 's moved on

5,"To My Wife of 13 years ; the letter I wish I could send you instead of continuing to live this lie . <newline> <newline> I 've no idea how to properly express the way I 've been feeling lately , so I apologise now if this comes across as a ramble , with no real explanation for anything . Truth is , I do n't know if I actually have any explanation . <newline> <newline> First of all , let me say I love you . I love you to bits . I never want to see you hurt , and I never want to see you suffer . The thing is , I just do n't know if I am actually in love anymore . The past few weeks have been great , do n't get me wrong , but I still have this emptiness inside that I ca n't shake off . <newline> <newline> When we 're together , and I can see you 're happy , it makes me happy . When I see you 're sad , it makes me sad . You know I 'm still attracted to you , but despite that ... I do n't know . There 's just something that is n't there anymore . The only way I can describe it is I am numb to things . Suggestions are made for doing things , and they turn me cold . I find myself sitting there thinking to myself that I do n't want to do this or that , I do n't want to make those plans or go with those arrangements . Like I said above , I love you . I love you dearly and I truly am sorry for how things have gone , and for feeling the need to say what I 've just said ... I just have to be honest . Honest with you , and honest with myself . <newline> <newline> For the past 2-3 years , maybe even longer , I 've felt like I 've been living someone else 's life . I love the kids , and I would n't change having them for the world , but I feel like all I 've become is just a provider , a facilitator even , that allows everyone else to have their own lives and never mind my own . I 've gone with every suggestion , practically bankrupting myself at times . I 've scraped my arse back from the abyss singlehandedly , because no matter what I said or did it was always inferior to what you or anyone else wanted . I am a positive , life-loving individual who can be a bit of an oddball and is a bundle of quirks , but for God knows how long I 've not been that person . I 've been dragged down.. Turned into a huge mess of negativity.. and been made to conform with everyone else 's aspirations & expectations , forsaking my own free will . I 've moved house at your request , and done everything I can for that when my head was telling me it was an unnecessary financial burden given that we were rent/mortgage free before . I did n't just change jobs , I changed careers to try to suit you and to work the hours you preferred . <newline> <newline> I 've been a square peg in a round hole for a long long time , and it is no coincidence that the changes I took it upon myself to make this year are the reason I even have my head straight enough to write this . I took it upon myself to apply for a scholarship to Uni , and I achieved it . 100 % funded degree course . No support from you though . No help . I took it upon myself with no support to seek first informal help , & then to progress to full blown counselling for how I was feeling at my lowest , & after some very tough times I 've begun to emerge again . Reconnecting with friends , & reigniting old interests is another step , & I 've done that alone too . <newline> <newline> I guess what I 'm trying to say here is that I 'm done . All the negativity , all the bullshit , all the pretence of being someone I 'm not . I 'm done . I have single handedly gotten myself facing the right way again after being upside down , inside out and back to front , and now I am ready to take strides to enjoy myself again . The kids will always be the most important thing to me , and I will always be there for them as best I can be . I will always love you , and I will always hold a place in my heart for you as the mother of my children , but I am now at a stage where I think we 've just grown too far apart , have different goals , different ideals now . You still clamour for that `` forces lifestyle '' , and talk about `` standards '' , `` routine '' , and `` structure '' . That 's not me . It never has been . I 'm a free spirit , an adventurer , and a damn good actor for being able to surprises that . Do n't get me wrong I can write a list or two , and I can create structure & stability to accomplish things , but I ca n't live my life that way . <newline> <newline> I 'm a square peg , and you 're a round hole . It 's time we both found a better fit . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> <newline> Your Husband

5,"Dear Katie , <newline> <newline> It feels strange to be sitting here writing this to you . Especially in the form of a letter , emails seem to be a way of life , but I have to say that watching my pen move over this page has a certain draw . <newline> <newline> I never thought I would need to write a letter to you . In my mind you should be right here with me . If I close my eyes I can imagine that you 're right beside me , our shoulders touching while we hold hands and enjoy each other 's company . <newline> <newline> Even in my imagination my hands are a bit sweaty , but you 've always made me nervous Katie . I remember you used to worry about that , you would say `` just be your self . I 'll love you anyway . '' I 'm not sure I ever convinced you that I was being myself , the nervousness could n't be helped . I could n't stand the idea of hurting or disappointing you . Lot of good that does me now . <newline> <newline> It took weeks to write this . Seeing your smiling face in my mind and sometimes barely remembering your voice hurt too much . When the pain was all I knew you were my life raft in the ocean . Now I just have to drown until the waters subside . <newline> <newline> Know that I do n't blame you , special . Remember when I called you that all the time ? Anyway , I really do n't . Everything was always intense between us . Amazing highs and amazing lows . I 'm so glad you found someone that makes you happy . I used to tell you that as long as you were happy I would be as well . That 's at least somewhat true . <newline> <newline> I 'll never date again , people tell me never is a long time but it 's not the same . Who knew I would be a one woman man ? But I am and I found and lost the only woman I 'll ever want . Ever . <newline> <newline> This could ramble on for a long time so I 'll wrap things up . Know that I still love you , I never stopped . I do n't blame you for moving on . It sounds ridiculous but sometimes I hold out hope that our story is n't over . That somewhere down the line you 'll love me again . Hah , pathetic . Be safe special . <newline> <newline> P.S . I recently lost and then found the bracelet you made me senior year . It does n't fit anymore so it stays around the gear shift in my car . Love you always , Alex .

5,"Dear Lauren , <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> You 're a good person , sure , but you suck as a mother . You claim that you know how to raise kids , but two of your kids are in jail and more are heading there . You claim you know how to deal with childhood issues , but whenever i cut myself it was always me trying to manipulate you . Whenever i needed therapy , you would get a therapist that would break confidentiality laws and tell you everything . I do not love you , and i do not see a reason to . You do n't pay any attention to my anxiety , saying once again it is manipulation of lies , but your own sons have anxiety and you show utter care to them . You do n't care about my pain , as evident by a weekend of screaming pain from me only to be told by everyone to 'shut up ' . That monday i went to school and was still in extreme pain , tooth pain hurts you know . You do n't care about my feelings , as evident by you repeatedly stating that people who lack God are faking emotions . You call me a satanist when in reality i do not believe in satan , because he 's not real , you 're the one to actually think he exists . You are not a nice lady , you do not deserve my respect just because you 're common law married to my dad . I have noticed that you 've calmed down a lot , which is a first , since we moved into our new house . Thats good , but at the same time , you stated that i have calmed down . I 've been nothing but calm for the past 3 years when dealing with you , even when you freak out over nothing , making up lies , then accusing me of lying myself . You are not a nice lady . You tell your kids `` Come hell or high water '' but you would rather quench your thirst rather than put me out if i were ablaze . You claim i am fine , but yourself is not . Sure , you had physical abuse for a while , but i was MANIPULATED from birth until age 10 , and that needed to be undone . You bring up that situation often , using it to attack my emotions that you claim do not exist . How would you feel if i brought up your previous marriage ? You 'd get your children rallied together and bring forth the hatred of a thousand cunts . You say i need to stop telling people things that go on in our house , but how else am i to vent ? You talk to all the therapists and over-exaggerate to no end , so i need to tell someone something . You are a hypocrite , a narcissistic cunt , and when you die your kids will be sad because of the death - Stockholm syndrome - grip you have on them , and i will be free to actually live peacefully and speak to my dad openly . Just because my birth brother sexually molested me , and your son , does n't mean i will molest anyone . Stop the assumptions and comparisons to him . Show me some sympathy , show me some love , and maybe , just maybe , when you get cancer and die i will be a little less fine with it . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> You 're a megasaurusCunt , <newline> <newline> FDBS <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> PS : I changed my mind , you 're not a good person . Not a good person to me . <newline>

5,"Dear `` Mom '' , You 're a bitch . A stupid , horrible bitch who will never get your head out of your ass and realize that the world does n't revolve around you , that you have no right to control the world and those around you , and that you are foolishly ignorant . I hope you die as lonely and worthless as you made me feel throughout my childhood . Parents are supposed to love and support their children , but even though you paraded the fact that you chose to become my mother and held it over me everytime you disliked what I was doing , you never even treated me with love the way you did your actual children . You could n't let me develop my own interests or personality without poisoning every bit of it . Without telling me how horrible I was or about how I was just deliberately insulting you if I ever had a slightly different opinion . You verbally and emotionally abused me , and my siblings . You gaslighted me and had me so messed up I could n't make decisions as an adult and it took me years to understand that I 'm not a horrible person and that I do have , in fact , a lot of worth and potential in this world . I have gone farther in my five years of independence then you ever will . I 've already traveled to multiple countries around the world . In six months , I will be the first one in either your or dad 's side of the family to get a college degree , despite the fact that you always told me I was stupid and lazy and that [ Brother ] would graduate before I did , despite being four years younger than me . When I get a job after the next degree , I will make a lot more than you ever will , and the work I do will reach more lives for the better than you could . Even on my worst days , when depression takes on your voice , I will always be able to say that I have made it farther than you condemned me . As I said , I hope you die as lonely as you made me feel me entire childhood . I could not be petty and forgive you . But if I forgive you , it lessens the sting , and when I let that happen , I 'm more willing to open myself back up to you and you hurt me every time . So do n't come crying to me when you find yourself all alone or in a spiteful marriage after all of your children have left and my poor dad is the only one left that you can control and he does n't want to put up with it . Just fuck you , bitch . -Me .

5,"Dear Katie , <newline> <newline> It 's been 2 months and 10 days since we started dating , 2 weeks and 5 days since we broke up , and two days since you gave me your letter to me . <newline> <newline> I was hurt by what you said to me and those wounds are still there . Your words cut into the insecurities that I hid from everyone , and yet somehow without me telling you , you just knew them and hit me there . I know we were n't working out . I just did n't expect you to be the one I was going to be so hurt by . I thought we could just end amicably but you had other plans . <newline> <newline> I never understood why two people who used to love each other could end up hurting and hating the other so much . I saw it in people 's divorces and in the media but it just had no emotional grounding for me . Something talked about but never experienced . Yet , now I know and I wish I never did . I do n't hate you but I ca n't be around you ever again . <newline> <newline> I forgave you after reading your letter , the fact that you regretted saying what you said , that you 're sleepless , and that you think I deserve better than you . Part of me believes it and part of me ca n't , at least that last part . <newline> <newline> I forgave you because it was the right thing to do . I did it because even if you hurt me in a way no other human alive has , I still ca n't help but want to make sure you are okay , and I know that the only way you 'll forgive yourself is I forgive you . I 'm a bit fucked up now from this , I just do n't feel like I want to get close to someone like this because the low after climbing to great heights with you is even worse than having never experienced it at all . <newline> <newline> I do n't know what the future will bring . For now though I 'm going to move on . If anything the cold logical objective side of me you hated ( because it said some boneheaded but correct things to you ) is carrying me through . I ca n't change who I am for you , but as you said , `` You 're going to find someone worth being with who treats you the way you deserve and appreciates all the little things about you that I was too self involved to see . '' <newline> <newline> In a way you 've set me free and that 's all I needed to hear from you . You 'll always have a special place in my life and for that I 'm grateful . <newline> <newline> Yours , <newline> <newline> Michael

5,"Dear Jared , <newline> <newline> I remember when I first met you . My mom was picking me up from school and you were on the passenger side . I was just a little girl . I also remember when I looked up to see you at the foot of my bed , watching me masturbate and threatening to tell my mom what I was doing . <newline> <newline> I want to thank you . If it were n't for you , I wouldnt be where I am today . Remember what you once told me ? You told me this would make me grow . And by this , I mean you sliding your hand up my knee every now and again and shoving my sister 's face into the cat 's litter box . Yeah , I sure did grow into a nice , happy woman . <newline> <newline> Remember the time I watched you drag my mom by the hair from your bedroom to the living room , only to pee on her and beat the shit out of her ? Thankfully you only gave her a bald spot and a black eye this time , instead of putting her in a wheelchair like you did the next time . Remember the time you threw the house keys into the thorn bush and making me crawl into it to retrieve them ? I remember that . <newline> <newline> Silence was the only thing that made me feel safe from you . I never spoke , which is why I think you hit me less than the others . There was only one time , though , when you requested silence from me . You came into my bedroom that one night and brought your pointer finger to your lips . It was all over after that . <newline> <newline> I used to hate blaming people for things , especially for my emotions . I sincerely blame you for everything , though . I can not have a healthy sex life now without requesting to be abused ; pain is what I 'm used to now . I blame you for the state you put my mother in . She will never have a sane relationship again . I blame you for my sisters trauma . I blame you for my nightmares . I fucking watched you tear my mom apart , you sick fuck . <newline> <newline> But most of all , I blame you for who I am today . I have developed into a smart , successful , young woman . I am well educated and finally understand who I am . I am no longer suicidal and am no longer upset . I will always think about what would have happened if my mom never met you , but then I do n't think I would appreciate sanity and security as much . Ever since you left , I have never felt more safe . <newline> <newline> But in all seriousness , fuck you . <newline> <newline> itriedeverything

5,"My dearest Mom and Dad , <newline> <newline> Hi . I have problems . I know for a fact I do , and I 'm sure you see it , too . Please do n't think this is just a phase , I 've felt this way for as long as I can remember . I 'm too scared to tell you in person , but please hear me out . <newline> <newline> You know how I always love to look through the Pyramid Collection magazine and look at all the pretty dresses ? It 's not because I want to be a fashion designer , oh no , it 's not that . I look at those pages in envy , in jealousy , knowing I ca n't wear those dresses because `` boys are n't supposed to wear dresses . '' I know this , but I ca n't help but really want to wear one , one day , but I ca n't . <newline> <newline> You gave me that name , `` Steve '' , but I hate it . I hate being called that . Everyone always picks on me for being girly , for liking the things the other girls do . `` Steve , are you gay or something ? '' they ask . `` Well yeah , but ... '' and I ca n't tell them the rest . I 'm scared I 'll be made fun of and the bullies will probably hit me more if I said anything . <newline> <newline> I suppose you wonder why I lash out so much . All these feelings I have , I bottle them up and they 've made me bitter , resentful at the world . I do n't know how to describe how I feel very well , but I can tell you being born a boy feels like a huge mistake . I should n't be this way , but I am . <newline> <newline> Please , I beg of you , please send me to therapy , get me help , please please *please* help me . These feelings are absolutely tearing me up , I do n't know how much more of this I can take . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> Your 12 year old ( daughter ? son ? ) <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> Yes , this is a letter from my 12 year old self to my parents about me being transgender , I just did n't know the word for it at the time . <newline> <newline> In case you 're wondering , this would have been 10 years ago , and I sent myself to therapy a few years ago with the earnings I made working at a grocery store . And yes , it was totally worth it . I 'm on hormones now ( or , as I like to call them , `` titty skittles '' ) and am living a much more fulfilling life : )
"
5,"To my 18 year old self , <newline> <newline> You 've got nothing to regret . I know you do n't believe me , and it is me , but if you do n't make mistakes how to do you know what is correct ? You wo n't know what I am talking about until you get there and then to here . You are going to be terrified of the world you find yourself in and you are n't going to want to live sometimes . You are going to hate everything and hate yourself for it . And you are going to cry . <newline> <newline> I do n't mean to scare you . I do n't want hurt you . But you are going to be hurt , by yourself , by others , but mostly by yourself . And he 's not pleasant . He is vindictive and some of the things he is going to do will shock , surprise and sicken you . <newline> <newline> You will learn that he does n't want you to be him and that there seems like nothing he could do to stop himself . Just keep going . He is you and he is me . He is more scared of himself than anything else . Even the fear of failure and depression that is going to plague him . He does n't know what he is doing to himself , and eventually to you . <newline> <newline> I want to tell you this because I wish someone did . I wish someone had given me a heads up that life can get much worse . Worse than you ever thought and the worst part is that , outside of your head , life is okay and actually has the capacity to be good . It takes some time of being him to learn what I am telling you . I 'm not telling you this so that you can prevent it . <newline> <newline> You ca n't . <newline> <newline> You can only learn to see it coming and do your best to minimize the frustration . You will learn that you need to have a release valve for him . You are going to live with your depression for the rest of your life , but as I sit here crying because I wish you did n't have to go through this , I know somethings can be okay sometimes . And it 's enough to get to keep moving . Hopefully , Forward . <newline> <newline> I do n't actually have advice because you wo n't listen to it just like I did n't and I still have a problem with doing now . I just want to say I love you , and you at least deserve to love yourself even though he is frustrating . Only do your best to remember that and when you ca n't love yourself , take him for a run . He seems to feel much better after that . <newline> <newline> I love you , <newline> Your Future Self

5,"Dear JP , <newline> <newline> <newline> I love you , dude . We 've known each other almost 4 years , been gym buddies for 3 and a half of those years , and I feel for you about 2 years ago . The only reason I still go to the gym even is because I get to spend time with you there . I wish you 'd be more interested in going to do other stuff but I understand how busy your schedule is right now , and I know it 's so you can get to bigger and better things in the future , and I 'm so happy for everything you 've accomplished and how well you 're doing . <newline> <newline> I wish I could tell you that I love you , but I have no clue what that would do . I enjoy being around you too much to change anything , and while rationally thinking I think that you would n't do anything if I told you , the scared little part of my heart that holds the What If ca n't handle it , and it hurts . <newline> <newline> 16 times . 16 times I 've cried because I 've been so scared of maybe losing being able to hang out with you . Go to the gym . Grab a beer . Hell , just study together even . Writing this letter may make it 17 . <newline> <newline> And soon , this possibility may become a reality , dude . I graduate in a year . Who the hell knows where I 'm going after that ? If I ca n't find a way to stay here and I have to leave , I have no idea what I 'll do . Will I tell you ? Will I take it with me ? I have no clue . I 'm just so uncertain about all of this . <newline> <newline> The one thing I 'm certain of , is that even if we were to go our separate ways and it ends badly , I just want you to be happy . I want you to have the best life you possible can , even if I 'm not in it . You 've worked so hard and dealt with so much that you deserve the loving wife and kids , the black and white border collie named penguin you 've talked about , the charming house with the white picket fence . I want you to get all of this , even if I 'm no longer in the picture of your life . I do n't think I 'd ever be able to hate you . <newline> <newline> I know there 's no chance of an Us . I just want there to be an us . If hanging out as the friend , gym buddy , occasional drinking partner , and wing man is all we can be , then I can be happy with that . I just want you to know and accept . <newline> <newline> 17 times .

5,"You , <newline> <newline> I think about you all the time . I know at this point , the gap between us is immeasurable , we 've both grown up into young adults and there 's no telling who you are now . Part of me desperately wants to get to know the young man you 've become since we last spoke . The majority of me is too scared to reconnect , for fear of disappointment . For me you were always possibilities , endless , optimistic , entertaining and full of life . I know it took too long for me to understand , and I know there was nothing I could have done to help or prevent it . You just have to understand , even though we met when I was nine and you were ten , from the very first day I met you I saw your potential . You have a natural wit about you , and your charm is n't bound by your thinking process . People say that doing drugs and drinking during your formative years damages your brain profoundly . I 'm inclined to believe them . I 've never been to medical school , I would n't know . Although you and I probably lost a lot of brain cells all those nights , sneaking out and getting high and kissing to see what it felt like , I want you to understand that i think your wit and your charm and all your talents are still there . I hope in the years since we last met , you 've realized that , and you 're using them to the best of your abilities . I hope you 're in school , or at work , whichever you prefer . I hope that you 're making a name for yourself , even if it 's just among your group of friends . I have rather optimistically assumed , over the past couple years , that you are doing well . That you have learned from our mistakes , in a way that has helped you grow . If you have n't yet gotten over that hump , if you still feel like a brain damaged beer junkie , just know that I have faith in you . Not to get too cheesy , because I know you hate getting sentimental , but there 's always been something about you that makes me confident in your abilities . There 's a strange precognition , call it naive faith or a whisk of fate , that assures me that you were always destined to be a successful , happy adult . <newline> <newline> I guess all of this is to say that I forgive you . We fucked up , big time . I 'm not sure how it affected you , and I 'm not sure you 're interested in hearing how it affected me . I 'm healing , I 'm growing , I can see the light at the end of the tunnel . I hope you can too . There 's a part of me that will always love you . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> Me

5,"Dear Joyce , <newline> <newline> While the last three years , I have enjoyed getting to know you I have to ask , what was the purpose of it all . You connived and manipulated me from the very beginning , and for what ? Oh that 's right you got bored . <newline> <newline> Boredom it seems is a useful tool to use to do things we would not otherwise do . I myself got bored one day and started writing poems , and I fell to enjoy it . But you chose to spend your time figuring out how to become what I lovingly refer to as a succubus . <newline> While I do not believe I have ever called that to you to your face . That is how I view you . You spend all your time planning and playing with men 's emotions for fun . Why ? Because of your `` daddy issues . '' Which by the way I call complete bullshit on ; I have actually come to agree with your dad that you are a self-absorbed and greedy person . I just wish I had seen it at first . <newline> <newline> I once never understood why a man could fall for such a serpent . But now I see , just like eve fell for the lies of the serpent in the garden so had I fallen for you . Do not think these words are written in anger or hate . To be frank this letter is written in joy that you are no longer in my life . You , a person I had bought my first engagement ring for , a person I once saw as an equal are beneath me . While you spend your days plaguing unsuspecting men with your wiles and flirtatious manners , I will be far away from you . Enjoying life , enjoying people who appreciate me , rather than simply draining the essence of my life away and feed themselves upon the work I do to provide happiness . <newline> <newline> I will say one good thing about you - you are a true artist , both with a pen , brush and the lies you concoct ! I rejoice for your future children , it shall be so easy to them become politicians . For your lies will teach them how to manipulate all those around them at a very early age . I 'm actually a little jealous of their skill . <newline> <newline> You are just like your mother - which you of course will take as a compliment , but there is a reason she has been married three times . Or is it four ? I honestly do n't remember , and personally do n't care . <newline> <newline> Goodbye Joyce , I wish the pain on your such as the pain you caused me , I wish that you fail at everything you do . I wish greatly that all men see you as the whore of Babylon that you truly are . But most of all , I wish you never find happiness .

5,"Dear Bill , <newline> <newline> It took a lot of time for me to realize what you are , and now that I do I ca n't seem to think of words that describe how I feel about you being in my life . <newline> <newline> Did you know that , growing up , other kids do n't periodically put their dogs in the freezer for fun ? Or spend countless hours drowning mice in the basement ? It 's amazing Mom and Dad never found out about you , especially after you killed the McInley 's cat . <newline> <newline> I used to wonder why throughout school we never had really close friends . I mean obviously we had friends , more than most kids , but they were never close friends . It was the same thing with girlfriends . I consistently thought there was something wrong with me , and I guess there was : you . You manipulated everyone to feed your unhealthy obsession with us , and kept me emotionally isolated so I would n't get in your way . <newline> <newline> As we 've grown older we 've grown apart and I thought I was rid of you after basic , but that was just another part of your scheme . What better place could there be for you to thrive than the military , and you used me to get you through the training . That was a mistake however , as it has made me just capable enough to cut you off from the people you wo n't even let me love . I 'm going to do it Bill , and you ca n't stop me . <newline> <newline> Dear Mom and Dad , I 'm sorry for having been so cold . I thought I hated you , and maybe I do , but I 'd like to think it was just Bill 's influence . I wish I could say I love you but if I did , none of this would be necessary . All I can say is crack on , and focus on Chloe and Jake . <newline> <newline> I think I 've found the words , Bill . I fundamentally despise you . I hate you in an intimate way that most other people do n't understand . Most other people do n't have the relationship we do . It 's because of you that I 'll never be able to have a normal life , with other people . It 's your arrogant and insecure thoughts that influence every decision I make . It 's your fault that I do n't feel a connection to other people . I 've done my research and there 's no treatment for you , only pretending to be normal . But I do n't take pleasure in a facade like you , and I 'm not so self centred as to drag this despairing monologue out further . If you will force me into a future of self-loathing , fear , and alienation ... if you take my future from me , then I 'll do the same to you . <newline> <newline> Here 's to you , asshole .

5,"Honey . <newline> <newline> Oh honey . How did we do this , in the first place ? How did we get to here , no contact . This is the third month . It 's not really no contact , because I still think you are n't dead . You 're not , but I forced myself to believe that . <newline> <newline> You 've missed out on a lot , honey . I grew . A lot . <newline> <newline> Honey , we said we did n't want to get feelings for eachother . But here we were , with feelings deep for each other and no way out . <newline> <newline> Oh honey I saw how it hurt you . You snapped . You realised that you had to leave , quit this bullshit and return a year later , a `` new person '' . <newline> <newline> Which probably was the moment you realised when 'Wait , what is this feeling I get when she says things in MY chest omg is this what people call love ? '' no , probably hypertension , get it checked . <newline> <newline> You moved house . <newline> <newline> Honey , when you come back , I want to take you out . I did n't think I was toxic for you . Physical contact was , I know ... ( hilarious that , when we first started you got terribly ill , and eventually we got there . ) <newline> <newline> <newline> Honey if my relationship allowed me to , I 'd be your Miss for you . I 'd allow you to snuggle in with me , hug me , and be with the strong one . Be loved , not tolerated . <newline> <newline> I miss your touch . Your perpetually cold hands . Beards that grow like fire after a day . Tummy hair . I still feel it . <newline> <newline> There is still things that remind me of you . Today I realised that WheezyWaiter reminded me of you , and I could n't watch . <newline> <newline> Muffin scratched my head and I started bawling . There is little stuff like that that sets me off . <newline> <newline> I just want to know what your feelings are . You know mine . I love you . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> You could tell that by the messages I sent . I tried to get a response . I really did . Everything was tried . Seriously , the Adele joke was tried , and the 'easy dig ' jokes were n't dug at . <newline> <newline> H , please . You might read it . I doubt it , writing prompts were n't your thing . But on the 0.000001 % chance , TEXT THE BLOODY GIRL YOU WERE AVOIDING , SHE KNOWS YOU 'RE NOT DEAD , SHE HAS THE SAME TEXT CLIENT TO YOU . Remember how she made you feel ? <newline> <newline> <newline> Good . <newline> <newline> With love ; the girl who took you and loved you like only she could . <newline> <newline> ( she 'll be impressed if you have a girlfriend , next year . )

5,"Dear mom and dad , <newline> <newline> <newline> I have something to tell you that I ’ ve wanted to tell you for a while now but have been afraid too . I met a man and we fell in love . He is great guy , has a good job and family and treats me like I ’ m the most important person in his world . <newline> <newline> Dad , he reminds me a lot of you . He takes care of me and makes me feel safe and loved just like you do . Does the fact that he works too hard and usually forgets to take a break to eat or sleep remind you of anyone ? <newline> <newline> Mom you ’ ll be happy to know that you have someone to commiserate with over my lack of organizational skills . It bothers him as much as it bothers you that I don ’ t put things away where they belong and then run around like a crazy person trying to find them the next time I need them . You both glare at me while handing me whatever I happen to be looking for and tell me to learn to put it away . Most importantly mom , he makes me feel like dad makes you feel . <newline> <newline> We ’ ve been together for a year now . A year in which I ’ ve lied to you about where I am and who I am with . You know about him but you don ’ t know who he is to me . To you he is just a friend but to me , he ’ s it . I ’ ve hated lying to you but we all know that as soon as I tell you about him , it ’ ll be treated as world war three . <newline> <newline> My entire life you ’ ve made it clear that you expect me to have a arranged married , just like the two of you did . You told me how arranged marriges aren ’ t what they used to be and that I would have a choice and a chance to get to know the person before we got married . I accepted that and never even bothered to look at a guy as more than a friend . <newline> <newline> That changed the day that I met him . Without really knowing how or even wanting to , I fell in love with him . Now I ’ m stuck at this crossroads . On one side is him and what I know will be a life full of happiness . On the other side are the both of you and the deep hurt I will cause you if I tell you about him . <newline> <newline> I don ’ t know what to do and I am afraid that one way or another , the decision is going to made for me soon . I love him but I love you both too . <newline> <newline> Now I just have to figure out what to do . <newline> <newline> Love , <newline> <newline> Your daughter . <newline>

5,"Dear E , <newline> <newline> I love you . Not the cheesy love I felt in high school , and not the way I love the woman I think I 'm going to marry , but you hold a place in my heart that no one else can . <newline> <newline> We were destructive . We were n't good for each other . You were emotionally abusive , and I was amazed a pretty girl would give me the time of day . I was putty in your hands , and you took advantage of that to the fullest . I had my faults too , but you put the nail in the coffin . <newline> <newline> Then you got kicked out of school . You moved in with another guy and confided in me about your relationship problems . I , a guy who cares too much and tries too hard , was more than willing to stay up until the wee hours listening to you and solving the problems of a relationship I had no part in . We might have been a thunderstorm , but he was a hurricane . You kept seeing him , and kept coming to me for advice . I conceded . <newline> <newline> <newline> Then the accident happened . <newline> <newline> You were going too fast . You hit a puddle . You could n't keep from swerving into the other lane . You survived , but not without some brain damage . <newline> <newline> I remember speeding to the hospital and seeing him . The man who was the vehicle to this lifestyle that put you here . <newline> <newline> The man whose smile was as crooked as your front bumper when I saw your car in the junkyard . It was the first time I recall feeling genuine hate . The first time I wanted someone to die . To change places with you . <newline> <newline> The next few months you 'll never remember . You were in a coma . You were in rehab . You could n't speak . You could n't eat . I was there every other day , spending hours with you , watching movies with the husk of a person I once knew . <newline> <newline> But you improved . Your brain damage was n't as bad as they thought , but it changed you . You became frustrated . You would lash out at me due to your brain 's lack of ability to filter . You 'd hit me . I remained there . I taught you to count again . I taught you colors . I taught you the parts of your face . I fed you your first solid meal . <newline> <newline> Then college came . Then I realized that things would never be the same . That as much as I cared for you , I had to move on , and so did you . You were recovered to the best that you would be , and you were moving out on your own . <newline> <newline> You have a baby now . You have a boyfriend . I have a woman by my side who I love dearly . There 's no trace of romantic feelings whatsoever , but I 'll always remember our time together . I 'll always care for you deeply . You 'll always be the one who taught me what caring for people really means . <newline> <newline> <newline> You 'll never remember what I did . You 'll never remember learning colors or numbers or eating your first meal from a spoon I was holding . <newline> <newline> I think I like it better that way . <newline> <newline> <newline> We were a thunderstorm , but the skies are clear now . <newline> <newline> <newline>

5,"Dear Mom and Dad , <newline> <newline> Remember when you brought me home from the hospital ? <newline> <newline> When you held me in your arms for the first time ? <newline> <newline> When I drew you pictures of cats , that you proudly displayed ? <newline> <newline> When I cried when you dropped me off at daycare for the first time ? <newline> <newline> When I would phone you in the middle of the night at sleepovers , crying and telling how much I missed you ? <newline> <newline> When we sang along to Dolly Parton on long road trips ? <newline> <newline> When we made blanket forts in the living room ? <newline> <newline> When you got me a spray bottle for the monsters under my bed , and filled it with water and some scents so I thought you helped me escape the evil creatures ? <newline> <newline> When I played at my first piano recital ? Band concert ? Symphony concert ? <newline> <newline> Mom and Dad , do you remember these ? <newline> <newline> Because I recall you , Dad , being in and out of jail . You throwing my favorite Disney cups against the wall in a drunken rage , shattering my heart along with them . <newline> <newline> I recall you both telling me , `` Not to wear dresses , or play with makeup , because that makes you gay . '' <newline> <newline> I recall you , Dad , physically beating my Mom , because you wanted the money we were going to use for food that week to spend on alcohol . <newline> <newline> I recall you , Mom , missing my concerts , things I held so close to my hear , because you had to work , and could n't be bothered . And you , Dad , missing my concerts because you were too drunk to go . Too drunk to care . <newline> <newline> I recall us sitting at the dinner table , you two discussing how *disgusting* being gay is . I recall you saying , `` How could anyone even begin to think that they were born gay ? God would not create something that disgusting ! '' I recall you both shouting , `` Faggot '' and , `` Go kill yourself '' to the TV whenever a same-sex couple appeared . I recall sitting through an unfathomable amount of rants and hatred filled conversations about how being gay is worse than murder , rape , adultery , and stealing . About how they will not inherit `` God 's Kingdom '' because the very God I 'm supposed to love , hates gay people . `` I hate these faggots ! '' is a phrase I 've heard so often it 's branded onto the outer edge of my eyes as a constant reminder about how you feel about being gay . `` I love you '' is what you said . But if you had known the truth about me , the very existence of my being - then you would know that you do not love me . For you hate gay people . And Mom ? Dad ? <newline> <newline> I 'm gay . <newline> <newline> Love , <newline> Your Son <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

5,"Dear Azura <newline> <newline> You have no idea how much you mean to me . Throughout the years I have known you you have brought me countless joys , you make me smile , you make me laugh , you make me happy . When people bring up perfection you are the first person that comes to mind , even though you do n't believe it yourself . Your eyes . Your face . Your Smile . Your laugh . Your personality . Your Everything . Even your name . Azura . Just saying it is beautiful . Before I met you , I did n't believe in love at first sight . When I saw you , all of that changed - you were the most beautiful , wonderful person I have ever met , and like a fine wine , you only grow better with time . When I am around you , I am at my happiest . When we talk my heart dances to your voice and your laugh , and my eyes get lost in you , and I can truly say I am happy . <newline> <newline> But your love is like a drug . <newline> <newline> When you leave I delve once again into emptiness and loneliness , and nothing can fill the void left in me when you 're not around . When you decide that I 'm not worth your time , I recede into a place where only sadness resides . When you take advantage of my kindness , when you treat me like trash and when you play with my feelings , I feel a sadness that is more powerful than the sadness felt at a lost relative , a failed exam , or a disappointed parent . Yet despite the way you treat me sometimes , I ca n't help but love you . I have tried everything to move on , and yet I am still lost within you , and something tells me I will never be able to find my way out of those eyes . Something tells me , in years to come , when you have forgotten me , I will still be dreaming about what could have been . <newline> <newline> I 'm sorry I 'm not good enough . <newline> <newline> It kills me that I 'm not good enough . That I 'm ugly , awkward and not experienced . It 's not your fault . You deserve perfection nothing less . When you find perfection , and when you forget me , I hope that it lasts , and I hope you find every happiness you have ever wanted . I will be glad when you find the person who completes you , and I know that person will never be me . <newline> <newline> You will forget me . I 'll just be another face , another person you used to know . However , I will never forget you . You will always be in my mind , up until my dying breath , when the world has decided to let me go , in search of one last beautiful sight - I will think of you , and the times we spent together , so that I can smile when death takes me . <newline> <newline> With all of my love , <newline> <newline> Alex .

5,"Dear 14 year old me , <newline> Hi . You 're alive honey ! I know that 's more than you expected to be at this point . I have a couple things I want to tell you . <newline> <newline> 1 . You do get better . That monster that sits on your chest and tells you lies will back off eventually . You 'll be able to eat normally again , I promise . Boys will take you on dinner dates , and you 'll be okay . You can get through this Thanksgiving dinner , and you wo n't be 80 pounds forever . Those girls at youth group will one day come for you with questions about anorexia and you will have the story of recovery . It was so hard , and it still is hard sometimes to make yourself take that bite , but you are alive and happy now . <newline> <newline> 2 . Forgive Amy , then hug her at the homecoming game and never stop hugging her at strange times . Hold on to your best friend for as long as you can . Buy her stuffed ducks from around the world . She 's still just as awesome as she was . <newline> <newline> 3 . Appreciate Austin while he 's still home . You have no clue what 's going on with him right now . So shut your mean 14 year old mouth and hug your brother . ( By the way , you 're going to miss him when he goes to college . ) <newline> <newline> 4 . Your parents have done everything in their power to help you and support you . Tell them you love them and please show dad how to send a text and teach mom how to take a selfie . <newline> <newline> 5 . Go hug grandma . Listen to her music , learn from her life , and look at those old pictures . Appreciate the fact that she is an accepting , progressive , and smart lady- not a common trait found in grandparents . You will wish you could talk to her now so she could see how alike you are . <newline> <newline> 6 . You 're going to fall in love at a school presentation of Les Mis . Yes . That chubby boy with his booming Javert voice is going to be your best friend . Yeah , he IS cute . And yeah , I guess you do have a thing for actors . Now go chase that handsome idiot until he finally catches on . Kiss him at the New Years party when everyone is asleep . Stay up all night and walk down Main Street at sunrise . Break into the golf course and lay under the stars with him when you 're supposed to be at home . Push him down in the snow , hold his hand , make the first move you wonderfully liberated feminist ! Stick with that boy . He is going to hold you through the panic attacks , rub your back while you struggle to eat , paint you with his hand covering your scars , and put up with your wonderfully eccentric dad . <newline> <newline> 7 . Be kind to yourself- to me . I love you and I 'm proud of you .

5,"Dear One-of-Three , <newline> <newline> There were days back in grade school where I came prepared to kill you . My dad ’ s gun weighing down my backpack more than I could admit . Sitting there with awful intentions . I was n't scared of it . I knew how to shoot it and how to handle it . My dad knew I knew of it so he taught me about it in order to get rid of the curiosity that could lead to horrible accidents . He couldn ’ t picture me using it on purpose . <newline> <newline> Almost every day through two school years you and the others taunted me . I became sport for you and your friends . A relentless barrage of creative insults were flung at me before I even sat down on the bus in the morning until the bus pulled far away enough that I could no longer hear you in the afternoon . <newline> You took me to a dark place . A place where no 11 year old should be able to imagine . I could picture you dying in lots of ways . The most satisfying where in a school yard fight . Ones where I would actually fight back and end it with a large enough rock to the face ; repeatedly . Those were the day-dreams that actually made my adrenaline pump while just sitting there . <newline> <newline> I don ’ t know what saved you . It wasn ’ t lack of opportunity . You sat one seat ahead of me on the bus . You liked to be close , me within reach with the back of your head a pretty target . I could picture painting the seat in front of you red with your blood . It wasn ’ t lack of motivation . Only the universe knows how much I wanted to do it . Day dreams of you dying were my favorite . Maybe I just missed that one push with that one perfect opportunity . I carried the gun in my coat pocket during recess . Nothing since then has ever felt as foreign or cold in my hands . I ’ ve worked with guns plenty since then but nothing ever felt more dangerous to me . To think of the nerve I must have had . To get into my dads safe in the morning and take it out . Even tucked away in my bag I felt like I had a big flashing sign above me . And it wasn ’ t just once . Three times in one week I brought it . An 11 year old never had more frayed nerves . <newline> <newline> There is nothing to gain from this letter for me or for you directly . But in the end I didn ’ t do it . I ’ m happy I didn ’ t , obviously . I don ’ t feel the same anymore . I ’ m a different person now as I ’ m sure you are as well . I just hope you ’ re aware of how you were and if you have kids , to teach them to be different . If they are even close to a shadow of your younger self , then fix it . Fix them before someone else does it for you permanently . <newline> <newline> With Respect , <newline> Your Would Have Been Killer <newline>

5,"Dear Ex-Husband , <newline> <newline> It 's been 20 years since you decided you had never loved me and wanted a divorce . I think it 's time for me to finally say thank you for setting me free all those years ago . Unlike you , I am fiercely loyal , so I would 've stuck by you til the end of time , no matter how much of a douchebag loser asshole you were . Thank you for saving me from a lifetime a misery . <newline> <newline> From what I know through the grapevine , your life has been consistently sucky due to your terrible choices and habits . Apparently , you married your second wife within a few months of our divorce . You would 've married her even sooner , but you had to wait til she turned 17 . This woman has my deepest sympathy . She was n't lucky like me . You stole her whole fucking youth . <newline> <newline> Apparently this poor girl ended up serving 3 years in prison because she was caught selling drugs for *you* at the topless bar where *you* had her working to support you , due to your refusal to work . Last I heard , she was working at Dairy Queen and you were *still* unemployed . When I hear things like this I ca n't even wrap my brain around the fact that I was ever married to you . People who know me think it 's funny . <newline> <newline> My life is very different from yours . For starters , I 've been happily married for 18 years to a man who loves and adores me . On our worst day , we have a better relationship than you and I ever had on our best day . It blows my mind that I ever settled for anything less . <newline> <newline> I 'll be blunt . Our life is pretty fucking awesome . We 've built a successful business together , which has given us almost total freedom from work . I have n't woken up to an alarm clock since 2003 . We live in a beautiful home , in a safe and quiet neighborhood . I have excellent credit , and I drive an expensive convertible , which I look damn good in , by the way . We chose to keep our freedom instead being burdened with kids , which means we can do basically anything we want , anytime we want . Life is good and I have never once wished I was still with you . <newline> <newline> I was pretty broken when you told me you wanted a divorce , and I went out quietly , without making too much of fuss . But now , I want to take this opportunity to point and laugh at your shitty life . This may be immature , but it 's extremely satisfying to know that you are out there living in a shitty trailer on your dad 's land in the outskirts of that shitty one-horse town , where you 're surely still drinking your cheap shitty beer , and making shitty hamburger helper with that extra-fatty cheap ground beef , and smoking those shitty off-brand cigarettes . I 'm forever grateful to not be a part of your shitty life . Thank you ex-husband . You not loving me was the best thing that ever happened to me . <newline> <newline> Sincerely , <newline> <newline> Your smoking hot ex-wife <newline>

5,"This prompt is probably the best I 've ever found on this site . Everything I want to put into this letter has become increasingly relevant since this July ; yet , I doubt I would have written it if not for you . I 'm very grateful for that . Thank you . <newline> <newline> ___________________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> ~~Dad~~ <newline> <newline> ~~Father , if that 's what you call yourself~~ <newline> <newline> Peter , <newline> <newline> There are many things that I want to say to you in the moment - fifteen minutes ago , this morning , over Thanksgiving , in Rome and Paris - and it 's no one 's fault but mine that I am too afraid to . My 'silence ' is not completely unjustifiable ; I do n't what might happen the aftermath of outright defiance . I find it increasingly likely that the confrontation would escalate to violence and , predictably , an ensuing divorce . <newline> <newline> Unless it happens on my terms , I will not allow this . You deserve *nothing* from her - from anyone - much less half of her property and earnings . As long as your toxic behavior continues , I will always be working towards the goal of either proving that you were the catalyst of a corrupted marriage or helping her in finding her own home far , far away from you . I 'd rather not but , if I can institute my last resort and get a restraining order placed on you , I will . Maybe my sister wo n't testify in a domestic court that you are an abusive and psychologically unbalanced spouse and father but , believe me , I 'd love to . <newline> <newline> Today you called me a disrespectful shit and asked me why I am when you do so much for the family . I present this fallacy , along with your usage of Mom 's dad - who recently died of cancer - as both an insult and a manipulative , as part of my evidence that you are unfit for the privilege of being a parent and a spouse . <newline> <newline> A hypothetical rejoinder could include many , many impartial different instances and reasons : you do n't work and are therefore a parasitic detriment to society , you decline to vote and single-handedly defeat the entire purpose of the country and political system you thrive off of ; you are rude and unstable and a threat to public safety and well-being ; as a hypocrite and a willfully-ignorant citizen , you are both consciously and unconsciously working to destroy everything the light in humanity stands for . But there is no need for hypotheticals ; all that is required of me is a single answer , a mere three words . <newline> <newline> I am afraid . <newline> <newline> Of you and everything you stand for , yes , I am afraid , and that is why I can not respect you . Respect is earned , not given freely , but there is a baseline level of it afforded to each and every last human . That is what you deserve . Nothing more . <newline> <newline> You have no purpose , in life , in society , or in the human race . <newline> <newline> You actively work as a detriment to everything we should hold dear . <newline> <newline> You do not deserve to die , no . You deserve to live , as you do , without meaning or friends or art or human contact at all . <newline> <newline> Go fuck yourself sincerely , <newline> <newline> K

It 's been a while I 've talked with you , life gets in the way of myself sometimes . <newline> <newline> I 've been not so hot Josh . I went through a breakup , one that took much longer than it should 've . It 's been hard , but to he honest , when is pain easy ? I keep a straight face and stiff upper lip and tell everyone I 'm okay . <newline> <newline> But that 's as useful as a bandaid on a tumor . <newline> <newline> I live so far from everyone Josh . They 're all in good universities and living it up and having a social life and lovers . Meanwhile where did our dream derail ? We were supposed to be with them ! I know I blame our counselor for not letting us know we needed a class to make up , but I should have been more prudent . I fucked up . I know that my parents and brothers say that it 's okay , they were initially disappointed . I was supposed to be a first generation student , the pride of the entire family tree , but my leaf did not survive .

I look up to you man . I hope we can move soon to our own place , so we can rock when we want to . <newline> <newline> To Joshua : It 'll be okay . You and I know that it 's hard for us . But you have to keep going . We 'll make it , we 'll be an amazing engineer . We 'll meet a great woman who will love us beyond belief . We 'll go to three PNW and have a ball .

5,"I know this really is goodbye now , not like one of a lot goodbyes we had before . It is probably the last one . So if it is goodbye , I wanted to do it well . <newline> <newline> I 've never written a letter before . I don ’ t know why - letters are awesome . Comparing them to the internet , they seem so true and sincere . That ’ s why I wrote you a letter : I wanted to do this one thing for real . <newline> <newline> I had the idea to write you a letter on the first night when you told you 're leaving . It 's funny how hard nights can be . Everything gets quiet , more beautiful and empty . I never fear the sleepless nights , although they appear to be endless .

I probably put the address wrong , maybe this letter will get lost in way or you just wo n't open it and throw it in the trash . God , I hope so . I do n't think that writing you again is a good idea . My brain tells me I should leave you alone , forget about who you are and act like it never happened . But if you 're reading this now , I want you to know that I do n't want you to respond to this letter . I do n't hope you will call or write me . I want you to get better and let ’ s leave things like that . However , if you 'd ever need me , my help , advice , anything , I want you to know i ’ ll ALWAYS be here for you . <newline> <newline> I swear I think about it when i 'm sober and rational : I don ’ t believe in any God , I do n't believe in fate either but i ’ m sure that in everybody 's life there is a right person . Some are waiting for that person their whole life . I already got mine and I 'm sure about it . I just feel it and I can tell . But I realize that I am not your right person . It ’ s all so stupid and unfortunate . Maybe in few years I 'll find somebody who would remind me nothing of you and i will feel happy ? Maybe I would start family with that person , we would have a good life and I would die of old age surrounded by grandchildren . It sounds pretty , does n't it ? Even if that would happen , I know it will always go deeper than that . Maybe I will be really happy , but then I 'll bump on random thing like a Hozier song or fucking lip balm that you 'needed ' for your lips , or I will be driving to work and I ’ ll hear in radio news about something that happened in where you live and i 'll think of you . I 'll start thinking again that it should n't have ended this way . <newline> <newline> When my husband sees my crying after great sex what am I going to tell him ? Is he gon na know that while looking into his eyes I see the eyes of someone else ? We 're just not meant to be together and we both know it .

5,"Dear Ciarain , <newline> <newline> It 's been 9 and a half years since you died and it fucking sucks , even now . At any main event in my life or even when I 'm just having some fun with friends , I think about how different my life would be if you were still alive . For all I know we may have fallen out of being friends once we hit our late teens and all the lament I feel for a life that could have been , is all for nothing . <newline> <newline> I am happy with my life but would be happier with you in it . We were best friends and neighbours , from the moment we were born . I was too young to fully understand how sick you were when we 8/9 and then was too much of a coward to be by your side when the leukemia got worse once we started hitting 13/14 , but just know I wanted to be there , I just could n't see you fade like you did . I wish now that I had of gone over for you more , but such a cruel thing is hindsight . <newline> <newline> You were the bravest person I 've ever known . You spent close 90 % of your life dealing with cancer and you lived a fuller life than most people on this earth . Never afraid of anything knew but always with time for anyone else . You were just awesome . I mean that in the literal sense `` awe-inspiring '' . You constantly left me wanting to be a better person , something I 've carried with me , even to this day . <newline> <newline> I often think of if you had n't died , we probably would have gone to college together studying music ( I stopped music for years after you died because we joined the band together it became too hard to keep it up for a time ) , maybe realised how much a tool I was in my late teens before getting a head on my shoulders . Who knows , maybe we would have been tools together . <newline> <newline> I will never know what could have been and it haunts me because the sort of person you are ( I typed are and realised it was a mistake but I 'm leaving it in ) , you would definitely of been a positive influence and my life would be drastically different . Ultimately though , there is nothing I can do . I know you ca n't come back . I know life goes on , but I just want you to know that you are the person who has defined me the most . Made me the person I am today . I would be better with you but we must make do with what life gives us . <newline> <newline> Still missing you , probably wo n't stop . <newline> OP <newline> <newline> P.S - I never laughed harder than when you sneezed on the glass of your car when me and your brother were inside waiting for you to get in . It went everywhere .

6,"The fighting has definitely decreased since the Great Slaughter . I call it the Great Slaughter but you could call it World War Three or The Apocalypse . <newline> <newline> You see on a certain date , that I ca n't recall , everyone in the world got powers . Every persons power was different at first , but as people got married and had children the `` power pool '' became smaller and smaller . I guess recessive powers were not displayed in the child . <newline> <newline> There was a period of time shortly after that were everyone was terrified . Everyone was just figuring out their powers and no one knew how that would impact society . Nobody knew what the numbers meant either . You see when we all got powers we also got a number the mysteriously appeared on our forehead . There seemed to be no pattern in who got what number until someone committed a murder . Number 8,568,926,358 was the first to be killed . As soon as her heart stopped beating , everyone who was below her number moved up one . It only took a matter of hours for the killing to begin . All conventional rules of warfare were forgotten . entire cities were being levelled and for what ? For someone to go up a few ranks ? It was all pointless . The numbers do n't mean anything . <newline> <newline> Years passed and the world eventually evened itself out . New countries and governments were formed . Order was restored . A large group of people known as Telekenisians now rules the world . Well , what was left of it . There was only a few billion people left on earth so we could all fit in one giant city . <newline> <newline> *We* did n't live in that city though . it was too dangerous for us . Who were we ? We were the top ten . The last surviving adults . The only ones who remember the beginning . We were lucky . All of us had the most powerful , the most unique of powers . Everyone in the city knows where we live . In fact , every now and then some freak comes to try and kill us . To try and kill me . Every single on of them fails . Why ? Because I simply do n't let them .

6,"After the superhuman registration act of 2101 everyone had been ranked . It was illegal to attack someone with a lower number than your own , but you could challenge up , and if you killed someone you took their number . <newline> <newline> I did n't realise I had a power for a long time , so I had n't submitted myself for ranking . It was during an out of control fight between the # 1 and # 2 which levelled half of London that I accidentally assumed the mantle of # 1 . Ever since I keep getting challenged by people vying for a pathetic title I did n't even want . <newline> <newline> I 've tried to give it up , but they wo n't let me . People have grown accustomed to the ranking , and challenges are often recorded and broadcast to millions on sense-streams . <newline> <newline> Here comes another one now . It 's # 3 looking cocky in his red costume . He 's been to see the oracle ( # 4 ) and thinks he 's going to win . They always think they are going to win . I suppose in some way they always do . <newline> <newline> I 'm trying to remember what # 3 's power is when I feel the air being pulled out of my lungs . I gasp for breath reflexively , but no air comes in . I remember he can control gasses ; I 've got about 10seconds until I pass out . I reach into my pocket and pull out a piece of paper which I hold out . It simply says *Please have mercy* . He laughs and says `` You did n't give the previous # 1 any mercy , it 's time you died for your crimes ! '' <newline> <newline> I sadly shake my head and collapse on the floor , I feel my consciousness slipping away . <newline> <newline> *Gasp* <newline> <newline> I take a deep breathe , and it feels amazing after the suffocation . I look down at my hands , encased in ridiculous red gloves . Between them , I see the corpse of the previous # 1 , twitching on the ground in the horrible death throes of suffocation . <newline> <newline> Why wo n't they stop killing me ?

6,"They call me One . Nobody knows my real name , but they know my rank . The emblem on my jacket I 've worn since it was issued to me by the Superhuman Council . <newline> <newline> Others have their jackets traded in from time to time . Supers grow old , die off , lose fights , new ones are tested and given their first ranking . My friend Sam used to be Two , but then someone new was tested , a kid named Ace replaced him . <newline> <newline> Ace is okay . He 's not as strong as Sam , but I can see where he gets his rank . He 's a flyer , and he 's faster than I 've ever seen . They call him the Human Bullet . <newline> <newline> `` What can you do , O ? '' He asked yesterday . <newline> I looked at him in frustration . <newline> <newline> `` I mean , sorry . Is it okay if I call you O ? '' <newline> <newline> I furrowed my brow . People who ask too many questions annoy me . <newline> <newline> `` 'Is pow'r is bein ' a fookin wanker '' Seven blabbered , belligerently drunk . `` He cannae even fight a Bullymonkey '' <newline> <newline> `` Shut up , Sev '' Sam said . His new Three jacket looked sharp . It 's red was much brighter than my own . It occurred to me that I could probably get a new one if I asked for one . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll handle him , Three . '' Four said . She held Sam and Seven apart by two tendrils of darkness . <newline> <newline> `` It 's tru , Fo ! '' Seven shouted . He pushed her away . He took another drink . `` I ought to take 'im out . We could all use a good bump up . '' <newline> <newline> He started at me , fist cocked , transforming to stone . <newline> <newline> `` No . '' I wispered , and he was sent flying into the wall of the Champions chambers . He died screaming , hands over his ears in pain . <newline> <newline> I am One , the unspoken .

6,"\ # 21904 . That used to be my name , three days ago , and now I 'm , well , # 1 . <newline> <newline> No one in the city knows how it happened . The Top 30 , the ruling cabal , have absolutely no idea . I still have n't figured it out , either . <newline> <newline> All I remember is walking into a meeting where # 1 was giving a speech- for the first time , since I 'd finally turned 18 and had to follow the city 's decrees . He did n't even say a word ; he just randomly glared at me , told me to come up to the podium- and , overcome with dread , I did . Then he thrust his dagger toward me . <newline> <newline> I closed my eyes and realized he 'd held it backwards ; the hilt was in my hands . Before I could react , he jerked it back sharply and blood shot out of his chest straight into my face . His power was telepathy , not immortality . I screamed . He was smiling . <newline> <newline> He did n't even bother to speak . Nobody else in the room even gasped . I was # 1 , and they accepted it . They were smiling , too . <newline> <newline> I wish I 'd been able to figure out what was going on , but I 've been around 18 years and I have n't even found out my power . There 's no chance of me figuring it out anytime soon , either , since every day I face another challenge . Some are from the remaining Top 30 , the ones who were n't at the meeting , and others are just nobodies who think they have a shot because of what happened to me . <newline> <newline> Thing is , at all the public challenges , the same thing happens . They come in there grimacing , but when they get up , they use their power against themselves . They all die . Smiling . And the crowd smiles too . <newline> <newline> It seems like they all just want me to win .

6,"It was cute , really . The way the weak flock to me , begging for my protection from those more powerful than they . The way the strong challenge me , only to cower in fear once my power is revealed to them - for but a fleeting moment . The trick was that it was a secret - the secret gave it power , made it something to be in awe of , to be terrified of . And the more they feared it , the more it became something to be feared . <newline> <newline> The top is a lonely , cold place . I have long lost those closest to me ; lost them to betrayals , to their own fears , to the strategies of my challengers . Not that it really matters to me - I 'm more powerful as the lone wolf . The independent alpha radiates more power , and that makes me feared . And the fear fuels me . <newline> <newline> When they get me one on one , convinced that their own silly little power will do them any good against me - well , then I can taste their bravado , masking the tremors of fear . I can feel their every twitch and tremble , sense their eyes tracking every movement , ready to defend against whatever I was going to do . And the longer I wait , the more the terror builds . <newline> <newline> There is no sensation quite like the Change coming over me . I never know what I 'm going to become , or where we 'll , or for how long . But the thrills , the waves of pure euphoria when my body twists and morphs and changes - it 's incomparable . The spikes of fear when they see their deepest horrors made manifest is icing on the cake . When I reach into their paralysed bodies to steal their souls , it 's almost an anticlimax . Almost . <newline> <newline> It good being number 1 .

Yeah , suppose he was going to attack eventually . <newline> <newline> She ran through many different time-tables and scenarios . Skip breakfast ? 57 % . Quick breakfast ? 85 % . Morning jog ? 91 % . She hmmed aloud as her mind flipped through the universe . Wear her kevlar ? 92 % . 1 % improvement probably because he was a Level 5 Kineticist with Level 8 Fine Manipulation who loved accelerating tiny objects like bullets . Kevlar generally only stopped up to level 3 Kineticists , but apparently it might help . <newline> <newline> Eventually she figured out her 99.8 % scenario and began the day . Her Kevlar was on , but only for her thighs . Her right boot was a steel toe , while her left was not . She wore sunglasses , even though it was going to be cloudy all day .

A few more knickknacks and bits of tech she 'd appropriated from Technologists left her ready for the day . <newline> <newline> Most days were above 99 % . It had been quite some time since Kathy had been attacked , especially by a # 5 like Minuteman . # 2 and # 3 ( Invincible and Victoria , respectively ) had essentially agreed to a truce after twenty fights without a victor - they were unkillable after all , unlike Kathy .

A bully would take a toy from me or some stupid shit . Thing is , though , I would just make another appear . No problem . Hell , A kid would hit me , and I would simply think myself better . <newline> <newline> When you have everything , revenge just is not a topic that really matters . <newline> <newline> Which is where the problem falls . I mean I have everything . I can get anything . I mean , where is the point ? I THOUGHT world hunger out of existence . World . Fucking . Hunger . Within seconds , everyone had food -- and not just any food . I thought this out . Everyone had their favorite foods , for the rest of their lives . <newline> <newline> And just ... Fuck . <newline> <newline> people ate themselves to death . Others hoarded . Some still starved themselves .

6,"Hi , I 'm going to tell my little story here rather quickly as I am rushed for time . Being # 1 makes a lot of folks very interested in killing me , so I have to constantly remain on edge . <newline> <newline> If there were no ranking systems , most people would assume that I have absolutely no powers . My power is a much more subtle one . But enough tension building , I 'll just tell you what it is right now . I have the power of deception . <newline> <newline> Seems pretty lame compared to some of the other powers around here -- rank # 2 has laser vision for Christ 's sake -- but it definitely has its uses . I can make anyone believe or do anything I want . For example , today I convinced a man with acid breath to kill himself . Needless to say , that was a pretty dark moment for me , but I 've done worse . <newline> <newline> I like to think I 'm a pretty charming guy . It helps me manipulate people when I need to . My girlfriend is rank # 4 in the city and rank # 1 for females . She sadly has the power to crush a man 's soul . Ok that 's not entirely true , but she does have supersonic speed . I hope you do n't think that I accidentally fell in love with the most powerful woman in the city , I planned it . She is entirely convinced that I love her and that really comes to my advantage . She 'll do absolutely anything for me , and that can really come in handy for someone as targeted as me in this city . In a way I guess I do love her . I love that she will do simple things for me like robbing a bank . And I especially love the complex things : like murdering her powerful , high ranking family for me . The poor girl ca n't help but to be infatuated with me -- literally . <newline> <newline> Anyways , thats the gist of how I became # 1 here . Call me an asshole if you want , but that 's the type of personality you have to have to remain on top . It 's survival of the fittest , baby . The strong survive and the weak die . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

6,"It is nice to be king . Maybe it would be better if everyone was n't trying to kill me , but things could be much worse . I have a nice apartment , a beautiful girlfriend , some good money , and really what more does a man need to be happy ? I suppose love , but we are in love , and honestly , no one else thinks she is beautiful , so I think we were made for each other . <newline> <newline> Now , how did I reach this pinnacle you ask . Well , the answer is quite simple , my power is not all that impressive , actually it is rather bad . Same with hers , but together , it works out quite well . You see , you have to declare when you are going to kill someone of a higher rank , that way we know who killed them , and they know that they are being hunted . So when someone say that they are going to come gunning for me , I open up a video call with them . <newline> <newline> A simple video call . Nothing more nothing less , but what I do on that call shows my power . No one knows what it is of course , I make sure of that by keeping the calls private . When I get them online I talk to them , and eventually I suggest we flip a coin . This is my power . I flip a coin with another person , heads , he dies , tails , I die , and no , double-headed coins do n't count . Why would I use something so risky , you may wonder . Simple really , my girlfriends power is over luck . Playing poker and she says cards , that will be her hand . Call a coin flip , that is the way it will land . <newline> <newline> Together we rose up here . It is really surprising that no one else ever thought to work together , but I suppose they really are just to power hungry to share anything . It is quite a shame . I am sure that there are better combos than this . Now I really must be going , and so must you I 'm afraid , after all you know my secret now . `` Sweetheart , you think it is going land on heads again ? ''

6,"She could see smell . She could see me coming all the way down the street , towards her . I must have looked massive , with a fog of iridescent light trailing behind me , filling up the street with putrescence . I finally reached her location and she recoiled back , began to run away . I could see her slowly lose her composure as she slowly lost coordination , staggering to the ground . <newline> <newline> I reached her and checked for a pulse . Her nose was red , completely inflamed . She was not breathing . That 's what she gets for her unfortunate curiosity , the curiosity to try and figure out what exactly it was she saw . <newline> <newline> I went through my day with little to no interference . Alone , everywhere I went people scurried away . I have forgotten what it was like before I attained my power . Forgotten by now even what loneliness was . When I finally reached the loft in which I lived , in an unused part of town , abandoned industrial sector near the dirty river , I thought I heard the sound of breathing . Was someone trailing me ? <newline> <newline> Impossible , I thought . No one can stand the stench for too long- some even cough up their lungs , left turned inside out . I hid behind a corner and waited . I finally saw it . Their luminscent tag showed brightly - 34221 . A 30k ? Trailing ME ? ! Interesting . <newline> <newline> I stepped out of the shadow . My protective vest reflected against my tag , my raincoat black against the shadows of the wall . <newline> <newline> `` What 's your power ? '' I asked calmly . The figure stepped forward , and lifted it 's head . The silhouette revealed- disfigurement . They had somehow figured out my secret , the trail of dead bodies I have left behind enough of a clue to figure it out . Their unique talent enough overcome my power . <newline> <newline> The silhouette revealed an abscess in the face where a nose was supposed to me . Calmly the figure stepped to me and placed a hand on my shoulder . Immediately I felt weak , felt the strength leave my legs and I slumped to the ground . I saw the tag in front of me slowly start to change , like miles on an odometer .

6,"*Number 1 -- ranked number 1 for 20 consecutive years today , and nobody has even come close to usurping me . Do you know why ? Because while all the powerless , scum-dwelling peasants are fighting each other with knives for scraps , and those of the middle and upper classes are all tearing each other apart to rise through the ranks , I am in a class of my own . The truth is , my power is the weakest , least extravagant power imaginable . But , it is also the most powerful . My power is subtle , discrete , and soft-spoken .

I have the power of mass , psychic hypnotism . For 20 years , the people of this city have believed the lie that I am God incarnate because I have thrust it upon their conscious minds . And so too they believe the greatest lie this city maintains -- that the list exists at all . * <newline> <newline> *They worship me . I am an idol and an icon , and those who have been reduced to icons have been exalted beyond humanity . In other words , no one dares touch me . I am naked . Here I stand with no armor in the midst a field of warring titans , and yet I have been unscathed all this time . * <newline> <newline> *The power of belief is as strong and permanent as any iron , if not stronger . The motto I have made -- and made well-known -- for this city is `` Strong as Iron . '' They believe it is about them . But underneath , on the hidden layer they can not see , it is about the only that matters . It is about me . The holder of the key to faith . The rope that holds the cargo in place . The iron that is stronger than iron . * <newline> <newline> These were the final thoughts of the monarch before they captured him . Before they raided his office and dismantled 20 years of a rock-solid faith . Before they tied him to a post with rifles to his face . Those were his final thoughts . And these were his final words : `` how did you know ? '' <newline> <newline> And the people replied : `` even iron can melt . '' <newline> <newline>

6,"I just looked over at the poor kid . She did n't want to be here . Not anymore . I could tell she was done from the way she lay there , doing nothing more than just trying to breath . Damn , I must be getting old , but she 's so young ; really still a brat . And just like that she stopped gasping like a fish . For a few minutes she was just there , panting , taking deep lungfuls of precious life , and fighting not to pass out . Once it seemed like she was okay I had some questions for her . Her answers pissed me off , but I was n't entirely surprised . I 'd been Zero-One for almost fifty years after all . <newline> <newline> Her rank was higher than I expected , a respectable seven-three . The last idiot I had to kill was somewhere in the hundred-thousands . Her power was fire control . Her name was Nikki , and it turned out she had n't been trying to rise in rank for herself , which was the reason I did n't simply explode people 's brains inside their skulls ( anymore ) . I tried to take it easy on the rare exception . <newline> <newline> Being over rank one-oh-oh , some sleazes with nasty powers but ranked in the low eight-hundreds had made threats against her family and friends and anybody she cared for , unless she could beat me . It was n't the first time some jackass tried playing puppet master . It was n't even the first time it was blackmail instead of straight mind control . <newline> <newline> I found out the who , where what powers , and then went to pay them a little visit . I do n't mind being challenged , it 's the way things work , I 'm used to it , but to try and involve other people , innocent people in the high-thousands , people just trying to live their lives , is a cowardly move I despise . Well , they 'd be dead soon . I am Zero-One for a reason . <newline> <newline> The first guy had acid breath , he got crushed against a wall before he knew I was there . The next guy saw me coming but never got time to teleport before blood gushed from his ears and eyes before he dropped dead . It went like that for the next few hours . Some actually tried to fight back , all failed . I mean , how could they win when they 'd already lost . I am the very breathe in their lungs . <newline>

6,"They . They disgust . Their sneering faces , their pointless battles , constantly vying for rank . I look down upon them and I feel no pity . For years they postured . Their taunts : all proven empty . Their attacks : rebuffed and countered . They can ’ t see it and therefore don ’ t believe it ’ s there . Nobody can argue with results . Yet they continue to line up to yank the sword from the stone and revel in their own greatness . To have a moment in the true sun while their peers envy them and their fans unctuously blog about their greatness . <newline> The worst of them is “ ranked ” # 5 . Jerome the Mighty : body like Hercules , bank account like Trump , face like Dean , brains like Kardashian , stink of the monkey cage . He can literally lift buildings , dodge bullets , faster than a speeding train , with flowing hair that shames Fabio …all that bull shit.. mere parlor tricks to me . He should stick to making shitty movies and sending mass sexts to the tweens who fawn over him . He jerks off to his own “ hacked ” dick pics . When he finally came for me , to show me “ who the real man is ” I showed him…his own body after I snapped off his head and reanimated it so he could see know pathetic he is compared to me . Then I fixed him and gave him the worst possible fate , having to live as the miserable creature his fans believe him to be . So fast that nobody knows what happened , only that he came , he saw , and I conquered . His subconscious knows the truth , that he is less than an insect to me , that I can break him and put him back together before he takes a final gasp of the air he isn ’ t entitled to . And he is one of many . <newline> They come , they taunt , they balk , and then I send them home and they never come to me again . “ # 2 ” , “ # 3 ” , “ # 4 ” along with a many others in the top 500 know better than to knock on my door to “ usurp ” me . Some amongst them I subconsciously condemned to suffer a fate similar to my own . Although tenuous , their understanding of true power is somewhat acceptable ; that powerful is the state of not needing others to fear , respect , like , or hate you to be fully secure in one ’ s position . Others , are just fun to play with . <newline>

6,"I remember when the flood first went through the warehouse and contaminated the water ... That was before they called this city Paradise Falls . It did n't happen immediately , more gradually . People started reacting strangely . The more they stayed in the city , the more they changed . Some claim that it changed the personality of people in the city . i believe that the city only allowed people to show their real colors . <newline> <newline> The contaminated water was just , in that what it did to the individual varies . The water favored no one . If you were lucky , it would kill you quickly . That would save you from someone else getting to you with whatever strange powers they had . Some people could control you with thought alone , forcing you to physically torture yourself in whatever way they pleased . Others had unusual amounts of strength that no amount of steroids could give . <newline> <newline> Those of us who hid could usually get away with living a safe but meager life . Until the government built walls around Paradise Falls and issued us all badges with a number . These were to be our `` ID 's '' , how they would keep track of us . The violent villains of the city decided right then and there that those badges would be better off as a rank than an ID . Anyone with a low number was violently murdered , just so that a more dangerous creature could step up their rank . <newline> <newline> ... and here I am , sitting in the richest mansion that rests in the confines of Paradise 's walls , with a badge that has the number `` 1 '' on it . I often casually walk through the town , with my chin held high to promote my confidence . If I so much as glance towards anyone , their expression will instantly turn to agony . Sometimes I even glare at someone and make a sudden movement , just to make them scurry off like a scared rat . <newline> <newline> When people see me , they assume I have some incredible power that I can wield without flaw . The truth is , I found my power far before this city became contaminated . I can manipulate people , make them bend to my will just through intimidation and smooth talking . In fact , I 'm the only one who did n't change when I drank that water . <newline> <newline> Do n't think I did n't put in my share of a contribution- these badges would still be ID 's if I never stepped in . I 'm never in danger , ranked number 2 , 3 and 5 are incredible , they can save me in a heartbeat if someone I walk by gets bold .

6,"Ever since March , people in this city have started manifesting superpowers . Nobody knows why . Nobody 's sure if people are gaining powers gradually , or if everyone got them all at once when the numbers appeared , and it just took a while for them to figure out what they were . Right , the numbers . We all had numbers randomly appear on us one day . As far as anyone can tell , it started off random . But with the crime spree that the superpowers predictably brought , something suddenly became apparent . If you kill someone with a lower number , your number changes to theirs , and everyone with a higher number goes down by one . Pretty soon , some of the villains started hunting down people with low numbers . <newline> <newline> I made something of a name for myself by hunting down the worst supervillains . A lot of people did n't take me seriously since I did n't use flashy powers . A lot of people found out that shotgun shells can do more damage than most superpowers . That was n't all I did , of course . I did research . I wore body armor . I had a friend with a sniper rifle for in case things got too far out of hand . <newline> <newline> There was one supervillain that controlled the city . He had his henchmen search every man , woman , and child for the one with the number one , just so he could be the one to kill him . I wanted to take him down , but he was smart . He did n't just rely on his own powers . The guy had a whole tower full of capes you 'd have to fight through . He understood security . I could n't just kill him . But eventually , I realized I had to , even if I could n't kill just him . <newline> <newline> I announced that I was challenging him , and spread the word to stay well away for anyone who did n't want to be involved . At the time I said I 'd start , when everyone had evacuated , his tower collapsed . He had bodyguards that could fly , and could have carried him to safety , but his safe room did n't exactly have windows . People started speculating on what my power was , and how I could do that , but nobody really knows what it is . <newline> <newline> What is it you ask ? Like I said , nobody knows . I have n't figured it out yet . I took the building down with remotely operated mines , like a reasonable person . Maybe my superpower is not being an idiot . I 'm just a [ rational man with a shotgun ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2862yb/how_far_does_my_hero_rational_man_with_shotgun/ ) .

6,"I loved her , I 've always wanted my son to understand this . I did love her with all my being . Many might call me sick , but I still do love her . Even now , even being the one that stopped her . He was definitely old enough to remember , it was just after his 16th birthday . Just when he became legal , just when he became `` fare game '' . She had always been an assertive , hard foot forward kind of woman . That was one of the reasons I loved her . She was so strong , it was truly a site to behold when she would tactfully unleash her awesome power upon those who threatened her rise . It was beautiful . I 'd always known of the things her company did , the things she did , but that was just part of who she was . Maybe I really was blind , but I never could have imagined that she would try to kill our own son . It makes a sense , in a twisted way , now when I think about it . He would undoubtedly come to have the same power as she did , he might even be stronger . The stronger power was always the one that was passed down , and I had always been so weak . I do n't think she knew I was home . I had decided to come home for lunch from work and the front door was left open so I did n't really make much noise coming in . I had just happened to walk into the kitchen as she was leaving and glimpsed that rag in her hand , and the bleach on the kitchen island . Fear had worked it 's magic quickly as I realized what she was doing . My son always fell asleep right after he got home , and it was just that time . I guess that 's why I had grabbed the knife so quickly . She was walking slow too , trying not make any noise . So was I. I saw her turn the corner in the hall towards his room . My feet rushed me to her as I turned the corner and my knife was in her chest . Right in her heart . I like to think the sight of my face gave her pause . I am still alive after all . <newline> <newline> I live with my son now . Killing her ranked me # 1 and there was no way I was going to stay living long with that over my head , not alone . He protects me now . He does n't have her ambitions , but if he ever did decide to take my position from me I 'd forgive him . I love my son . <newline> <newline> Edit : Format

6,"Ever since the accident , we all have powers . Super strength , teleportation , invulnerability . I do n't know how it happened . After that day though , I 'm unstoppable . I 'm number 1 . <newline> <newline> My powers seem to adjust to whoever I fight . If someone tries to punch me , they pass right through . If they try to freeze me , I become an inferno . A bully from school attacked me , he did n't stand a chance . No one ever knows what my power will be . I 've flown , duplicated myself , manipulated the earth , read minds , anything I can imagine . <newline> <newline> The other day my brother came to fight me . He seemed , almost , heartbroken . I could n't tell what his power was . I tried reading his mind . It was like a fortress . I tried and tried to listen . I could barely make out a few words , ' , , , brother , , , die , , . ' For some reason I was terrified , I fled to where he could n't follow . <newline> <newline> I was number 1 , I had never been beaten . What was his power ? I could n't remember anything about him after the accident . Or during . No one could remember the accident . What happened before the accident ? Wass I at school ? No , I just left . Where did I go ? <newline> <newline> All of a sudden , I felt a presence . Someone was in the dimension I had created ! It was n't possible ! No , no one was here . And if they were , I would destroy them like everyone else who crossed me . <newline> <newline> There ! Again ! It was in my mind ! A voice , my brother 's . 'Do n't leave ' What could it mean ? How could he find me ? 'Please . . . ' <newline> <newline> I left my dimension , to confront my brother . If he could use his telepathy on me there was no telling how powerful he was . I had to stop him . Had to find him . I flew towards his thoughts . Closer , he was a few blocks from where I used to go to school . <newline> <newline> A splitting pain went through my whole body . I started falling . No , I thought , he wo n't stop me . I flew directly for him . Flying through buildings ; the gas station , the deli , that office building , the hospital . He was in the hospital ! I flew down hallways , faster and faster , til I saw him sitting in a room . I advanced . He ignored me and stared at the bed . I looked over . <newline> <newline> It was me .

6,"Naturally , as the undisputed number one , I get asked a lot of questions . Things like ' how do you get your hair so perfect ' , and ' what are you doing Saturday night ? ' . Still , easily , the question I 'm asked the most is ' what , exactly , is your power ? ' . <newline> <newline> Usually , I just try and play it cool , let people guess . It 's quite interesting what they come up with . <newline> <newline> Most of their problem in guessing , however , comes from the fact that it seems like I have so many powers . They 've seen me fly , teleport , lift cars , control fire . <newline> <newline> One time , I simply talked a challenger down . I was n't even forming coherent sentences , he had some form of aerosol sedative power , made it really hard to do anything . I was just throwing out words , and he just ... gave up . That 's how good I am . <newline> <newline> Some think it 's a willpower based thing , like a real life Green Lantern . Which would be pretty awesome , actually , now that I think about it . <newline> <newline> I 've heard people guess that I can copy powers , or manifest then in self-defense , and , yeah , it tends to work out that way , but that does n't explain how I can beat you at any game you choose , first time , every time . <newline> <newline> Some people say it 's the power of positive thinking , which is a little saccharine for me , but not too far off . <newline> <newline> I mean , I 'm honestly trying to be humble here , but it 's hard to be modest when you 're number one . <newline> <newline> In the end , I really am exactly as good as I think I am .

6,"I fucking LOVE this city . That 's all there is to it . I got here half a year ago when the numbers started showing up . I was number 5,940,091 ... .. ok ... 90 , but I never could stand odd numbers , They 're bad luck . Anyway I had no clue what my power was until these 2 cents were fighting it out down the street from a bar me and my buddy hung out at . Now usually we do n't get to see many flashy fights , this part of town is where the mils hideout , the ones too weak to move up anywhere . One of em , some kind of explosion guy , got knocked straight through the wall next to me . Head crushed on impact . But get this , he dies but its not the guy who killed him whose number changes , it 's mine . Just like that I went from being a mil to a thou . Oh he was livid . Standing there all shiny , covered in some kind of diamond . He was certain the guy was n't dead , so he kept hitting the body looking at his number . Now by this point anyone with good sense was 50 feet away and running but something in the back of my head told me , touch his neck . He barely had enough time to look up at me before his head exploded . After the ringing in my ears went away I noticed it had happened again . This time I was a cent . After that day I began working my way up the ladder . Found a guy guy who thought he was invulnerable , turned out he still needed to breathe . Next I found a seer , took me almost 3 months to corner her , found a lot of good one along the way , Perfect memory , healing , the ability to talk to wolf spiders ... ok so not all of them are useful , but their mine . Now , I 'm number 1 , everyone who knew me before is dead or worse . Set myself up in the old 1 's mansion with some cute cents to wait on me living it up like a king . Visions keep telling me that the city is about to try a full scale invasion , that 's fine I ... we are ready .

6,"Footsteps . It had been so long since anyone had approached me . The stranger paused , `` Well ? '' <newline> <newline> Tiredly open my eyes slowly and looked down on them . `` A challenger ? '' I rasped at them . `` I have n't seen the likes of you- '' I break out in a coughing fit . `` I have n't had a challenger in years . They all realized- '' a wheezing noise come from my throat . `` They realized it was futile when I began building my castle ... '' I trailed off , reminiscing of the times of old . <newline> <newline> The challenger cleared their throat . `` Yes ? '' I ask . `` Do you wish to duel me ? '' . Many had tried to take my title from me over the centuries . They all fell in their vain efforts to overcome me . The faces blur together , their powers blur together . The person in front of me coughed again . They were wrapped from head to toe in ancient looking rags . Their face obscured by the shadow of their strange garb . I lean forwards , attempting to get a better look at the stranger in front of me . <newline> <newline> The challenger knowingly and slowly points a crooked old finger from under their robe . The finger rises to point at me . <newline> <newline> I had lived many millennia in my own private world . Seeing the rise and fall of nations at my own hands . <newline> <newline> Perhaps I had lived longer than I should . I ca n't even recall the incident that brought me to this strange land where I was a god .

The 11-19 people took their spots . <newline> <newline> I make sure that when I fight , nobody else sees . Nobody else can be allowed to know why I 'm so strong . Of course , it would n't matter if they did , but I might as be sure . <newline> <newline> The sad part is , these poor people all believe they actually have a chance .

6,"Society does n't want supers to fight each other for ranking . So unlike chess players , being # 1 does n't mean I kicked everyone 's ass , it just means I have a lot of `` power '' . <newline> <newline> The scientists use some formula that figures how much `` power '' you can channel on a given day , in megajoules . <newline> <newline> I 'd never manifested any powers , but a friend of mine got hired at the lab and said they would test me for free . But they made me wait . Their equipment was going batshit , none of the sensors would zero . `` Come back next week , '' he said . I went back the next week . They had borrowed a bigger sensor . It was still pegged . They compromised by having me stand outside while they took the reading . Inverse square something . They had me come in a couple more times , two nights , and once on the weekend . I was still normal . I cook dinner on the stove without heatrays , I take the bus to work instead of flying . <newline> <newline> But they told me I 'm channeling exactly as much power as every other super in town , *combined . * Plus a few percent for unregistered , and for people who have gained power since their last test . At night , my power goes down , cause everyone 's asleep . On weekends , it goes up a bit . <newline> <newline> They ranked me # 1 , but I declined to publish my power on the big list . My friend calls me `` Circuit Breaker . '' All the power in town comes through me first , and if I die , you all get to be normal .

6,"3 stood there , surrounded by 7 , 4 , and 6 , surprisingly . 6 had been a solo agent for a while - his power to affect emotions with touch did n't make him the most sociable tag ( aside from the poor sods he 'd experimented on ) , but they seemed to deem my hunting down the tags from ten onwards a horrific enough prospect that they 'd brought him on board as insurance . <newline> <newline> Sadly , my power is supreme . <newline> <newline> I felt a shiver begin at the base of my spine as it activated , power arcing up my back as it finally reached it 's destination at the crown of my skull . Six 's clothes conversed with the reflections of light that floated lazily off the lavish pool that three bought .

I stood in the centre of their formation , knife held in my hands clasped behind my back . Seven moved himself to a position where I was no longer obscuring his view , and I turned to three . My knife flashed beautifully in the rainbow reflections of light as I drew the blood that held me back from attaining the top position .

Cerebral hacking I call it . All I have to do is think about it and I 'm in your head . It 's what put me on top . My original body was lost ages ago .

6,"Everyone wants the explosive powers you know ? Super strength , laser vision , throwing lightning bolts , super speed and all that jazz .

6,"People must wonder how rank # 1 has remained rank # 1 for so long . Hell , they must wonder who rank # 1 actually is . Fact of the matter is , no one knows but me : rank # 1 . My power ? Similar to invisibility , but without actually turning invisible or redirecting light . My power is to go unnoticed . The shitty thing is I ca n't turn it off and will only be noticed if I try hard to be obnoxiously in someone 's way . Those I do manage to gain the attention of forget about me completely within a minute of my walking away . Even as an introvert it gets lonely once in a while , but the positives outweigh the costs , especially in terms of safety . I wo n't be dethroned anytime soon , and have squared away a nice home for myself by squatting in a long-abandoned but sturdy building , complete with all the comforts I could want . I entertain myself once in a while by sending messages to criminals with similar ranks to provoke them into attacking each other , watching the fight in-person or on television , depending on the likelihood of collateral damage . Invulnerability is just about a prerequisite to being an on-the-scene reporter , nowadays . Usually , though , I 'll just follow them around with a camera to anonymously send the police and media to make sure justice is served . They ca n't buy everyone , and even if I were to make myself known temporarily , I have little use for money when I can swipe whatever I want .

Mine is number 1 . <newline> <newline> Pretty quickly people started to figure out that when someone else died , everyone with a lower number moved up . There wasn ’ t really much that this meant for the higher numbers , but for the lower numbers it was a bloodbath .

Every single person here held a special ability , ranging from a power to clean everything within a 2m radius , to extreme powers such as flying or super strength . All these powers helped construct the most technologically advanced and richest city the world . One man had the power to give everybody a ranking in terms of how powerful their powers were . The minor powers caused little trouble , but conflicts to reach the top 10 cause widespread destruction . However there was one person who has held the top spot for many years . Me . * <newline> <newline> I am considered the greatest of them all - yet no one but me knows why . I have no extraordinary powers like time control , even inferior powers like the cleaning everything within a 2m radius . I am a normal human being . <newline> <newline> Since killing someone with a higher ranking gives the killer a higher ranking themselves , I have been the target of many assassination attempts . I have survived them all . Some say my power is health regeneration , but that 's not true . Some say my power is extreme luck , but that 's not true either . Maybe in 2000 years they will think my power is immortality , but that is only half true . It took me a while to find out what my power is . It 's the ability to be ranked number one on this superpower list . I am essentially immortal , as dying would mean I am not the top ranked anymore . My power is hardly powerful at all , yet I am the most powerful of them all .

6,"Determining the fates of others never seemed like a blessing to me , a simple , powerful thought could ruin the lives of countless . It took too long for me to control it , and even longer to accept the things that I have done . I never wanted to rise to the top , If I could , I would be at the bottom . But I guess that the fact that I 'm already here and will remain here could mean that people will stop killing each other for nothing more than a status . At first I honed my power to remain on top , so that people will know that trying to kill me would never work , nobody will be on top other than me and the greed might even stagnate . But that was n't enough . After much practice , meditation , and careful deliberation , I managed to stagnate the top 10 , for as long as I live , the top 10 will never change . After years more and a few , accidents , I stagnated the top 100. the power struggle started to stop . Later on , 1,000 . <newline> <newline> 1,000 of the most powerful people in the world , now immortal . At first it helped , people stopped trying to kill to rise in the ranks . But the top 1,000 started to realize that they could no longer be killed , they all became obsessed with that fact , as if they were demi-gods , that they could not kill each other , and that they could rule the world . They began to cull anyone who had a strong power , but not everyone altogether , for they toyed with them , they loved the idea that they were gods , and I could do nothing but watch . Soon , almost everyone but the 1,000 had such weak powers that they became mortal . <newline> <newline> But none of them believed anymore that I was the god above them all . They thought that it was a mistake of some sorts that I was ranked the top , that the oracles made an error . And now , I have to fix the wrongs that I have done . All the atrocities they committed were because of me , I should never have made them believe that they were immortal , because they 're not . I ca n't make everyone `` immortal '' , I ca n't make *anyone* immortal . I can not save everyone , for it will take too much time . There comes a day when angels and demons will have to fall all at once , and this day has been long overdue . I changed all our fates with a single focused thought , fates that I never knew I had the power to change until now . And I just did . Soon , very soon , the world will become mortal once more , for the so-called gods do not deserve to rule it . <newline> *** <newline> **Power : Ability to determine how and when a person dies** <newline> *** <newline> Edits : Lots of last minute grammatical changes .

6,"1st time posting , hope you all like it : ) <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> As I sit among the bloodbath around me , I feel nothing . I can not feel my arms around my knees , nor feel the tears running down my face . I have nowhere to go , nobody I can talk to . I wish I could go back . Before my 21st birthday . Before the killing started ... <newline> <newline> The days leading up to my birthday were the most exciting and daunting time of my life so far , I was the last of my friends to ‘ come of age ’ and receive their power and rank . I say receive my power , but I don ’ t really get it from anybody , you are born with your power , which then ‘ activates ’ somehow on your 21st birthday , and your rank is displayed on the back of your hand . Scientists could explain to you the entire process , but honestly I was never really interested in knowing how it happened . I was a pretty quiet girl , didn ’ t have too many friends and was always caught with my nose in a book or bent over a sketchpad . My friends didn ’ t mind though having their own heads bent over the latest handheld game or the latest issue of Who ! weekly . Kerryn was the first to come of age , a shapeshifter , given a rank of 5260 she would be given a year to learn how to use her power and find out her limits , then she would be enrolled into the government to be used in the military or FBI or whatever they did in their headquarters . Kerryn was pretty relaxed about , wasn ’ t a big deal in her eyes , her parents made a fuss though , coming from a very well off family , her parents expected nothing less . Jake was next about a month after Kerryn , and unlike her he was ecastic , ranked 8476 he never walked anywhere with us anymore , why would he when he could fly beside us ? Toby followed about 6 months later , he was probably the one I was closest to , and it didn ’ t surprise me in the least to find out he was an empath ( rank 6745 ) , he was always the one anyone of us could talk to , he just seemed to have a way with people . <newline> <newline> As my birthday loomed closer , Toby began staying closer to me , he knew how I felt about my birthday ; knew I hated the reminder that my parents had abandoned me after the birth of my brother . I was 10 when they came to me with a backpack and told me I was no longer welcome in their house , my brother was destined for a greatness I could never hope for , the local prophet foresaw nothing in my future . Toby didn ’ t need to be an empath to know that though , he knew years ago , all my friends did . I had spent the last 10 years sleeping on one of their couches to put myself through school . I wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for them . Toby also knew that a part of me was excited for this birthday – perhaps this birthday when I got my power I would find someone to mean something to . I didn ’ t care what my rank was , but people who had the same power were a lot more likely to have relationships with each other . Much more likely to love each other . Oh how I wanted to be loved ... <newline> <newline> I was with Toby when I found out my rank ; we were walking down the street to meet up with Kerryn and Jake for lunch to celebrate my birthday . Toby turned to me and said quietly ... <newline> <newline> “ I know you ’ re going to get your powers today Amy , and you ’ re hoping to be special to somebody ... . but you know ... you kinda are already special to somebody ... ” <newline> <newline> I just stared at his face , not really comprehending what he was saying ... <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry what ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re already special to somebody ... me ... I think it just took me this long to have the courage to say it ... to say I love you ... ” <newline> <newline> The kiss that followed those words left me breathless ... warmth spread throughout my entire body , my hands and shaking , my lips tingled and I couldn ’ t stop smiling ... I even started to cry ! <newline> <newline> “ I love you too Toby ... though you probably already knew that ” I say with my eyes still closed , his arms around me . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , I had a hunch ” he said with a laugh ... . <newline> <newline> As I pull away from him the glow on the back of my left hand becomes noticeable ... <newline> <newline> “ Toby , look ! ” I say showing him my hand <newline> <newline> “ Number 7,282,155 , wow , that ’ s almost the population of the entire world ! ” <newline> <newline> My smile starts to slip as I ask <newline> <newline> “ Are you disappointed ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Not at all ” he replied leaning in for another kiss . <newline> <newline> We resume walking to our lunch spot , hand in hand , our smiles mirrored on each other ’ s faces . It ’ s not long before Jake comes flying towards us , and before I know what ’ s happening his lips are locked onto mine ... <newline> <newline> “ Hey what gives ? ” I ask pushing him off me . <newline> <newline> “ Amy , I ’ m sorry I never realised before , but I want you more than anything else , I love you and I need you ... ” Jake quickly says while trying to kiss me again . I push him away again in protest , but before I can say anything Jake is knocked to the ground as Toby lunges at him . <newline> <newline> “ Back off Jake , I love her ” Toby says with a growl . Jake gets off the ground and fists start flying ... This goes on for ten minutes maybe , the whole time I ‘ m pleading with them both to stop , were supposed to be friends , I ’ m not worth fighting over . Without any warning Jake remembers his power and picks up a struggling Toby into the air and soars miles above the ground . <newline> <newline> Tears streaming down my face I scream at Jake to bring Toby back to the ground ... To my horror , Jake does exactly that ... by letting go of him . Toby hit the ground with a sickening thud and doesn ’ t move . I am frozen to the spot ; I can not believe what has just happened . My mind is reeling as I look at Toby ’ s now severely disfigured form , blood seeping into the grass around him , bone shards protruding through his elbows and knees ; it is something out of a horror film . I somehow regain some of my senses and rush towards him lying on the ground ; I ’ m sobbing his name over and over as my hands are reaching towards him , cradling his shattered face . <newline> <newline> As Jake lands back on the ground he starts to say something but I cut him off ... <newline> <newline> “ What the fuck Jake ? ! ? ! ? ! Toby was your best friend ! Oh my god what is wrong with you ! ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry Amy but I love you ... and he was going to get in the way ... ” <newline> <newline> I reel back from him in horror and disgust ... there had never been anything but friendship between Jake and myself . Never . Jake and his girlfriend of 4 years were planning to marry at the end of the year ... What the hell was going on ? <newline> <newline> Confused and upset , I fled . Toby was dead , and his murderer was professing his love for me . I ran , blinded by tears . I had barely run half a mile when I crashed into somebody . It was Kerryn . Oh god how could I tell her what had happened ? <newline> <newline> “ Oh Kerryn ... ” I cried collapsing in her arms . <newline> <newline> “ Toby ... Jake ... I don ’ t understanding what happened ... . ” <newline> <newline> I can ’ t speak ... the words are sticking in my throat , choking me as I sob into Kerryn ’ s shoulder . <newline> <newline> “ Shhhhh ... .. ” Kerryn whispers , hugging me , comforting me like you would a small child who has scraped their knee for the first time . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s okay Amy , whatever it is , it will be okay ... . I ’ ll take care of you ... ” <newline> <newline> “ But you don ’ t understand what has happened ... Toby is ... ” <newline> <newline> “ It doesn ’ t matter ... “ She interrupts.. <newline> <newline> “ Whatever has happened doesn ’ t matter , your here now . You ’ re safe with me ... I ’ ll take care of you ... I love you ... ” <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> There were those words again ... those three damned words . <newline> <newline> I pull away from her ... I am so confused . I stagger backwards and before either of us can say anything there is a blinding flash of light in front of me ... And an awful smell . I start gagging and am brought to my knees . After a few moments the light fades and standing in front of me is a smoking crater where Kerryn had once stood . From across the park there is a blazing trail of grass and ash , starting from what used to be Kerryn , to one of the town ’ s pyro ’ s . It was only moments later that his body was lying in pieces around the park , blasted away from a particle manipulator . All around me mothers battled fathers , neighbours fought children , and friends became enemies ... all shouting the same thing ... <newline> <newline> “ I love you Amy ... ” <newline> <newline> People were destroying each other over a complete stranger . All around me was death and destruction spread throughout the city . Fire and blood lined the streets as madness overtook them . I was a disease , a parasite , and I was destroying everyone . I tried to plead with them ; I tried shouting at them ... it made no difference . It took me a while to notice the number on my hand was a blurred line of ever changing numbers . It was hours before the screaming stopped . Before the city lay quiet . Hours ... That ’ s it all it took for thousands of people to destroy each other . But even when the city was quiet , the numbers kept changing ... I found myself outside a cafe with the TV still running amongst the destruction . The picture was sideways , as if the camera had been dropped but was still somehow being broadcasted . The banner down the bottom read : International News – Live from Spain . Spain ... that was another country ... worlds away . I don ’ t know how . I don ’ t know why ... but the disease that I was had spread everywhere . I was destroying the world ... <newline> <newline> It was days before the numbers stopped changing . Days I spent sitting in that park , not moving , tears streaming down my face ... I had destroyed the world ... <newline> <newline> I guess the prophet was right in the end ... there is nothing in my future . Nothing ... and nobody . <newline> <newline> ... I am rank # 1 ... But dear god I wish I wasn ’ t ... <newline>

6,"`` I want to die '' <newline> She held the energy blade to my throat . It pushed against my skin and it burned <newline> `` Damnit ! I want to die but you ca n't kill me ! '' <newline> Her eyes narrowed in suspicion . She did n't say anything . She did n't really talke much . being the second most powerful human says a lot about your strength , but nothing about your social skills . I could feel the tension in her body . I felt the blade break skin and I flinched . Blood was leaking out of me . Great . She frowned . <newline> `` Why do n't you defend yourself ? '' <newline> I felt the energy seep out of me . I was going to have to explain . Again . <newline> `` Listen . If you kill me I do n't die . You do . I take your body '' <newline> Again the only response was her eyes squinting <newline> `` I take peoples bodies when I die . That 's my power . But it comes at a cost . I get sick . Any body I 'm in is sick . I 've been sick for the last couple thousand years . Somebody always kills me . And I always take their body . And then in their body I get sick . The first thing the sickness takes is the powers . So this is how it 's going to go down . You 're gon na kill me with that cool energy blade of yours . Then I wake up and I 'm you . But no more energy blades . I lose your powers . What I do get is chronic pain , spontaneous bruising , migraines , and a burning in my chest that never goes away . '' <newline> I shrugged . She seemed unimpressed and unbelieving . <newline> `` The last time I tried killing myself I woke up three days later and realised I took my own body . The dumb assess around me started calling me messiah and spreading rumors that I was a martyr that died on a cross . Fuck that '' <newline> Again she seemed unmoved . I was growing impatient . <newline> `` Do you believe me ? `` <newline> `` Yes '' <newline> That took me back a second . No one ever believed me before . <newline> `` Are you going to kill me then ? `` <newline> `` Yes '' <newline> `` What the hell ? Why ? '' <newline> `` I ca n't stop it '' <newline> She nodded towards my chest . I looked down . It was covered in blood . My blood . From my neck . I forgot I was bleeding . Between the pain in my skull and the fire in my chest I barely noticed that the cut in my neck was bleeding out . I 'm too used to being in pain . <newline> `` Well shit '' <newline> And then I blinked . <newline> I looked at my hands and the energy blade faded into nothing . I looked at my old body . Empty . Bloody . Useless . Once the most powerful human being . <newline> I felt the fire ignite in my chest . I felt the migraine come back . <newline> `` Man ... .I just want to die ''

6,"[ The offices of Superhuman Numbering and Registration - 7:26 AM ] <newline> <newline> **Two weeks** never felt so long . I had to admit it - I was **good** . <newline> <newline> The elevator was empty this morning , and I relished in the momentary privacy , stretching widely . My physician had told me my shoulder was good enough for *tennis* , but I was only thinking about jetting down to Arizona for a game of *golf* . <newline> <newline> As the elevator doors opened , my secretary stood to attention with lightning speed . <newline> <newline> `` **Fred** - hold my calls . I 'm going to be *concentrating* . '' <newline> <newline> Fred nodded curtly and sat down . <newline> <newline> `` Yes ***Mr . Avendrew*** . '' <newline> <newline> I winced - years memories of postgraduate work flooded my head upon hearing the word 'mister . ' Today , I would let that one *slide* . <newline> With a polite , near involuntary smile I walked through the doors of my office . <newline> <newline> They ***slammed*** shut behind me . <newline> <newline> `` Well , well ... if it is n't the **Maestro** . '' <newline> <newline> I felt a cold chill *shoot* down my spine - originating from the *barrel of a gun* pressed against the back of my *head* . <newline> <newline> Another wanna-be . It seemed routine now . I had a plan this time . <newline> <newline> `` Well ... that 's a fine how-do-you-do ... ***Maynard*** . '' <newline> <newline> The gun shuddered . <newline> <newline> `` Whoa , partner - you 're talking to ... '' <newline> <newline> `` ***The Lone Gunman*** '' I said , cutting him off . I better talk fast . <newline> <newline> `` Listen , Maynard , I know your ***secret identity*** . I know a lot more about you than you *realize* - but there is one thing I do n't know - *who sent you here* ? '' <newline> <newline> He commanded the silence and took his time before replying - the way only someone from the **South** can do . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know how you know what you do . But I reckon that wo n't much matter in a few minutes . I do n't feel it 's fair to *kill* a man without giving him a chance to say his *peace* . '' <newline> <newline> `` Awfully generous of you . '' Time to try something ***new*** . I started concentrating , and turned around to face him . <newline> <newline> A beam of light from the blinds rested over his eyes , which shone large between his hat and his bandanna . <newline> <newline> `` Listen , Maynard . Do you know what I ***do*** around here ? '' <newline> <newline> He thought for a moment . `` You 're the **Maestro** - you 're *numero-uno* , and that makes you the only thing standing between me and staking my **final claim** . '' <newline> <newline> `` What , Maynard ? What is that *last claim* ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't play tricky with me - I am talking about **number one** - the **top-dog** . '' <newline> <newline> I backed up and slowly poured myself a glass of scotch and took a sip . His revolver was trained steadily on me the whole time . <newline> <newline> `` There 's something I have n't told you , Maynard . Something I have n't told ***anyone*** . Before you go about *killing* me , I want you to know . '' <newline> <newline> He nodded , the gun still trained on me . <newline> <newline> `` When you were 11 you lived on a *farm* with your *aunt* , did n't you ? '' <newline> <newline> He stared in disbelief , before pushing the gun into my face . `` I do n't like ***reminiscing*** - speed things up . '' <newline> <newline> `` You saw some lights one night and went out to the barn . Something happened , and the whole thing went up in ***flames*** . Your aunt ... she ***died*** ... trying to save you . '' <newline> <newline> A tear rolled down his cheek . `` You got **five** seconds . '' <newline> <newline> `` But *someone* did manage to get you out . And when you were lying on the ground next to the well , they gave you some water , and they said *something* . '' <newline> <newline> The gun drooped down . <newline> <newline> In unison we spoke `` Have ***faith*** , my boy . A hero always looks forward , never down . '' <newline> <newline> He dropped the gun . `` ***Father Saul*** ? '' <newline> <newline> `` My boy . I am so glad to see you again . '' <newline> <newline> I clasped my arms around him , and he lifted me into the air with his grip . <newline> <newline> `` I ***swear*** I did n't know it was you ! I thought I would never see you again , Padre ! '' <newline> <newline> I glanced back at my drawing board - two more pages left . I guess it was time to set things up for the next issue . This would be a tough one to rationalize , but it was canon now . <newline> <newline> Ninja Edit : I am torn about the use of comic-style extensive bolding and italics , but I felt it helped emphasize the theme . Perhaps it should just come out of there altogether .

6,"This would be a city like any other if it was n't for all the people with powers . At any given time there are 1203 people in this city with abilities beyond the normal . Why 1203 ? I do n't know it 's just one of the many mysteries that surround this situation . Another mystery is the ranking system . This table can be accessed online easily and shows every individual with powers ranked from 1 being the most powerful to 1203 being the least powerful . However this ranking system is subject to change as if a lower number kills a higher number they assume the rank of the person they killed . The rankings for the top 100 are displayed on electronic billboards throughout the city . No-one knows who transmits the data and any attempts to change what the billboards display has been met with failure . <newline> <newline> Ok that 's the background maybe I should start explaining how I fit into this . When I was born a city full of super powered individuals was just a part of everyday life and was something that anyone without a power just let go on around them . When I was in primary school my friends and I played games where we would pretend to have powers , traded the cards with the top supers stats on and collected the toys . It grew to be an obsession . At 14 I wished more than anything that I would get a power , by 16 I was beginning to accept that it would probably never happen and by the day before my 18th birthday I 'd come to the realisation that not having a power was probably a good thing . After all , the violence and politics that drove the 1203 and even more so the individuals who were ranked closer to being number 1 seemed like a detraction from the fun of actually having a power . <newline> <newline> However when I woke up on my 18th birthday the first text I received was not wishing me Happy Birthday but instead was from my friend asking what my power was . Naturally I was confused but sure enough my name now sat at 1203rd place on the super power leader board . I did n't feel any different . I was no stronger , I could n't move any faster . All my previous flaws and familiar weaknesses were still there . <newline> <newline> I was walking home later that night when someone tried to mug me . The best thing to do when someone threatens you with a knife is to just hand over your money , that 's what I 'd always been told ; the contents of your wallet are worth less than your life . I knew all that but when he asked me to hand over my cash I froze like a deer in headlights unable to move . “ ARE YOU FUCKING DEAF ? ! GIVE ME THE MONEY ! ” he screamed at me . That was when the chunk of stone smashed into his head . The police said later that I was lucky a piece of masonry had dislodged from the building we were next to . I didn ’ t feel lucky , I ’ d almost been mugged and I hadn ’ t be able to do anything even though I supposedly had a power . <newline> <newline> Two more years passed and I still had no idea what my power was but at 1203rd position it wasn ’ t like anyone felt threatened by me anyway so life went on . Until my rank rose anyway . The highest and most continuous level of fighting occurs between the final 203 ranked supers . I guess being that low breeds insecurity . Number 1100 tried to attack me the other day . His power was low level telekinesis and he tried to use his mind to break me . I got a mild headache at worst while he became visibly more frustrated , eventually he went red in the face and collapsed to the floor . The medical team said he ’ d given himself an aneurysm which is pretty unlucky really . <newline> <newline> Since then more people have made attempts on my life . What creates the most annoyance for them is that I never seem to do anything . I ’ m not strong , or fast , I can ’ t control weather or the elements but when people attack me nothing goes right for them . A pyrokenetic tried to burn me to death once , unfortunately she was stood next to a propane canister when she started summoning flame and it turns out that the ability to control fire isn ’ t of much use when a shard of metal from an exploded gas canister slashes open your jugular . And you know the ironic thing ? Her immunity to burns meant she couldn ’ t cauterise the wound closed . Now that ’ s unlucky . <newline> It ’ s been ten years since I entered the ranking system and I ’ ve been at number 1 for the last five without ever having to do anything . I never wanted to be at the top but when you get a reputation things fall into place whether you want them to or not . Am I worried ? For a time I was but not anyone , by now I know that anyone who tries to hurt me will fail . <newline>

6,"Crime was at an all time low in the city of New Angeles . Come to think of it , so was tourism and GDP . <newline> <newline> Some people credited this to the genius of *Genetevolve Labs* and their breakthroughs in affordable human enhancements . Although , not everyone was pleased with the results . After a session of copying and splicing , it was often several months - or even years - before a patient actually knew what they had gotten themselves into . <newline> <newline> For example , there was Nickolette ... <newline> <newline> After several sessions , and a freak bowling accident , Nickolette had come to the realization that she was telekinetic . She came to appreciate her new-found ability , despite the lifetime ban from *Richie 's Bowleramma* . Apparently Richie 's insurance refused to pay for the removal of over a thousand bowling pins from the ceiling of the establishment . <newline> <newline> Ty was Nickolette 's best friend . He had completely given up on genetic therapy until after almost two-years after his last session he stumbled drunk out into a busy roadway and was nearly flattened by a semi truck . Instead , the truck was smashed into oblivion upon striking Ty and the only injury he sustained was permanently soiled underwear . <newline> <newline> Then ... then there was Larry . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't believe that douchebag is ranked # 1 again . '' said Ty , `` I mean , have you ever actually seen the guy do anything ? '' <newline> <newline> `` He sits all day in that damn pizza joint downtown eating and drinking . '' she said . `` Wait , I take that back , it ca n't be *all day* because he only wakes up at 2:00 pm . '' <newline> <newline> `` Last time , the asshole did n't even bother changing out of his pajamas . And did you *smell* the guy ? I mean who the hell smells like that ? '' said Ty disgusted . <newline> <newline> `` Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? '' asked Nickolette . <newline> <newline> `` We can take him Nicky . '' said Ty looking over at Nickolette . `` With your telekinesis , and my super strength , we could just walk right into that goddamn pizza joint and just take him down to chinatown . '' <newline> <newline> `` He 'd never even know what hit him . '' she said with a whimsical look in her eye . <newline> <newline> *One hour later at Zak 's Pizza and Wings ... * <newline> <newline> `` Oh shit , that 's hilarious ! '' said Nickolette as she reached over and squeezed Larry 's arm at the bar . <newline> <newline> Ty sat on the other side of Larry and downed his second pint of beer as he slapped Larry on the back . <newline> <newline> `` Jesus that 's some funny shit man , you are just too cool . '' he said to the overweight man with the shaggy unkempt hair , still in his bathrobe . <newline> <newline> A man with a grimy , white shirt and loose fitting necktie approached the patrons at the bar . <newline> <newline> `` Hey guys , sorry the pizza is taking so long . I do n't know what 's got into the cooks lately . '' he said to them . <newline> <newline> `` Ah , no worries mate . '' said Larry , `` We 're in no hurry , take your time . Have another round on me guys ! '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're too much Larry . '' said Nickolette . <newline> <newline> `` You know , '' Ty began , `` my head is a little foggy but I feel like there 's something we are forgetting . Like there was a reason we came down here . '' <newline> <newline> `` Must not have been too important , eh ? '' said Nickolette turning her attention back toward Larry , `` So what 's up with you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh , I 'm not sure what you mean love . '' Larry was feeling a bit creeped out at the way she was looking at him . <newline> <newline> `` You know , '' she was now slurring her speech , `` why are you constantly ranked # 1 ? It does n't even look like you 've had anything tweaked . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , '' Larry was often reluctant to talk about it , but threw caution to the wind , `` I dabbled around with genetic enhancement , but gave up after the results came back from the lab . '' <newline> <newline> `` What results ? '' asked Ty . <newline> <newline> `` After a few sessions , my body began to emit massive amounts of THC into the environment around me . '' said Larry . <newline> <newline> `` What ? Holy shit , that explains so much ! '' said Nickolette . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , `` said Larry , `` I thought about going back and tried to get them to reverse it , but ... well ... you know , the THC . '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly Nickolette changed the subject , `` I got an idea ! '' she said . `` Let 's go bowling ! '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

6,"For a moment our eyes met . He did n't show any sign of recognition . Of course he did n't . He just looked the other way and kept walking , like he always did . <newline> <newline> `` Anyway , this guy is practically invisible . I looked all over for him - or her - and I do n't even have a trace yet . Former # 3 knew something but whatever it was , it 's gone now with her . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't know who was on the other side of that phone call , but it did n't matter to me at this moment . Jessica was dead , police declared her case an accident . Truth was , this man , who grabbed her number for himself , chased her into a corner . Deep-frying her own brain was her way out , I assumed . I blamed myself for dragging her into my mess , it was selfish of me to let her remember . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know ... # 1 is a phantom . Name , powers , appearance , heck even age and gender , this person could be ... '' <newline> <newline> He looked around . I forced myself not to grin . His paranoia was getting to him . He feared # 1 , just like everyone did . It was n't me he was afraid of . After all , I was right there and he did n't even notice , did n't even recognize my existence for more than a brief passing moment . No , he was afraid of the phantom , # 1 , the most powerful of all . He had joined the hunt and was now too deep in to back out , yet he was not a single step closer . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry ... I 'm starting to lose my cool . '' He wiped his brow . `` I 'm fine . I can do this . We 'll find him and kill him . '' <newline> <newline> He was walking faster now , away from the crowds . I trailed behind , pretending to be more interested in the pavement . I briefly looked over my shoulder . No one else was following behind . No one had their eyes fixed on me . <newline> <newline> `` # 3 was a recluse , but try to find out if she had family or ... close friends . Maybe she told someone something important . Any detail is enough . '' there was a brief silence . He laughed joylessly . `` You think I 'm afraid of you at this point ? I 'm only helping you now because I want this to be over with . So shut up and get to work . '' <newline> <newline> He ended the call and slipped the phone into his pocket . Now was the time . <newline> <newline> `` Excuse me . '' He just looked at me briefly and waved me away . What , did he think I was handing out flyers or something ? Sure , I did n't look like much but that was just plain rude . I cleared my throat . `` Excuse me . # 3 ? '' He froze . When he whirled around , I could already feel the pressure building . <newline> <newline> `` Who are you ! ? '' <newline> <newline> I took a quick breath . This was risky . Even when he did n't know who I was , as long as he could see me , I could be dead at any moment . <newline> <newline> `` # 1 . '' His face spoke more words than his mouth did all evening . I could read from his expression that he did n't know whether to believe me , while at the same time he contemplated killing me on the spot . `` I do n't appreciate your recent actions . Just thought I 'd tell you . '' <newline> <newline> His face twisted into a mad grin . `` Fool ! Was that all it took ! ? You 're done now ! '' His brow was covered in sweat . He was n't as sure of himself than he wanted me to think . The surrounding air grew thin and heated . `` Dry up and die you -- '' <newline> <newline> I calmly sidestepped behind the corner beside me , making him stop mid-sentence . Facing him like that had been a terrible idea . I stepped back out after the air had cleared . Putting on my favourite accent , I stepped towards # 3 , who look mildly confused at best . <newline> <newline> `` Ey , you okay , man ? `` , I inquired . <newline> <newline> `` What ? ... Leave me be ... '' He grumbled and turned away , back on his track . It only took me two attempts to hit the right spot in his neck . The knife sank in deep and a few moments later , he was dead . The Roman numeral on his neck vanished . I went through his pockets to grab the phone and left . <newline> <newline> *Calling Cal* was all it said on the screen when I redialed . <newline> <newline> `` What is it now , Tom ? '' <newline> <newline> `` # 2 ? '' I could n't help but grin to myself . `` You do n't remember me but I have a bone to pick with you . ''

6,"Anice toiled laboriously . Sweat dripped from his brow as he completed a futile autopsy . His mind was reeling . His hands were bloody . As he contemplated the report he was to write upon completion of his task , the finer points began to form in his mind . He consulted a massive volume on a nearby table , and flipped through the table of contents . He grunted a sigh of relief as he found the perfect section : telekinetics . The pencil in the neck of the woman on the table could have easily been thown by a telekinetic 's mental arm . If this was the case , he or she must have been a strong one , probably in the top two hundred . He scrawled his speculation on a notepad , containing all the possibilities of this particular murder . Later , Anice 's scribblings would be hastily compiled into a formal report and turned over to the enforcement committee , who would investigate , track down the killer , and not only present them with their new rank but also some form of penalization . Depending on the nature and motive of the killing , the punishment could range anywhere from a mere fine and a slap on the wrist to a full-blown execution . Killing simply for the rank , contrary to the morals of those unblessed with powers , was a perfectly acceptable reason for murder in Cannanburough . The population was large and still steadily rising , due to those with infinite charm and unbelievable fertility . He mulled this old train of thought over once again while he carefully removed the seems of the number 5 patch from the sleave of the woman 's coat and placed it in a plastic baggie to be attached to the report . The bronze number brought a sinister smile to Anice 's face , and he turned his attention to the number 1 patch sewn tightly on his own trench coat . He brushed one of his long , curly black hairs from the side of the patch . Anice was employed by the lesser branches of the government , granting him optional complete privacy of his rank and power , for protective purposes . Anice was VERY talented at what he did , in more ways than one . At the time of his hiring , his rank was somewhere in the tenthousands , signaling both a benign power and a pacifistic spirit . His credentials checked out , so they hired him on the spot . He has n't spoken to another human being face-to-face since . He lived in total solitude , crouching his small flat attached to the morgue he occupied . The bodies were delivered in droves to a large freezer room attached to his workspace . He electronically locked the outside door to this freezer before ever leaving the privacy of his room . No-one in the city was even vaguely aware of his rank . Sometimes , the brighter ones would somehow find out and infiltrate his space , as the previous number 1 had when he realized the dangerous power contained in Anice 's mind , completely unrelated to his supernatural gift . Anice remembered the day clearly ... <newline> <newline> ... Number 1 , cloaked in shadows stood over Anice 's bed with a shadowy dagger . He approached , totally intent on ending Anice 's life long before he could lose his own . He sunk the knife into the shape curled on the bed and recoiled in horror when his knife only struck the cotton filling of a pillow under the blankets . Fooled ! By such a childish trick , nonetheless . He attempted to turn when he realized his error but it was far too late . Anice 's hand slowly fell on his shoulder , and Number 1 fell to the floor , totally still and unbreathing . The paralysis Anice was capable of was thorough , all the way to the heart . He could retract it any time he pleased , by sweeping his hand over the open eyes of his victims . Not before he had his fun though ... <newline> <newline> ... Number one lay unmoving on the cold steel table . Anice stood over him , as he was destined to do to many top tens seeking to hold his title for the rest of his life ; He greedily twirled his scalpel , admiring the crossing lines of blood and scarred flesh criss-crossing Number 1 's chest and face . He fawned over the shadowy nubs where Number 1 's limbs and genitals had been . He sang smooth jazz as he finally ended the life of the former most dangerous man in the city , and rolled his own eyes back into his head . The climax of murder surpassed the most divine ecstasy his life had offered before he took his job . He had held his pitiful rank until this day , and felt exalted glory as he replaced his patch with the Number 1 . This was he dreamed of , a way to keep a fresh supply of kills forever , as assassins came to claim his rank . His employers were none the wiser . All the high ranks kept to themselves , to avoid unnecessary danger . No one ever knew who the current Number 1 was . Anice later went on to collect every top ten patch , sending all others to any citizen who could kill without knowing , and thus would n't question the new rank . He was a genius , he was deluded , and he never lost his title in all the ninety-seven years he lived . Most of all , he was death .

6,"The vast doors of my mansion opened wide , and a man in a royal gown entered the room . For a fleeting moment , I showed a slight smile , but it faded before he could see it . He , however , could not hold back his expression , full of furious rage . He had just taken a few steps in before he yelled out : `` Vantalana , how can you do this to me ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Number Two , are you dissatisfied with me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Stop f*cking with me V , you know what this has cost me . '' <newline> <newline> I was glad I could contain my smile , for the bored expression I was showing antagonized him further . `` So what are you going to do about it . '' That was when I suddenly started to pay attention to him . Anyone with any common sense could tell I was baiting him , but Henry Gothaul was too angry to notice . He was falling right into my trap . <newline> <newline> `` I challenge you , '' he pointed his finger glaringly at me . It took a remarkable amount of will to not snicker in return , `` to a duel ! '' *Gotcha ! * Even he noticed the smile that spread across my lips . <newline> <newline> `` Really ? '' I rolled my head to the side , obnoxiously , `` Number 2 thinks he can beat Number 1 ? '' His face lit up bright red with fury ; Number 2 could be so childish sometimes ! <newline> <newline> `` Why you scum ! '' He could barely keep himself from trying to kill me right then and there , but he could n't . He left the room loudly stomping . <newline> <newline> Are you confused ? Let me explain : In this city half of the population is gifted random powers , such as telekinesis , sensors , etc , but the rest of the population who do not are called 'muggles ' , and serve those privileged with power . The Privileged live in a tournament . They are ranked based on their powers , and anyone can challenge a higher rank to a duel to the death to obtain their rank . I am Number One . <newline> <newline> No one knows my power , because the duels take place in a sealed arena . Two people go in , one comes out . Those who survive the Arena say it changes for every fight , to best mediate each competitor 's power . Even the sizes of the Arena change , in spite of the laws of physics , and survivors talk about 2km wide deserts , and 400m wide urban brawls . It 's all rather interesting , but no one is known to have found a way to cheat this system , at least not yet . <newline> <newline> The familiar doors of the Arena stood before me . I remember dozens of battles , in dozens of environments . I remind myself of my plan , and smile knowing that Number Two had lost the battle the moment he took my bait . <newline> <newline> Henry stood in front of the massive gates of the Arena . He had slain many a foe inside of its walls , and thought about the glorious combat to come . His body ached in rage towards that snake of a woman ! He would crush her and take his rightful place as Number One ! The only reason she was Number One and he was not was an agreement they had made , that she would keep his daughter 's power secret . He knew that he was lost , that he was obsessed with the Arena and that he would die in it some day , but he did not want to curse his daughter with the same fate . And yet that b*tch failed him ! She convinced his daughter to fight for her , and now she would die ! The doors opened , and he shouted his battlecry at the top of his lungs : `` FOR LUCY ! '' <newline> <newline> Inside the arena was a small town . It seemed about a kilometer on each side , with a rural town dominating the center of the field . In the very center of town was an old church , which sounded its bells . In each corner was a small patch of woods , perfect places to hide in . As the doors closed behind him , he began to teleport wildly , searching for the infernal woman . He teleported , and there- there she was ! What was she doing , just standing on top of the steeple ! Surely this was some sort of trick , it was in her nature to deceive . He waited for something to happen , but she did not move . To h*ll with this ! If he did nothing , he would never figure out her power ! He had to probe her . He teleported behind One , swung with his battlehammer , and- nothing . It passed through her body with no resistance , and she faded away . A hologram ! He immediately teleported away . So that 's her power- holograms ! Still , it 's remarkably similar to Number 4 's illusions . But then again , it 's not unheard of for two people to have the same power , and One seemed like she 'd be much better that Four with them anyway . As he had anticipated , though , she did not have an offensive power . She may be able to deceive him , but all he had to do was make sure that none of the holograms got close , for she would have to do so to kill him ! He stood up , a terrifying smile spreading across his face , ready to hunt down Number One . <newline> <newline> Cont . in reply

6,"I remember this day with a mixture of fondness and horror . It was a rather average , slightly cloudy day when it began , the news reporters on jumbotrons reporting the accident . “ Emmett Dodson , the number 1 for over 20 years , has passed from a stroke. ” The streets suddenly descended in a frenzy as everyone checked their phones , seeing their number ascend one or two digits . <newline> <newline> “ Number 4 , 863 , ” my closest friend , Johnathan said , gleaming at his phone , showing me the screen . “ So excited ! ” I tried to convince the boy to calm down , but his giddiness was a like a forest fire , unable to extinguished . Only after what seemed like a lifetime , did he calm down , asking me to check my own rank . Turning on my phone to only appease my friend , I begin to go through my apps . Probably still in 5,000s , I thought . I hadn ’ t discovered my power , unlike most of the members of my family . <newline> <newline> My father was number 312 , a mid-level empathic , the golden child of his family , being the first to achieve a rank above 1,000 . With the ability to push certain emotions into people ’ s mind , his suggestions were a contributing factor to his survival as a child in his small town . My mother on the other hand , was a low level memorizer , number 5,443 , only able to garner a person ’ s attention for a single moment before shockwaves of pain would course through her head . <newline> <newline> “ He is probably still in the 5,000s , ” Lilly mused , the bassist of our band . Her instrument was strapped across her back , her forgetfulness causing her to misplace her music case . Out of the four of us , she and I were the only ones that still held our instruments , for my mother was late in dropping me off at John ’ s house . <newline> <newline> “ Oh , well what are you , Lilly ? ” Michael , our drummer asked , a wolfish smile on his face . Lilly ’ s face instantly become red , her eyes looking downwards as she mumbled a number in the 8,000s . <newline> <newline> I finally found the app on my phone , quickly tapping it with my right thumb . LOADING.LOADING.LOADING… . Hurry the hell up , you dumb phone . LOADING . LOADING . LOADING… NUMBER 1 . <newline> <newline> I instantly felt my heart fold in on itself , my blood beginning to race . Number 1 ? That ’ s not possible . I violently bit my teeth , attempting to stifle my amazement . <newline> <newline> “ What was it ? ! ” John asked , his eyes wide with hope . “ Still in the 5,000s ? ” At my nod , his excitement simmered away . “ Well , it ’ s alright , man . Next time. ” He gave me a gentle pat on the back , completely catching me by surprise . My bite on my tongue loosened , a small trickle of blood leaving the small space between my lips . <newline> <newline> “ Man , you ’ re bleeding all over your clothes and instrument ! ” Michael hollered , catching my case right as I let the handle go . “ Ahh , all over your white shirt , ” he groaned . <newline> <newline> “ I just bit my tongue , ” I said . “ I ’ m fine , honestly ... ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re so disgusting , mate , ” Lilly sighed , suddenly walking off . With a sigh , Michael handed me my guitar case as he went running after Lilly , her fast legs allowing her to already take a corner . <newline> <newline> “ Hey , lets get some water to rinse out your mouth. ” John grabbed me by the hand , pulling me towards the gas station across the street . “ Gim me a minute , ” he said as he walked into the store . <newline> <newline> I waited patiently , using the sleeve of my jacket to clean the outside of my case , worried that my blood might have gotten into the case . I flicked open the latches , relieved at the sight of a clean guitar . <newline> <newline> As I was about to latch it close , I saw a well-dressed man striding towards me , his large hands reaching . Before I knew it , he had hold of me , our surrounding swiftly shifting to what seemed like the middle of an alleyway . Before I could take in my surroundings , I saw the man pull a gleam of silver from his coat , raising it high . <newline> <newline> In a bout of fright , I jerked back , barely evading the blade ’ s kiss , clumsily tripping over my guitar case . Regaining my composure as I hit the ground , I grabbed at the nearest object I could see , my guitar barely hanging out of my case . Gripping the neck , I put the guitar in front of me , ready to fight for my life . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the man stopping in mid-stride , his face becoming a scarlet red . A stream of blood came from his ears , staining his white-collared shirt . In half a breath , the man collapsed , his face landing in a grimy puddle . In my amazement , I scuffled away from the dead man , my back hitting the alleyway ’ s walls . <newline> <newline> I released the hold of my guitar , letting it drop to the ground . Bringing my knees to my chest , I held myself , the faint sound of nearby music suddenly becoming apparent to me . I gazed down at my instrument , eyes falling upon its strings . At the neck of my guitar , a few drops of my own blood stained the strings a crimson red . <newline>

6,"1 : ‘ So , you want an interview ? I can imagine . Do you think your report will give me a good light ? ’ <newline> <newline> I ( Interviewer ) : ‘ No matter what you say , people will want to hear your story . No one knew what happened to # 1 , and then you show up 20 years after she disappeared . Can you tell us about how you were able to kill her ? She ’ s in the records as one of the most powerful . Invulnerability set her apart to many in the game , and she helped to bring some lawfulness to the system . Then , one day , she was gone . # 2 was searching for her or the person who may have killed her for 10 years. ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ Should I start at the beginning ? ’ <newline> <newline> i : ‘ Sure . I 've got as long as you do ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ If you knew how long that was , you ’ d want me to hurry up then . <newline> <newline> ‘ I was raised by my dad . He was # 4 , until 2 tracked him down . That was when I was 18 . My dad could see the future . Not in years mind you , but he could see about 20 minutes ahead of time almost exactly . So he was able to move up the ranks just purely by playing the odds and surviving . Then # 1 , as you mentioned , brought some order to the chaos and by that time the top 10,000 or so had already killed themselves , and he topped out . Anyway , my dad , I don ’ t want to say he didn ’ t love me , but he never let me enjoy life . We were always on the run , always moving . I never had a single friend growing up . But , when a person is ranked as high as he was , and he clearly didn ’ t deserve to be based on how small his power is , he didn ’ t have much choice but to be on the run. ’ <newline> <newline> i : ‘ Why did 2 kill your dad ? ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ I think he figured out I was 1 by that time , and he almost caught up to me . But my dad made himself a decoy . 2 knew he couldn ’ t kill 1 while she was still alive , but as soon as he found out I killed her , he knew he could be 1 as soon as he found me . Certain people naturally have an advantage over others . That ’ s why 2 was never going any higher while 1 was still alive . It doesn ’ t matter how much damage you do to someone who is externally impervious , you ’ ll never harm them . I think 2 believed all along that 1 had been killed , and that ’ s why he sent out the search parties . He told everyone it was because of how important she was , but really it was because he thought he might finally be able to get it . <newline> <newline> So when he discovered who I was , and who my father was , he stopped at nothing to kill me . And yes , everyone knows it ’ s against the rules now , but there ’ s almost no one who can stop him is there. ’ <newline> <newline> i : ‘ And that ’ s why you asked me here to tell your story , so everyone knows about you before 2 tries to kill you ? ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ Partially . I don ’ t stand a chance against 2 on my own . I assume he ’ s confident in that as well . And if he catches me when I ’ m not ready , he ’ ll kill me very quickly. ’ <newline> <newline> i : ‘ Tell me quickly about your abilities. ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ I ’ m able to access a person ’ s abilities and weaknesses just by looking at them . Even over a TV screen in most cases . It ’ s interesting , because I often know more about people than they do , yet for most of my life I ’ ve spoken to almost no one . I believe it ’ s a variation of my dad , he could see the future and understand it . I can see people and understand them . It ’ s not the most powerful ability , but it helps keep me alive , and when my dad and I were still together , we could almost be unbeatable . Not unstoppable , but unbeatable. ’ <newline> <newline> i : ‘ Is that how you and your dad killed 1 ? ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ No . I killed her long before that . See , and this was purely accidental , but she was externally invulnerable . But , internally , she was more fragile than most people . Too fragile to care a baby full term . My dad did n't know that until it was too late . 20 minutes vs 9 months . So , I was born ranked 1 , and dad knew everyone would kill me for a chance at that ranking , even if t was illegal. ’ <newline> <newline> i : ‘ That ’ s tragic . And here you are telling your story before 2 finds and kills you . What are you going to do next , go back into hiding and hope to avoid him ? ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ There ’ s no avoiding 2 . I suspect he ’ ll be here shortly . I called the capital after you arrived and told them of my location. ’ <newline> <newline> i : ‘ So this is it , your letting 2 kill you today ? ’ <newline> <newline> 1 : ‘ You don ’ t understand . I needed you here when he arrived , as you are the only person I know who can kill him . So , my question to you is , would you like to be my # 2 ? ’ <newline>

6,"So I know this is both late and perhaps not as concise as it could be . But I got carried away . <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> Second <newline> <newline> <newline> As I left , I heard Wallace call out , “ Do n't forget your necklace , sir. ” I thanked him and left , and for a moment my thoughts remained with the man who had been a servant in the house of the Second for as long as I had been there – and possible through the previous tenant 's time there , too . <newline> <newline> The gold necklace had been a gift from the Archduke of the Downs , back when I was a child and the Downs had an Archduke . One summer his territory had been overrun by stray dogs , which at times clogged the narrow alleys , and every night let loose such a yawing and bellowing that no one got a night 's rest for miles . I had been a ratty child then , living in the alleys and surviving on the scraps the dogs brought be from overfull dumpsters and whatever they could steal from tables and taverns . The Archduke , a self-styled ruler whose conquest would have been more impressive had it been bigger , or in any way desirable , had heard word of me from his personal guard who patrolled the uneven streets at night and had caught the occasional glimpse of my dirty face running with the dogs through the back streets . I was brought before the Archduke , in tattered clothes and looking , no doubt , more like a dog than a boy , and had thought to impress me by transmuting my dirty shirt into a gold necklace . He had drawn me , with the promise of food and shelter , into his service , which began with my persuading the rampant wild dogs to go elsewhere . And I had , entering the minds of the creatures and urging them *go on , there 's food there , far away* . To my credit , I had felt shame at sending away the very creatures who had fed me , and kept me safe . But the Archduke 's promises of steady food and shelter dry in rain and warm in winter were too enticing . <newline> <newline> Today , hardly anyone would look at me and know me for the ratty dog boy from the Downs . I had n't lived there in years , and my clothes spoke of the importance of my station . Now , whenever anyone looked at me , I knew their thoughts : *Second* . Even if I could n't sink into their minds as I could a dog 's , their thoughts were written plain in the widening of their eyes , and the increased pace , and furtive glances when they thought I could n't see . And when they were out of earshot , I could hear , through the ears of their pets , what no one should hear : unfiltered discourse about myself . I knew they did n't know what power I had , why I was Second or how I had persuaded the previous Second to abdicate his position . They suspected a hidden well of energy upon which I could draw , or a strength or speed that I hid within my slight body . The previous Second , a polyglot with the unique ability to cause anyone he wished to speak in a different language , had owned a small terrier called Whimsy , who he kept at his side at all times , as a sort of good luck charm . It had been Whimsy , after all , who had first so entranced the child of Sirius Hempsy , governor extraordinaire , and brought him to the attention of the people who would later see to it that he helped write the treaty that allowed for the peaceful annexation of several suburbs into the city limits . It had also been Whimsy who saw Sirius with the boy , and heard the boy 's whimpers . I had simply been one of the many folk who stopped to pet the terrier and whisper encouraging words into the Second 's ear . <newline> <newline> The night I confronted him , he simply left the city , conferring to me the title of Second without a struggle . The only peculiarity was his knife , which he wore always on his belt . It could have come from the Middle Ages , and was , I guessed , a boning knife , although I was n't sure . He 'd run his hand along its length as though it was a lover , and then set it carefully on the counter of his high-rise apartment and walked out . <newline> <newline> Reflexively , my hand went to my hip and felt for the cool bone handle of the knife . I had begun to carry it with me , as a sort of trophy . My own good luck charm , along with the late Archduke 's necklace , still hanging around my neck . I thought I might need it tonight . <newline> <newline> The Second 's position was precarious . At the apex of a mountain of skilled individuals , the position was coveted by many , for many reasons . Some wanted the recognition , and some simply felt they should have what they deserved . For the past few days , I had heard , beneath the braying and the barking , the thoughts of a pomeranian who lived in the French quarter . More accurately , I had heard , through his ears , the braying of a man who lived near a bridge , and told every passerby of a boy he 'd known , a boy who could talk to dogs , and who now lived downtown and lorded over us all . <newline> <newline> I was going to stop him . My knife would stop the braying . <newline> <newline> I had , somehow , come to a park . I did n't remember the journey there , but there I was . I looked around me and found the bridge from the dog 's mind , much smaller to my human eyes . It crossed a gentle stream that I guessed would empty into the river that cut through the city 's center . The moon was high , and - <newline> <newline> Something was not right . The hairs on the back of my neck rose to attention , and I walked towards the bridge , trying for a calm appearance . I had the sudden urge to turn around , but <newline> <newline> **keep walking** <newline> <newline> something inside of me suggested . My hand went to the bone knife , but I kept walking . The hairs on my neck were frozen out , as though by static . I felt my heart beating in my throat , and the took a deep breath to calm myself . The pomeranian , I knew . I closed my eyes briefly and saw myself , through the dog 's eyes . It was behind me , watching me . *Stay* I told it , and it did n't move , just watched . I kept walking , trying to ignore the growing feeling of dread within me . My hand gripped the bone knife painfully . <newline> <newline> **Stop walking** <newline> <newline> something suggested . I did . It was the last mistake I ever made .

6,"“ Wow that was awesome ! Do it again Sarah ! ” I shouted with glee . Sarah showed her perfect teeth as she saw how entertained I was . Her gaze was concentrated towards the fireworks that lay planted in the ground a few yards in front of her . Moments later , fireworks of all colors were bursting in the air . “ Whooo ! That was better than the last one ! ” She gave me a wink and I tried not to blush . Besides the firework display she put on , you could tell she had powers . On the back of both of her hands displayed a number . The number 2 ’ s were glowing a bright red , which stylishly matched her fire red hair . She was a Pyro . I ’ m not sure if it was her looks that attracted me or her powers . I mean don ’ t get me wrong , she was HOT . What ’ s not to like about a cute redhead with freckles and a petite frame ? But fire . I was in love with fire and she knew my weakness for it . Every time we met up she would always display her powers for me . Like a magician putting on a show for a mesmerized child . She would juggle fireballs , jumprope with an enflamed rope , she even lit her hands on fire and took my hands into hers . I was freaked out to say the least , but for some odd reason it didn ’ t burn me . There was no heat to any of her fire . I snapped back to reality . “ Man… you ’ re really lucky ” I said as I stared at the nakedness on the back of my hands . My smile had turned into a slight frown . I was just a regular human being . “ Lucky ? ” Sarah responded as if insulted . “ I would do anything to be normal… ” She showed the back of her hands to me . “ I ’ m marked . I ’ m an outcast . I can ’ t hide these stupid numbers . I ’ ve tried everything to cover them up . Makeup , gloves , the numbers just burn right through . And having these on your hand is the least of your worries . I can ’ t even make friends or live a normal life . And you know you ’ d be in deep trouble if your family or other Normals knew you were hanging out with me . There ’ s no place for me , not even within my own kind. ” I could see her eyes start to water . “ People like me . People with powers . They kill eachother . And for what ? To “ level up ” and become number 1 ? There is no normal Christmas for me , no birthday celebrations , no high school career . Trust me , you do not want this life Michael . I live in a chaotic world much different from yours ! ” At this point she was shouting and her face was covered in tears . I rushed to her and took her hands in mine feeling the warm glow of her numbers . “ I ’ m sorry Sarah I didn ’ t mean it. ” I wrapped my arms around her shivering body trying to calm her . “ Normal or not , you ’ re my best friend. ” At the back of my mind I couldn ’ t help but wonder how she got the number 2 on her hands , but I definitely wasn ’ t going to ask . <newline> <newline> It was getting dark and that meant Sarah had to go back to the city where she lived . If she stayed in the suburbs at night her glowing numbers would show like floodlights . It wasn ’ t exactly illegal for her to be here , but no Normal I knew liked her kind . “ I have to go. ” Sarah said sniffling and wiping the snot from her nose . <newline> <newline> “ Let me walk you. ” <newline> <newline> “ You know it ’ s not safe for you to come to the city. ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ll just walk you to the outskirts. ” I smiled trying to convince her . <newline> <newline> “ Okay fine. ” She said softly with a smile . It was about 6 miles that separated her world from mine . I put my arm over her shoulder and we started walking . <newline> <newline> I slowed to a stop and turned to Sarah . “ Well…I guess this is goodnight ? ” You could see the city alive behind us . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , I guess so. ” <newline> <newline> “ No more tears okay ? ” <newline> <newline> “ No more tears ” she smiled slightly . Then tiptoed and kissed me on my cheek , right at the corner of my lips . I blushed hard , but thanked the night for concealing it . “ See you tomorrow ” she gave me a tight hug and started to walk away , her shining hands swaying in the night . <newline> <newline> Moments later I heard an incredible bang that echoed towards the sky . I turned to the direction it came from , towards Sarah . Her small silhouette dropped to the ground . “ Sarah ! ” I cried rushing towards her . “ M-Michael… ” I crouched to her and held her in my arms . “ Shh don ’ t talk . You ’ re going to be okay Sarah ! ” Blood gushed from her chest . “ Help me ! Someone help ! ” I shouted at the top of my lungs . The red 2 ’ s on Sarah ’ s hands started to go dim . “ Please Sarah , don ’ t leave me ! ” I held her head to my chest rocking back and forth . I could barely see Sarah ’ s beautiful face through my teary eyes . “ I ’ m sorry…I ’ m sorry I lied to you Michael ” she said with her last breath and closed her eyes . My tears fell on her freckled face . <newline> <newline> Then I heard the footsteps . They stopped right above me and Sarah . “ Hehehe…been eyeing Number 2 for quite some time kid. ” I looked up to see a man with a nasty grin on his unshaven face . A glowing 3 on the back of his hand . And where his other hand was supposed to be was a six shooter , with a glowing 3 that reflected light off its metallic surface . My attention was drawn back to Sarah , as the light on her 2 ’ s finally gave into the night . And that ’ s when it happened . “ Ooooh yeah baby , haven ’ t felt that in a looong time ! ” The man said with a rusty laugh while changing his piece back into a normal hand . The 3 ’ s on his hands morphed into the brighter 2 ’ s that Sarah once had . But something even brighter appeared , almost blindingly at first . I looked down and put Sarah ’ s frail body down gently . “ What the hell ? ! ” The man shouted . I slowly stood up still observing my hands . Bright 1 ’ s glowed deeply on my hands . My hands illuminated with a dark aura . I clenched them into fists and raised my head . <newline>

But today , he has agreed to have an interview with us and show light to some of his mysterious life ! Please welcome to the stage , Mr James Smith ! `` ** <newline> <newline> It never got old , the sensation of people clapping , welcoming me onto the stage .

'' <newline> <newline> ** '' Yes I see . You were the only person out of the top 10 who never gave any interviews on live TV before ? I always though that 's the reason why you were kept at Number 1 spot , never giving your information away , so i want to ask , why did you decide to give come to the show and potentially give your rivals the chance to defeat you ? `` ** <newline> <newline> `` Well , first of all , i think this as a big gigantic game , where the winners get to live , and losers die , and the reason why I did n't give interviews were , quite frankly , i could n't be bothered , and that 's the only reason . But like all games , if you keep winning , you get bored very fast right ? that 's why i 'm here , i got too bored of the current situation and want to spice things up . i really could care about by rank , you can challenge me if you want , and i hope you do whoever watching this .

'' <newline> <newline> ** '' i see , so then , i 'm guessing that your power is n't offensive type then , since you do n't train for it and do n't use them to hunt others down , am i right ? `` ** <newline> <newline> `` yes '' <newline> <newline> ** '' then do you have any idea why that you are number 1 ? i mean , everyone in top 10 except for you all have offensive type power , there 's one that can set things on fire , one that can manipulate your body to whatever , and let 's not forget Number two , the `` Sonic '' who can cause massive pressure wave that will kill you in an instant . `` ** <newline> <newline> `` first of all , honestly , i do n't know how he can be Number 2 with that kind of power , it 's quite laughable . and secondly , i seriously do n't know , i 'm actually surprised my self that i survived this long without getting stabbed , or burned , or thrown off the cliff . i really do n't know .

6,"The Nine Kings were a sort of urban legend . Eight powerful enigmas uniting under a truce to lord their power over the people with Number 1 . The higher your rank , the more political influence you had over the city , and even the world . <newline> <newline> Take Mason , a red-headed hothead with eyes of amber , for example . Mason was ranked 9,001 . Only the top 10,000 get to live in Paradiso , a city for only the strongest on the planet . Imagine his shock when Number 10 came to him with a deal : work together to take down Number 1 , and live off the royalties as the Ten Kings . Mason immediately accepted . Sure , he was wealthy enough , but you do n't get to live in Paradiso without being a little greedy . <newline> <newline> Mason and Tenner , the name number 10 chose for himself , discussed their powers and plans for weeks . Mason could create fire , and Tenner could copy bullets , giving himself endless ammunition . However , Number 1 's power was a mystery . No one knew what he could do . All that was known was that he was an assassin who used his victims ' decapitated heads as proof of his victories . <newline> <newline> After weeks of scouting , Mason and Tenner arrived at Number 1 's beach house . The night was cold . Mason 's body radiated heat , so his toned upper body was bare . Tenner , on the other hand , was bundled in a black jacket . A scarf covered his face , and goggles with orange lenses hid his eyes . He never revealed his face , even to Mason . <newline> <newline> `` Are you ready ? '' Mason asked Tenner . His heavily garbed friend nodded . `` I 'll lead the way , '' he answered . `` Watch my back . '' <newline> <newline> The two walked into the house , ready for anything . They needed to do this quickly , lest the other Kings decide to crash the party . What Mason and Tenner were n't ready for was finding the house already trashed . A man in a white t-shirt stood over a decapitated corpse filled with kitchen knives . As the knives disappeared , the man turned to greet his other two guests . His hair was a chilling black , and his eyes were silver . He was the complete opposite of Mason . `` Thieves , '' Number 1 said , `` you ca n't live with 'em , and you ca n't live without 'em . '' <newline> <newline> Tenner pointed both of his revolvers at Number 1 . Mason 's fists conjured scarlet flames . He recognized Number 1 's face from all the internet articles . Mason and Tenner fired upon him , only for the King to evade with ease . He was fast , and his attacks would be faster . Like magic , the single kitchen knife in his hand became three , and he threw them at Mason and Tenner . <newline> <newline> The two expertly dodged , while Number 1 slashed open a window , and jumped outside . Mason and Tenner pursued him , the former using his flames to propel himself . Red lights and white flashes reflected over the ocean that night . <newline> <newline> Number 1 tossed a knife at the airborne Mason , only have it to turn into a hundred mid-flight . Mason blew them all away , and Tenner got a shot on Number 1 's left shoulder . This did n't stop the King , who he kept throwing and multiplying knives . Neither Mason nor Tenner could get close enough to deal the finishing blow . <newline> <newline> Number 1 used the fight 's confusion to circle back to his beach house . Tenner had to magically reload his pistols , meaning it was up to Mason to stop Number 1 from contacting the other Kings . <newline> <newline> Number 1 burst through his front door , while Mason created his own opening by burning a large hole in the ceiling . `` I 'm gon na enjoy this , '' Mason gloated as he sent a geyser of flame toward Number 1 . The King burned alive . His flesh seared away by the raw force of Mason 's fire . Number 1 screamed until there was nothing left of him but a charred corpse . <newline> <newline> Mason sat on a nearby couch . It was his couch , now . He was Number 1 . Tenner soon walked in , and assessed the damage . `` How 's it feel , Mason ? '' he asked the pyrokinetic . Mason smiled . `` To be Number 1 ? Pretty good . Of course , I prefer to stay Number 1 . '' Before Tenner could fire at Mason , he set aflame by his partner . Mason watched as Tenner fell to the ground , his clothes falling to pieces . Mason closed his eyes , and enjoyed the sound of the night ocean 's tide . <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> `` Seven , '' a voice said . <newline> <newline> Mason opened his eyes , and turned around . Number 1 stood next to the hole in the wall , wearing a denim jacket instead of his t-shirt . Mason got up to fight him , only to have his arms stabbed by kitchen knives thrown from opposite directions . As he cried out in pain , two more people emerged from the shadows . They were both Number 1 's , only one wore a hoodie , and another wore a business suit . <newline> <newline> `` Like I was saying , '' the first Number 1 spoke , `` the man you killed was Number 7 , which means you 're Number 7 , now . '' Before Mason could speak , the third Number 1 punched him in the face , causing the pyrokinetic to fall to the ground . `` H-how ? '' Mason uttered . <newline> <newline> The three Number 1s smiled . Six more entered the room , each one wearing something different . One of them being the Number 1 Mason killed . `` Cloning 's one of the most practical powers I 've ever seen , '' Number 7 explained . `` Being to the top , on the other hand , can be boring , '' Number 3 added . `` Once you 're there , there 's no one you can trust , '' Number 8 said . `` But it 's not about the destination , '' Number 4 said . `` It 's about the journey . '' <newline> <newline> Number 1 , the real Number 1 in the denim jacket , created two naked clones of himself . `` I had so much fun killing to get here , I decided to do it again , and again , and again . '' He picked up a scrap of wood from the floor , and duplicated it in his hand . `` However , I decided to give each iteration of me a different fighting style to accomplish this . Knives , bullets , shuriken , pipes , myself ... I can clone just about anything . Take that corpse . '' He pointed to the thief 's corpse on the ground , which disappeared . `` That was me , too . '' <newline> <newline> Mason slowly stood up . `` Wait , did you say 'bullets ? ' '' he asked . As Number 1 nodded , Mason was shot in the back of the head by Tenner . Tenner removed his scarf and goggles , revealing Number 1 's face . `` Should we take his head with the rest ? '' Number 10 asked . Number 1 shook his head . `` No , you can destroy it . I prefer not showing off the heads of zeroes . '' <newline> <newline> With that , the clones each took part in the sadistic ritual of shooting and stabbing Mason 's head into oblivion .

6,"I 'd had my eye on him for some time . My third eye , that is . It 's a crazy town -- pyros , cryos , time-shifters , teleporters -- but no matter how flashy they look , the only thing that threatens a telepath is another telepath . Eran Vitas . I knew his name , I knew his age , I knew how many ice cubes he put in his tea . And I knew , most important of all , that the only information he had about me was a number . <newline> <newline> `` Number one . '' He held a familiar severed head in his hand , dangling lifeless by a tangle of dark hair . Eran clearly thought that this entitled him to a new rank . So be it . <newline> <newline> `` Eight , '' I replied curtly . I could feel him teasing at the edges of my mind , probing for any sign of weakness . I grinned . `` You 've made a big name for yourself . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm about to make a bigger one , '' said Eran . Incredible ! I could n't help but laugh . He looked strong , sounded strong , *felt* strong inside my head . There was a sharp sensation as he slipped into my memory , like plucking out a hair . `` The old Eight was a friend of yours , '' he said , processing what he 'd learned . `` I wonder , did he protect your secrets out of loyalty ? Or was he ... . *more* than just a bodyguard ? '' <newline> <newline> I played the role , but I could see he had n't done his research . Trying to ruffle my feathers with infidelities ? The poor fool . Brave though . `` And just what do you know about my secrets ? '' I asked , after what seemed an appropriate pause . <newline> <newline> The fingers in my mind squeezed . **Come now , sister of mine . ** His voice drowned out my thoughts . **I sensed you the minute I came to this city . ** He dropped the head on the floor and kicked it . **He betrayed you , long before his last breath . Told me you were psychic -- as if I did n't know . Your lover was just as useless a traitor as he was a guard dog . But do n't worry . ** He drew his sword , staring that stare , speaking with closed lips -- **You can ask him all about it in hell . ** <newline> <newline> It was hard to keep him out of my head much longer . I could feel him , like fingernails digging into my flesh . Electric . Alive . Dangerous . My smile went flat . He was good . `` Close the door . '' It was a command , but it came out like a request . <newline> <newline> He sneered , letting his inhuman eyes track down my neck and over my body . It did n't take a telepath to read his thoughts . `` That wo n't save you , '' he warned . <newline> <newline> `` Indulge me . '' He probed harder . I let him think he was winning . Warily , he backed towards the temple door and slid it shut . We were alone now , enclosed by paper walls and lit by candles . `` You know you should be careful with that , '' I warned him . He smirked and twirled his blade , pacing towards me with practiced martial steps . `` With your mind , '' I explained . `` Once they know what you are , it 's only a matter of time . '' <newline> <newline> **Is that why you hide in your temple ? ** He loomed forwards , patiently , taking his time . He thought he was enjoying this . <newline> <newline> **Stop that , ** I chided . The game was up ; everyone outside saw what they needed to see , and now that the duel had officially begun in secret , there was no reason to keep playing . I brushed his mental fingers aside . He had seemed so strong -- but he was n't . The shock on his face , in that moment of realization , was at once picturesque and disappointing . In the moment I had hoped for so much more ; but I knew . <newline> <newline> `` Everybody knows I 'm a telepath , '' I explained . Those confident steps of his were moving backwards now , shaking at the knees . I stood from my throne and advanced towards him . `` They all suspect it , which means they all know it . Which means I *want* them to know it . '' **The secret is what I can DO with it . ** <newline> <newline> Evidently , Eran had not encountered this sort of assault before . He had his fingers on my mind , and I was elbow-deep in his soul . I plucked emotions like strings . He laughed , he screamed , his eyes went wild . He swung his sword like a madman fighting ghosts . He lashed out with his powers -- clawing at me , digging ; but unable to focus . I wanted him to hurt me , but he could n't even do that . I let him scream for a while longer , before I took away his breath . <newline> <newline> He lay on the floor , gasping , too weak to move , a model of abject terror . I put a sandaled foot on his neck , but I let him live . **Here 's a secret : I 've been using telepathy to lie about the numbers , ** I told him , in a tortuous sing-song tone . <newline> <newline> `` You 're not ... . '' he struggled . I let my foot up . `` You 're not ... .. number one ! ! '' <newline> <newline> I sighed . **Is that what you think ? ** I poured catastrophe over his mind , tearing synapses and wreaking havoc , and repeating that phrase , **IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK ! ** over laughter and chaos and death . Eran was gone , but I held him there . His eyes bled , but I made him watch . <newline> <newline> `` No , you sad , pathetic fool . I 've been lying about the numbers ... .. *your* numbers . '' I turned my back on the vegetable , willing the lights to stay on just a little bit longer . `` For example , when you came to this town you thought you were \ # 744 . A lie . Your number had twice as many digits . You understand what I mean by that ? '' He managed to look smaller . `` Then when you came here , to my temple , I called you number eight -- but that was a lie , too . '' I came back to his broken body , and put a hand on his forehead . `` I know , I know . You thought that you killed Eight . But eight ... '' I set the severed head on his chest . Its eyes were red with fire . `` Eight is a regenerator . '' The jaws flew open and screamed with unearthly vigor ; the head threw itself onto Eran 's face , and devoured it , leaving entrails of bone and brains and mush dripping from the hole in his neck . <newline> <newline> When I opened the temple door , I left a bloody handprint on the paper . My dress was caked in gore , and Eight , still without his skin , was indistinguishable from the remains smeared across his gigantic frame . Like two pit demons we walked . The women of the temple screamed at the desecration in our wake . The men averted their eyes , and fell prostrate . I smiled at Eight . `` He was fun . ''
"
6,"I watched , allowing myself to recline into the throne once more . Fourth was interesting ; shivering like an autumn leaf in the breeze with either rage or fear . He isn ’ t even sure himself . <newline> <newline> “ Calm yourself , Fourth. ” Hissed Eighth . “ You ’ re inviting death. ” <newline> <newline> “ Calm ? Excuse me , but calm ? ” Fourth ’ s voice was at least an octave higher than usual – a barely suppressed neigh of laughter squeaking out of his throat . “ This madman just killed Third . For no reason whatsoever . And you ’ re telling me , to be calm ? ” <newline> <newline> “ There was a reason. ” I allow my lips to curl into a smile . “ She gazed upon me . Without permission. ” <newline> <newline> “ Do you… do you even hear what he… ” <newline> <newline> “ Silence , Fourth. ” A hauntingly beautiful voice that sent ripples down your spine . Even from up on high , I could sense the aura emanating from Second – a miasma of fear , blood thirst , and excitement that seemed to physically caress the vast throne room . “ Know your place . You have grown complacent in your power . It would be easy for any one of us in this room to replace you . The reason none of us have done so – “ and here , the pressure ceased – “ Is because you , like the rest of us , are under First ’ s protection. ” <newline> <newline> Even Fourth , unstable as he was , understood that he was beaten . Visibly swallowing his words , he returned to his former , kowtowing position – shivering all the time . <newline> <newline> “ And we move on. ” I glance at what had , formerly , been Third . “ Fourth . Take Third away . And use the moment to cool your head. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes , First. ” He ’ s shaking , internally . But I have to give him some credit . He does a pretty good job of covering it up . Only Me , Second , and possibly Ninth could have discerned it . <newline> <newline> And now , to more serious matters . <newline> <newline> “ Seeing as how Fourth is currently occupied . Fifth , give your report. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes , First. ” <newline> <newline> And the meeting continues . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> I should have seen it coming . Really , that was an odd failure . Perhaps I had let it happen . <newline> <newline> With a crash , Fourth brought my throne crashing down . <newline> <newline> “ Your reign of terror is over , First. ” Second ’ s face is completely calm – a reflection , I would suppose , of my own face . “ We know what your power is , now. ” <newline> <newline> For the first time , I find myself standing on the same level as Second . Not only Second . Fourth , Fifth , and Sixth… all the way up to Twelfth . They have me surrounded . <newline> <newline> And it fills me with anger . <newline> <newline> “ How dare you. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , First. ” Fourth ’ s protest is uncharacteristically serene . “ How dare you . You style yourself as the God-King of this city , and enslave everyone to your will - and even your most trusted generals must bow and scrape to you . Third – poor Third. ” A crack appears in that perfect mask of calm . “ You killed her , for bloody looking at you . I just… I just thought you were ruthless , but at that moment , I realized . You are mad , First. ” <newline> <newline> A chorus of murmurs spreads throughout the circle . Murmurs of approval . Of agreement . Of the idiotic vermin of the city . <newline> <newline> They disgust me so . <newline> <newline> “ Have you any last words ? Former First. ” Twelfth is cackling now . He was always so eager to please . <newline> <newline> “ Come at me , vermin. ” <newline> <newline> Oddly enough , no one takes the initiative . They all stand still , staring at me without moving so much as a muscle . <newline> <newline> For the first time in my life , I was confused . “ What ? ” <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> “ What ? ” <newline> <newline> Second was right , I thought . She ’ s finally nailed down First ’ s power . The one that eluded us all . <newline> <newline> First can only reflect abilities back at people . He himself has no real gifts . <newline> <newline> With that thought in mind , I grin as I take out the flipblade . Crude - but all the more fitting for this occasion . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> `` How odd . '' <newline> <newline> With a snap of my fingers , I send them all crashing into different corners of the room . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> I was flung backwards . What was that … telekinesis . Third ? ! <newline> <newline> “ Third ! ” I managed to choke out the words before I collapsed into a fit of coughs . A blurred , shadowy figure strolled through the dust towards me . Third . <newline> <newline> When I finally got up again , First stood right in front of me . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> “ Third ! ” Fourth managed , coughing all the while . <newline> <newline> How sad for them . Clinging on to such trivial things . <newline> <newline> “ Third is dead . You , of all people , should know that well. ” <newline> <newline> “ But… but how ? ” I could almost smile as he gets into a halfhearted boxing stance . Fourth was always a fighter . A fighter to his very end , it would seem . <newline> <newline> “ Haven ’ t you realized by now ? What my power truly is ? ” I pause , now . For dramatic effect . <newline> <newline> Fourth , however , was far too uncultured to appreciate the pause . Instead , he used the opportunity to take a swing at my face . <newline> <newline> I let it smash against my face – and I enjoy Fourth ’ s look of horror as he recoiled , cradling the remnants of his right hand . <newline> <newline> “ I am the Source , Fourth. ” I smile as Fourth gritted his teeth . “ Haven ’ t you ever wondered where your powers came from ? Or did you really think that they just fell out of the sky ? That you were born with them because you were luckier ? <newline> <newline> “ The only one here who is superior , ” I continue , snapping Fourth ’ s limbs one by one , “ Is me . I am , as you say , the God of this city . I am the God because I give the powers . <newline> <newline> “ But no more . Ungrateful curs , the lot of you. ” I sigh , mostly for dramatic effect – after all , I have no need to breathe . “ I think I ’ ll wipe the Earth clean of your kind . You sicken me . Every last one of you. ” <newline> <newline> With a swipe of my hand , I ended Fourth . So too , with the rest of the Earth .

6,"You know the saying , 'It 's lonely at the top '' ? That 's a load of bull . Whoever thought it was lonely at the top has never been to the top . The top is crowded as all get out ! The problem is that they all want you dead . That does n't sound like very much fun , does it ? Well , trust me , it is n't . Still , I would n't trade it for anything in the world . <newline> <newline> I , like everyone else like me , live in the city of Potentia . It was founded barely twenty years ago , when the first supers began to appear . It was designed to be a place for everyone with special/unnatural abilities could live without fear of discrimination , and the rest of humanity could live without fear of *us . * Set smack in the middle of the New Mexican Desert , it 's almost as if a city the size of Milwaukee were magically teleported into the middle of nowhere . Considering the abilities some of the city 's residents have , I would n't be surprised if that actually happened . If I 'm remembering my history correctly , it was one of the last acts of President Barack Obama to have the city built , after his third and final term… I 'm rambling , are n't I ? Sorry , I should get to the point . Potentia was founded twenty years ago , and I was born the same year all the super powered beings moved/relocated . <newline> <newline> Potentia is all I 've ever known . Travel in and out of the city is minimal . `` Regulars , '' other than the military , almost never come through . Twenty years and the fear still is n't gone . And unless you accept a contract with the military , usually some weird type of experiments , `` Supers '' are discouraged from leaving . So , as far as I 've known or cared , Potentia is the entire world for me . <newline> <newline> It was n't long until it became the whole world to everyone else , too . Honestly , I 'm surprised things stayed as good as they did for so long . So many people , so many different variations of power , it was a powder keg just waiting to go off . Well , when I was twelve , that 's exactly what happened . I have no idea what started it , but suddenly we all just started… killing each other . At first it was a free-for-all , but after a few weeks gangs began to form . There were the telekinetics , the flyers , the Strongmen , if you were n't in `` X '' gang , you were the enemy , basically . And the people who stayed out of the gangs ? Well , they were everybody 's enemy . The outside world either did n't know or did n't care . As long as we fought each other , we were n't a threat to them ! <newline> <newline> Well , soon after the gangs formed , the fights for territory began in earnest . The street I lived on became the front lines of a battle between a gang of people with heat-vision , and an up-and-coming band of lightning-casters . My dad had joined the heat-vision gang , mostly for the protection it would give us , and he died in the first day of fighting . My mother , the only Regular I had ever known in my life , was executed by the lighting-casters after they finally pushed the heat-vision gang off the street . I barely managed to escape with my life . I killed for the first time when I was only twelve , in that fight for my life . The lighting-casters just had n't expected my abilities . <newline> <newline> If I had to pick a moment I began climbing the ladder , it would probably be that one . It was partially by accident . I scrounged around on the streets for about two years , picking pockets and stealing food . Then I began earning some extra cash by buying , selling , and stealing information to and from gangs . Every now and then someone would come after me , learning that it was me who tipped off the target they were going after about the impending attack . I tried to avoid killing… at first . Eventually I had ticked off enough people it became inevitable . <newline> <newline> It was in one of those fights , when I was about sixteen , that I began my climb for real . An entire gang came after me , one night . Twenty men and women with super-strength , all wanting to crush me into dust . I killed them all in five minutes . I had taken a few baby steps to power by accident , becoming an information broker purely out of necessity . It was then , standing over twenty bodies , that I realized my true potential . <newline> <newline> My climb after that was , to say the least , meteoritic . I never had a gang to help me , partially because no one else in Potentia has my powers . Also , I had no need for them . Looking back at it , four years later , I must have just come out of nowhere to all the former warlords of this city . Me , only sixteen at the time , declaring war on *all* the gangs of Potentia ? I would have laughed , too , if I were in their position . <newline> <newline> I started small , picking off members of the tiny , weaker gangs one by one . I began to build a small reputation . `` Legion , '' people began to whisper , because they assumed it would have to be a legion of Supers that could be doing all of this . After the weaker gangs were picked off , I worked on gaining territory of my own . I took my old street back from the lighting-casters , who had recently been weakened by losing a gang war with a band of telekinetics . I moved street by street after that . Sometimes I even went as slow as building by building ! Eventually , I had a quarter of the city under my control . The people who lived under my domain paid protection money , not because I threatened them , but because they were glad to be rid of the gangs . <newline> <newline> I kept expanding . Piece by piece , bite by bite I hacked away at the rest of Potentia . The other gangs , the *real* , powerful para-militias of the city , had finally taken notice . In a move that even I did n't expect , they set aside their rivalries to take out the `` Legion '' threat . Almost two years of war came after that . Thousands had to have died . Entire buildings collapsed , armies of hundreds stormed streets under my protection . If the outside world cared about us at all , military historians could have spent decades studying this war . <newline> <newline> In all those two years , though , I never backed down , I never lost an inch of ground that my feet touched . Centimeter by centimeter , the gangs were losing power . They began to sense it , too , near the end . Soon they began fighting each other . In that last year of war , I barely had to do anything ! They destroyed themselves for me . <newline> <newline> When all was said and done and the dust had settled , there I was . I stood atop Potentia , sole ruler of my tiny world . What remained of the once unstoppable gangs came crawling to me . I accepted them under my banner , solely as a police force . The gangland days of the city were over . <newline> <newline> How did I do it , you may ask ? Well , to this day people are still asking . I 've never used my powers in public , and when I have there were no survivors . I 'll give you a hint , though . My power is what made me so good as an information broker , it 's what helped me fight a war without an army , a mob boss without a mob . It 's also how I 've survived multiple assassination attempts , so far . I 'm everywhere at once , when I want to me . Call me Legion , for that 's what I am . <newline> <newline> And so , here I am at the top . Twenty years old and I 've been everything from a street urchin , to an information broker , to a general , to a mayor/president of Potentia . I do n't think I 'm done , though . It may be time to… expand the city limits , if you catch my drift .

6,"Henri walked into his newly rented apartment and set his suit case in the bedroom . He surveyed the rest of the apartment , noting the tasteful but obviously cheap Ikea furniture . He took out his laptop and travel mug and set them on the kitchen table . Unable to find a kettle , he put some water in a cooking pot and set it on the stove to boil for tea . <newline> <newline> His laptop had finished booting up . He did a quick search of the city ’ s municipal website for the highest ranked super . He never understood why America had such a ladder system in place but that law had been passed by the new President , who had killed the old one right in his own office after making short work of his equally superpowered security detail . No one else since had come close to being a challenge for her . <newline> <newline> Leaders in other levels of government were not as confident in their abilities . Skirmishes happened everyday as those who craved power and dominance tried to take it or defend it . <newline> <newline> The European countries were wiser and held contests rather than sanctioning outright murder . Henri himself had risen to rule several countries before being bested . He decided to try his skill in America . A small city should be no problem . <newline> <newline> Maybe Henri would try his luck some day at presidency , but that day was not today . He filled his travel mug with hot water and loose tea leaves and began his daily training . He took a wooden box from his suitcase and cleared a space in the living room area . He opened the box , revealing eight metal spheres within . <newline> <newline> He relaxed his mind and flexed his mental muscles . The spheres rose a foot into the air . Henri moved them up and down and spun them in intricate patterns around each other . While still moving them he split them , dividing them into smaller and smaller spheres until it looked like he was manipulating a river of molten metal . <newline> <newline> He stopped the undulating mercurial mass with his will and began reconstituting them until he had his original eight . Starting from the left , he divided them again , this time separating them into their molecular components . Then he began combining them , using his will to control the powerful chemical reactions with the elements in the air and each other until he had the entire table of elements before him . He recombined them back into his original eight mundane metal spheres and sat down to enjoy his tea . <newline> <newline> “ I am coming for you. ” He said , jabbing a finger at the picture of the city mayor on his laptop screen . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Early the next morning Henri made his way to city hall . He approached the receptionist desk and waited politely for the telekinetic to put down his phone , coffee , finish signing for a package and typing before announcing his purpose . “ I have an appointment with the mayor. ” He said . He caught something in the receptionist ’ s eye when he said that . Fear , perhaps ? * “ You should fear me. ” * Henri thought . * “ I will be your new ruler soon. ” * <newline> <newline> “ Of course. ” The receptionist said with a pleasant smile . “ Please fill out this form and go up to the fifth floor. ” <newline> <newline> Henri groaned mentally and rushed through the paperwork , filling whatever sparse details he chose to reveal and made up the rest . <newline> <newline> On the fifth floor he followed the signs pointing the way to the mayor ’ s office . He was about to push open the double doors when the left one opened from the inside and an attractive brunette in her twenties stepped out with a big smile on her face . She was wearing a skin tight combat suit with an assortment of bladed weapons strapped all over her body . The girl continued down the hall , oblivious to Henri . <newline> <newline> He entered room , mentally lifting his metal spheres out of his suit jacket as he walked . He split one into a multitude of arrowheads , second into magnesium flashbangs and pulled a small sphere of white phosphorous from another . He created water from the surrounding air and mentally kept a layer of it around the chemical bomb . The man behind the desk looked up at him . <newline> <newline> “ You must be Henri. ” He said , smiling , putting down a small knife he had been playing with . <newline> <newline> “ Yes. ” Henri said , the mayor ’ s amiable attitude throwing him off a little bit . <newline> <newline> “ Please have a seat. ” The mayor said , gesturing to the chairs in front of his desk and the lounge set near the window , letting Henri pick which he preferred . “ I know you ’ ve come a long way. ” <newline> <newline> Henri ’ s eyes narrowed in suspicion . Most people weren ’ t so accommodating to their killers . What was this man up to ? <newline> <newline> “ Would you like a drink ? ” The mayor stood and walked to the lounge set where a minibar was set up just beside the window . <newline> <newline> Henri regarded the man ’ s slight stature . He was nearly fifteen centimeters shorter than himself and looked like he could barely weigh sixty-five kilos soaking wet . Nevertheless , physical attributes were not a sure indication of super ability . <newline> <newline> “ Drink , Henri ? ” the mayor asked again , raising the bottle of spirit . <newline> <newline> “ No , thank you. ” Henri replied , his own amiability catching himself off guard . A knot of fear grew in his stomach . * “ What is going on ? ” * <newline> <newline> The mayor finished his drink and approached him , stopping about half a meter away . “ Henri , I know why you ’ re here and I know you ’ re not going to kill me. ” <newline> <newline> * “ Why would I kill you ? ” * The knot in his stomach was fading away . He felt something washing over his mind , clearing away his normal cold , calculating demeanor and replacing it with something lighter . <newline> <newline> “ Why would you kill me ? ” the mayor continued , echoing Henri ’ s thoughts . “ We ’ ve been friends for years ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Heh , heh , heh , heh. ” Henri chuckled at the absurdity of the situation . “ I ’ m not here to kill you. ” Henri said , getting closer to his old friend and wrapping his arm around his shoulder . “ This ? ” he said , gesturing to his weapons . “ This is like when we were back in university ! ” <newline> <newline> Henri made his arrowheads spin like tops while he controlled small burning phosphorous rings around them . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah ! ” the mayor replied energetically and nodding his head . “ I remember , you came over and did cool stuff like this all the time ! ” <newline> <newline> The two watched Henri ’ s amazing talent for a while before the mayor broke the silence . “ Henri , its great seeing you again but I have a serious favour to ask you. ” <newline> <newline> Henri stopped his chemical manipulations and returned the spheres to their original state . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m planning to run for the presidency . Can I count on your support ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Of course. ” Henri said . “ Anything you need. ” <newline> <newline> “ Great ! I knew I could count on you ! ” the mayor said with a big smile . <newline> <newline> “ Well , I won ’ t take up any more of your time. ” Henri said , putting his spheres back into his pockets . He paused as he put the last one away and handed it to his friend instead . “ Here . I ’ d like you to have this as a reminder of simpler times. ” <newline> <newline> The mayor took it gratefully . “ Thank you , Henri . You are one of my best friends. ” <newline> <newline> Henri left his friend ’ s office with a smile on his face . It was good to catch up again . The years fly by so fast . The elevator doors opened and a large man stepped out . He was armoured in plate with a helm over his head and had a large sword sheathed at this side . Glowing blue eyes stared down at Henri . <newline> <newline> Henri stepped in as the infernal knight stepped out , oblivious to any social faux pas he may have committed . He went straight home to wait for his friend ’ s call . <newline> <newline>

6,"I have n't written anything in years but love reading these Writing Prompts . This one got me wanting to make an attempt at writing again . <newline> <newline> Blood slowly trickled out to the wound and into the ever expanding pool surrounding the mans head . He was laying on his back on the hard city ground in an alley , he would look like a drunken man who had staggered into the alley and fallen asleep if you could ignore the fact he had a knife in his eye . <newline> <newline> He was the first person to come after me in a long time and for the life of me I can ’ t even remember his name nor the speech he gave . Its all bullshit in the long run . These powers these numbers all they have lead to was a bloodbath that still continues even after countless innocent and Numbered , as those without powers call them behind their back , lost their lives . <newline> <newline> Moving forward slowly I crouch before the nameless man and pick up my knife . Rolling him onto his side I lift up his shirt and see a red 2 that is slowly fading on his arm . Surprised I mutter “ It ’ s been years since a top ten has decided to die by my hands. ” That ’ s when I hear a small scuffle of boots . <newline> <newline> My gaze raises and I see a swarm of people I had failed to notice deeper into the alley . It seems 2 here had brought his whole gang with him . Darkness covers their true numbers but it doesn ’ t matter . Lifting my head I simply say “ Boo ” and they scatter like the sheep they are . <newline> <newline> Ten years . Ten years since Numbers came to be and utter mayhem consumed this city and I lost everything I cared about . <newline> <newline> I woke up that morning on April 15th and noticed a giant red 35000 on my arm . In all my years I ’ ve never heard of a number lower . It took days for people to sort out that those of us with red numbers on our arms were special . That those of us marked could things that couldn ’ t be explained . <newline> <newline> The Numbered tried to take over the city , starting fights with police and politicians . Declaring parts of the city theirs and killing those who stood up against them . The fighting got so bad that entire city blocks are still rubble even ten years later . The worst of the damage was caused after the Numbered realized that if they killed someone with a higher number then they had that they would gain that number . <newline> <newline> Ten years ago I had taken my fiancé to the mall to take a look at wedding bands . The fighting wasn ’ t bad to start out with and people still cared to go to crowded places like a mall . My number was still in the 30000 ’ s then . Not a day goes by that I don ’ t weep in despair and wish I could go back in time and change things . <newline> <newline> After we had looked at wedding bands we had gone to the food court to get something to eat . We took a seat at the edge of the food court so we could watch the people skating below . While eating a store window shattered and a man was thrown into the middle of the ice rink . He was wearing a giant trench coat , besides the clothes being ripped he looked fine when he stood up . Another man , this one completely naked , appeared walking over shards of glass and metal towards the man in the trench coat . <newline> <newline> I didn ’ t know their names then but I do know them now . It was Number 1 who had dubbed himself Iron Death and was said to be invulnerable with super human strength and the ability to turn anything he touched into Iron . The man who threw him through the store front was Number 3 who had called himself Firebringer . He had the ability to turn himself into fire and shoot fireballs from his hands , It was also rumored he could fly . <newline> <newline> Most people ran trying to get away from the fighting but a few stayed to watch awestruck . My fiancé was one of them . The fighting was short but intense . Firebringer had enveloped himself in flames and ran straight toward Iron Death shooting fireballs at him the whole time . Iron Death punched the ground and grabbed two giant chucks of rubble turned them into iron and merely waited . <newline> <newline> Iron Death swung one iron chunk then the other trying to smash into Firebringer but they seemed to go right through him as if Firebringer wasn ’ t just enveloped in flames but had turned himself into actual fire . In rage Iron Death tossed the chunks away and tried to grab some part of Firebringer with his hands . <newline> <newline> One of those chunks of iron that was tossed away headed straight towards myself and my fiancé . The chunk was moving too fast for either one of us to do anything but watch and it struck her right in the chest ripping threw her as easily as if she was made of paper . I screamed in anguish and cradled her limp bloody body in my arms “ Elizabeth. ” I cried her name and over again my body shaking with grief . <newline> <newline> After a period of time that seemed an eternity chuckling could be heard from below us and a rage unlike anything I ’ ve ever felt before came over me . I stood and looked over the edge of the food court and looked down upon the man chuckling . It was Firebringer standing over a blackened corpse with smoke rising from it . On his arm his 3 had been replaced by a 1 . <newline> <newline> I slowly walked towards the escalator and down them to the first floor . My vision had turned to red and a rage unlike anything I ’ ve experienced before or since came over me . Any rational thought I might have had was burned away . I walked down the escalator towards where the new Number 1 was . <newline> <newline> Not thinking about what I was doing I picked up the nearest object , which was a discarded skate , and chucked it at him . It didn ’ t even come close to hitting him , just landed a few feet away with a thunk . I picked up another skate and tried to chuck it at Firebringer again but this time his hand came up and he shot two fireballs out . One to burn the skate the other to burn me . <newline> <newline> Everything seemed to stop as the fireball was about the reach me . I looked around in amazement and noticed the fireball was stuck in the air inches from me . The next thing that became apparent was that there was no sound anywhere . <newline> <newline> Walking forward I noticed the skate hanging in the middle of the air burning but the fire wasn ’ t moving . Approaching Firebringer he was completely motionless with a smile and a laugh still on his lips . Not sure what was happening I walked around him before tripping on a long thin poker of iron that must have been made by Iron Death . Picking it up I moved back towards Firebringer ’ s face and placed it before his eye . <newline> I tried to push it in but couldn ’ t . I held it there for a few minutes trying to bring myself to kill this monster . Again and again I tried end his life but my hands just wouldn ’ t move forward . Crying to myself I apologized to Elizabeth and to everyone that I didn ’ t have the strength to avenge her , I just couldn ’ t kill a person no matter what . <newline> <newline> My head eventually gazed up at where I knew her body lay and I saw her limp wrist dangling over the edge . My anger sprouted up anew and I shoved the iron poker through Firebringer ’ s eye and straight into his brain . I took my hands off the iron and backed away just watching as it just stand there embedded in Firebringer ’ s eye watching amazed that I had done it and wondering why no blood was coming out of the wound . Then without warning everything seemed to snap out of its frozen state and Firebringer ’ s body fell to the floor to lie atop Iron Deaths . I felt a familiar tingling on my arm that indicated my number was changing , I didn ’ t have to look at it to see that I was the cities new Number 1 . <newline> Since Elizabeth died and I took over as the new Number 1 attempts have been made on my life many times . Everyone I ’ ve known or loved has been killed because they were either with me or they were taken hostage and killed to try to lure me out or killed in retaliation or someone I had killed . <newline> <newline> No one knows what I can do and it has led to a lot of theories and more attempts on my life then I can care to count . It ends the same , a number with my knife through their eye and me standing safely away with no one seeing how I did it . <newline>

6,"I can feel the ventilator that keeps my lungs working pump before I hear it hiss , quietly . That ’ s my caretaker who came in to check the IV drips that keep me fed . An unnecessary precaution . I am completely aware of my surroundings and can perform any maintenance on the vast array of machines that sustain my life without assistance , but he knows I appreciate the thought . When I shift my shoulders , one of the last things I have nerve control over , that gurgle is at the pain . I have in thirty-eight years never stopped hurting but taking medication that would dull my mind would leave me vulnerable to assassination , to losing my rank as the most powerful human in this city . <newline> <newline> Oh , don ’ t worry , he couldn ’ t see you – I bent the light around you to keep you hidden . That ’ s a trick I only got down recently . He ’ s not good with guests , even if they are upstanding members of the community like you . I understand you built a successful business from the ground up ? I appreciate that kind of fortitude , that drive . Most people who could teleport would probably make an easier living . Call me old-fashioned . <newline> <newline> You see , I was born in a time before the power rankings even existed , before the meteor showers of 2018 . That was before all the government testing , before the conflict and civil wars . When half the population below 30 began to show signs of special abilities , there was so much hope , then expectation , then fear . If I hadn ’ t been born in rural Canada I doubt I could have survived to adulthood ; I didn ’ t even feel my powers until I was thirteen . It was not until I moved here , once called Chicago , as an older teen that I was even truly aware of what the abilities meant . It ’ s not the only city left with rankings – the other eight major cities on this continent have them too , and they all have someone like me . The other number 1 ’ s , as we are called , leave each other alone . We ’ ve decided , after many decades , to respect our little fiefdoms , and even occasionally speak to each other . No one knows the burden a crown brings besides another king . It is worse when you are so powerful and no-one can know why . <newline> <newline> The reason no one knows what I can do is because I have taken such great pains to keep it secret . I can appear to have almost any ability I choose because I can manipulate matter . I don ’ t mean I can pick up an object and throw it with my mind , I mean I can atomize someone . I have imploded a skyscraper and I have severed the hemispheres of my enemies brains inside their skulls . I will occasionally peel back the layers of my own flesh and draw out my various muscle tissues and veins , peering deeply into the ruined track of offal you could call my nerves . No matter how I try , learning with great patience to shape individual cells and repair strings of tissue , I can not restore function . I can not create life . I feel like a dollmaker , crafting and forming , molding the shape of a man but with no way to animate it but through my own action . Even using stem cells I felt inside my brain stem yielded only minimal results . So I lay , crippled and twisted , in the highest chamber of the tallest remaining building here . <newline> <newline> I can , of course , move myself through my power . My brain functions perfectly through repairs I conduct regularly – touching everything but what I have identified as the seat of my power , a small gland in my frontal lobe . When I was 23 , rank 10,287 , tied up with the great struggle of the power games , a young man at rank 1,673 tried to kill me using bioexplosive compounds he could excrete . I tracked him to a portside warehouse and fell into a trap he laid – the place was covered with the slime . Before I knew what it was , the explosion levelled a city block . Though I kept as much force as I could at bay , my body was shredded . I had so little knowledge then , such poor control . I don ’ t know how I pulled myself back together and forced my body to hover out of there , but I did . <newline> <newline> The next three weeks are a blank – hospitalized , remembering only pain . When I awoke , I realized not only could I not move under my own power , but my mind was different somehow . Before , I could reach out , feel perhaps as far as a few hundred feet away . Now , I saw everything in my head for miles . When I once could make out the rough shapes of large objects and the basic presence of small ones , now I could feel everything . There was no blank space , no simple guesses . I could feel the air around me , observe the workings of the living bodies and explore every miniscule facet of the environment in every direction . It was rapture . It was hell . I nearly went insane from the flood of information I could hardly understand . I also came to realize I had awoken for the last time . I can no longer rest – my brain does not allow it . I became incapable of sleep . <newline> <newline> I hid my consciousness from the doctors and nurses , and started to test my abilities . I did accidentally perform actions before I regained control – instead of moving a vase of flowers , I disintegrated a rough cone of matter around it and flung it across the room . I tried to catch it but instead collapsed a chunk of the wall it was about to hit . It took several days , but I became confident enough in my abilities to try moving my limbs . Within a week , I “ walked ” out of the hospital . I had repaired my face as well as I could but since my previous life had ended it didn ’ t bother me I no longer looked exactly the same . If I was a new man , I would be new entirely – and no one would know what I could do , and the extent of my ability . <newline> <newline> Before I made it a block I saw a listing board for the rankings , scrolling through the low 1,000 ’ s . I wouldn ’ t have stopped or paid it any attention if I didn ’ t see a familiar name at rank 1,002 – the bioexplosive man who had left me crippled . This was a time when the numbers were followed with great interest : many people over rank 5000 would boast their successes , and the media would follow them . There was even someone working at the largest news station in the city who could tell what rank you should be just by meeting you . There were gaps , of course – people like me , either keeping secret or going unnoticed – but I would occasionally check to see where I should have been . <newline> <newline> As my luck would have it , he had appeared on the news recently to take credit for a spectacular beheading of some super-strong brute . I found him , and I found where he lived . I am not , and never have been proud of how I killed him . It has never taken that long since , and I have left the rest of my regrettable opponents… intact , for the most part . It wasn ’ t until then that I heard the crying . This maniac had a baby – couldn ’ t have been more than 2 . It may speak ill of me to kill someone with a kid , but he had took out so many others I couldn ’ t feel remorse . I got the child to a home where it would be cared for , and kept tabs on it for quite a while . The girl turned out alright . Suffice to say , I took his home and made it my own – rent was a fairly flexible concept at that time . <newline> <newline> The city had become a battleground of sorts , regular civic function interspersed with colossal fights . Bands of lower-powered thugs would follow stronger leaders and rule with an iron fist . There were altruists , of course , but they were few and often overpowered by gangs of the violent . As I started rebuilding a life , forcing my body to move normally , appearing unscathed – I began to invest in my abilities . I took to gambling where I would fix the results ; I would steal money through walls and never be caught . I even took to secretly removing powerful gang leaders with high numbers , even wiping out violent groups altogether , and protect the people who were just trying to live peacefully . Neighborhoods became safer , people ran businesses with less fear and many became familiar to me as I helped out where I could . I accumulated wealth and became , on the surface , a model citizen . <newline>

6,"`` I heard he is invisible . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's lame . There 's no way his power is invisibility . John K. would 've destroyed him by now , and he 's not even in the top 10 . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well it 's better than your stupid time lord ideas . Everyone knows that time travel ca n't work . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whatever . Oh hey , did you hear LeBron went off for 60 , the other night . '' <newline> <newline> I 'm only a few feet away from them and I 'm tempted to just tell the two kids that it 's me ; I 'm number one . I 'm right here , ask me anything you want . I 'll tell you my power . I 'll tell you how I killed Alexander the great , with his regretfully obvious and somewhat wrong nickname . Hell , I 'll even tell you my bank pin number . I 'm so tired of this . I just want ... <newline> But it does n't matter . They 've already walked off , and I still have a sandwich to finish . I 've given up on going to restaurants . I do n't even go to fast food anymore . It 's not really worth the hassle . But on the plus side , I 've been eating much healthier . Y'know , it took me a while , but I think I 'm finally embracing a more meditative life style . I 'm sure I couldn ’ t have lasted this long without being a bit introspective . It also helped that I was a late bloomer to powers . I , the great and powerful number one would n't even be sitting here at this park fountain , with an avocado and turkey sandwich if I had to fend for myself in those early years . And once it started , well you know , the chaos of the game kept me alive . It was exciting , it was alluring . It was like I had a voice by being ranked . I saw that for as many people that choose to get a job packing groceries with their small time telekinesis , there are just as many jackasses that think their super saiyan style moves mean anything to the top players . I used to love walking up to those guys , telling them exactly how I ’ m going to kill them , and still they wouldn ’ t even know to stop me . But I 'm tired of that . I 'm tired of being the greatest , and no one respecting that . Now my audience is just these pigeons . I see them watching my every bite of this sandwich . I have their full attention . They are honest friends , and they are always there for me . Damn . This is where I am . The great number one that everyone is searching for . <newline> <newline> `` BOOOOOOMMMMMM ! ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> The fire fell from the sky . My left side is searing with pain . My jacket sleeve has lit up . I throw it on the ground . It lands next to my friends . Former friends . They actually look kind of delicious now . I jump back into the stone fountain . It is no longer a bench for lunch , it is my only cover . My head is barely above the shallow water . My face is pushing against the cool slick side . Pressed hard . I 'm gasping like a rookie . In some ways I am a rookie to this . <newline> 'Do you think you can really call yourself number one ' the voice boomed . <newline> Have they finally found me ? No that ’ s impossible . <newline> 'I can call myself whatever I want . The system is screwing with us . There is no secret number one out there ' a woman barks back . <newline> I ’ m slightly relieved to find it is just Tina and Anil shouting their words at each other . Slightly . I ’ m still stuck though . Seriously , what are the chances that 1 , 2 and 3 would be in the same park ? <newline> <newline> DUN ! DUN ! DUNDUND UNDUNDUN ! ! ! ! <newline> <newline> The fountain shakes . Water is splashing up my nose making it hard to keep this position . I 'm guessing Tina is tearing up the park . A huge rock splashes in the fountain . She is definitely tearing up the park . Two more come down . The second one hits my leg . With a horrible snap it breaks right at the tibia . I need out . I need out now . More fire shoots past . Pain and adrenaline are running through me . <newline> <newline> With a hobbled leg I brace myself up and I yell 'I 'm number one ' . <newline> <newline> Everything is suddenly quiet . Deafeningly quiet . Or it seems that way by contrast . Just heavy breathing and an almost calming crackle of fire fill the air . Each sharp exhale is a punctuation on this stilled sordid scene . Then with a lurch and a loud crack , a burning tree splits and falls to the ground behind me . The eerie calm is broken . <newline> 'I am number one ' I repeat , 'there is no more hiding ' . Really I ’ m only talking as a distraction from the fight ; maybe even to confuse them so I have a chance to slip away . But now I have their full attention . So I keep going . More out of necessity because I 'm nervous about what will happen when I stop . 'To be honest I 'm not really that powerful . It 's just , y'know , the screwed up way they sort numbers . ' I say this as I gingerly try to work my way out of the fountain . I look like the least effectual , most harmless second-rate opponent they could stand against . Yet both of them have their steeled eyes set on me , hardened by their respective violent rises to the top . I have two cocked guns pointed at my head so to speak . 'It 's ok . I just want out of this water . That 's all . ' Neither one speaks . Their unwavering attention says more . 'Anyway , you know the numbers are just ranking how much energy you can manage with your powers , right . It does n't mean the power is that great though . I mean , you could even be the most powerful if you could grow your fingernails really quick if it meant you used a ton of energy , right . Hahaha , could you imagine that . ' They weren ’ t laughing . 'Well I guess I ’ m always using my power on the entire world . And that ’ s all the system really sees . But I 'm not special , I swear I 'm not . ' This is bad . I 've never done this before . I ’ ve always had an escape plan when I started the reveal . But there is no opening to hide . It is not a mistake that these two are ranked second and third . They are calculating every single word I say , and every slight shift I make . When you have dealt with powers long enough you don ’ t take anyone for granted . Especially not someone claiming to be number one without even knowing their power . They know how dangerous an unknown can be . Maybe I have warped their mind . Maybe I ’ m a hologram . A 1k or a 2k would ’ ve already tried to kill me , but not a top 10 . At this point though I was hoping they might survey the scene or something . Just take a little look around , that ’ s all . But they do n't . And I 'm afraid if I tell the truth now I 'll be completely exposed . I need to change tactics . 'Look at that tree behind you ' I say I 'll show you what I can do . ' <newline> Tina speaks first , 'if you do n't tell me what you can do , I will show you what I can do . ' I feel an unnatural force embrace me . Her Darth Vader grip around my neck . My bruised and broken body begins to dangle . Clearly she is no longer worried about my power . She squeezes harder , and with a cough , I manage to choke out the words ‘ Ok ! Ok , ok , ok ... ' . It actually sounds more like ‘ kch , kch kch ’ , but she understood . The death grip loosens just enough on my throat to let me speak . Anil has been unnervingly quiet . But I know they both want the same thing right now . I do n't care anymore . I ’ m such a coward . <newline> 'My power is , well , you will forget me if you lose sight of me even for a second . You will forget everything I have said , everything I have done . Just tie your shoe and I will become nothing once more . I don ’ t matter in your big game . I am ... nothing . ' A wry grin creeps across Tina ’ s face as my words sputter out . If she was a cat her tail would be wagging . I close my eyes as if I could forget myself . I was getting lonely anyway . <newline> <newline> A bright flash of light relentlessly presses on my face . I can see every vein in my eyelids . I embrace the end ... but ... it doesn ’ t come . I crumple to the ground with a thump . What ? <newline> 'Why are you just lying there ? ! ' Anil snaps , ‘ can ’ t you see this place is dangerous ' . Then to himself I hear him mutter 'stupid peasants ' . <newline> 'Sorry sir ' I quickly stammer out , but he has already turned and forgotten me . <newline> I don ’ t know if Anil just accidentally looked away , or if he saw his best chance at number two . I guess it does n't really matter . <newline> <newline> Man , this leg is gon na be a bitch to deal with at the hospital . <newline> <newline>

6,"Son of a bitch earned that kill , that 's for sure . <newline> <newline> I 'm honestly pretty happy with the results though . I was getting bored of my powers anyway ( A small , 5ft8 blond haired blue eyed with the ability to reflect kinetic energy 100 fold ? People were literally punching themselves to death . Too boring for me . Also , my face was kinda half torn off from the previous fight ... Did n't look in a mirror for days ) . But let me tell you about this kid . <newline> <newline> This kid , this young adult , at 6ft4in , long black hair flowing past his shoulders and eyes as dark as coal , had an unsettling intensity about him . He spotted me at the mall arena , where I often sat , observing the lesser combatants and looking for promising prospects . I could feel him watching me from the other side of the arena . <newline> <newline> My eyes met his , those dark coals eyes , devoid of a soul . He need n't have said a word . The small tilt , the slowly emerging smile as he looked at me , it was obvious what was going on . This ... Demon no longer wanted to be the lesser , puny being known as Rank 2 . <newline> <newline> I stood from my throne , and walked toward the arena . He walked towards me , step for step in a perfect line . Those unfortunates who did n't move fast enough out of my way were killed by the sheer force of bumping into me . A sad way to end , right ? <newline> <newline> The arena cleared immediately , those worthless meat sacks knew what was about to go down . Many were smart and cleared the arena as fast as they could , but I honestly do n't think it saved them . We leveled the entire mall , let me tell you that . <newline> <newline> We stood , maybe 20 feet away . No words exchanged , no words needed . Although I wish I knew his name . I guess I was stuck with mine . <newline> <newline> It began . <newline> <newline> He began walking toward me , a slow , confident step , with his arms spread out . I was excited , most filth try to rush me with whatever they have . I reached behind me , into my waistband , pulled out my .50cal handgun with a dead-centered sight , and shot this man square in the face . <newline> <newline> He stopped , surprised at what I had done , as the tangled , hellish barbed wire that instantly appeared from his body destroyed the bullet in mid air . I could see the disappointment in his eyes , knowing he was exposed . I knew all he could see was excitement in mine : Fast deployment , strong , and my god was that barbed wire ever terrifying . Was it already pre-rusted and blood ? Yet it was pure black ... Strange . I wondered if he could control how it looks ... ( Pink Hello Kitty barbed wire anyone ? LOL ) His eyes , brief with ... expression ? immediately returned to normal . Two more barbs emerged from his body and went straight for me , the third flying for the sky in a dark line . <newline> <newline> I laughed openly ; the first two barbs deflected and fired off of me in opposite directions and hit some of the spectators . The third barb came down hard , I watched as it bounced back up towards the skyglass at the top of the mall and just utterly DESTROYED IT man . I laughed harder as , with instantaneous reflexes I can only attribute to a sixth sense , more barbed wire sprang out of him and formed a protective cocoon as the ceiling dropped . Those closest to him were not so lucky . <newline> <newline> I was in love with this man . <newline> <newline> He paused for a second , the cocoon of barb wire returning into his body without a trace . The remaining three blocked my remaining 9 bullets with ease . Killer , right ? This guy was a fucking BOSS . I could hardly contain my excitement . A worthy opponent . <newline> <newline> I discarded my gun , and began walking toward him . He could tell what my power was my now , he knew what I could do . He could n't touch me , and all I had to do was casually flick a rock at myself to cause a subsonic explosive reflection at the closest available target . I had leveled a skyscraper doing that once , it was hilarious . <newline> <newline> I was in front of him now , his dark eyes boring into my blue . I punched my chest , the force ricocheted towards the barb that emerged from his chest and ... stopped . Hmm . The dislocation of barb had no baring on his physical body , and judging by the lack of recoil , the strength was equal to my kinetic reflection . <newline> <newline> I laughed , as I looked into his eyes for the second last time . I felt elated . Beneath those dark , soulless eyes I saw that glimmer of hope , the taste of victory , I heard the breathe of relief . He had figured out what to do . <newline> <newline> Millions of barbs sprang from his body . I remember taking note that too many barbs seemed to cause some sort of energy drain ( Was that blood pouring from him ? Jeez , take better care of yourself buddy ) , they came within millimeters of my body , but did not touch . I was formed in a human outline of barb wire . <newline> <newline> Whelp , this is going to fucking suck . <newline> <newline> The barbs began moving violently against my skin . The force of each reflection blasted the barb against a million other barbs - it had no effect on the sheer strength of them , but my god I could feel it starting . The subsonic explosions were trapped within the miles of barbed wire , and were firing back on me . The vibrations grew quickly , I could feel my bones beginning to break , my head turning to much , my heart exploding from the inside of my body as millions of reflects broke the sound barrier on my body . <newline> <newline> Just to fuck with him one more time , I laughed as hard as I could , as much as I could . Do you have any idea how hard that is to do when your left lung has already exploded , and the right one quickly on it 's way ? It 's fucking hard man . <newline> <newline> I felt the last second of consciousness slip from my body , its insides completely gone . I hoped he would still be alive for this . <newline> <newline> I blinked , and hot damn , I could FEEL taller . Like , wow . All that shit about being able to reach off the top shelf was totally true . <newline> <newline> My arms were spread out , completely open , my mouth ... Almost a real smile of victory . I broke into a goofy grin , and moved the black hair out of my face . <newline> <newline> WOW . Jesus . Miles of barb wire returning into my body feels ... Weird . Like , I feel nothing , but just watching it all retract into you without sensation is pretty odd . <newline> <newline> Hah . There was a metric fuckton of blood on the floor in front of me . In the middle , a broken bundle of human flesh with blond hair lay in front of me . I sighed with relief as I saw it quiver ; he was still alive . <newline> <newline> The one remaining eye left in this sad puddle of flesh registered what had happened , and that shit kicker finally looked like he was experiencing some emotion : Absolute fear . About damn time too , his whole expressionless vibe thing was kinda killing it for me . <newline> <newline> In his last second of life , he realized what I had done . I think he tried to say something , but his mouth was pretty much not intact and non-existent at this point . I squatted down next to him , I knew I only had a second left . <newline> <newline> `` Thanks bud ! '' <newline> <newline> I stood up , and walked away . I knew better than to try and do anything to that puddle , better to just let it die . <newline> <newline> Alright , focus . <newline> <newline> I was new to this , so I only got a hundred or so , but HOT DIGGITY DAMN SON . One hundred barbs fired out of my body in all directions ; I could sense where those alive still were . And sure enough , these barbs fired out , and within a second they were all back , a live , pathetic worm attached to the end of each one , all screaming near me in terror . <newline> <newline> Oh hey , look , the new Rank 2 . Some small , goth-like ( But kinda cute I guess ) girl trying to use a force field of fire , thunder , ice , water , darkness , and whatever other shit to break the barbed wire wrapping around her various body parts . <newline> <newline> I smiled , and felt a flick emanate from my body ; theirs were ripped to shreds . <newline> <newline> SHIT . The mall leveled around me as a result . I felt the barbs spring to life and envelop me protectively . I could hear the mall crumble around me , yet felt nothing . Neat . <newline> <newline> It was over . <newline> <newline> Aww , fuck . I 'm going to have to find a new mall now . This one 's ruined . <newline> <newline> I smiled though , as I walked past the remains of mall and lowly scum . I mean , come on . The next number two is going to have to literally be some kind of fucking GOD to kill me now . <newline> <newline> Just think . Me , a fucking GOD next . I felt a hearty laugh escape my heart and lungs , which I 'm pretty sure terrified the the absolute shit out of anyone who heard it . <newline> <newline> I walked , but did not rush , fantasizing towards my next death . <newline>

6,"It was actually quite a simple one . Any one of these people could defeat me . They just didn ’ t know it . <newline> <newline> Erik had been after my title for years . Had it not been time manipulation , his massive ego could have been a power in itself . Time manipulation was truly unique in the sense that he was Kronos incarnate . Speeding up time , slowing down time and stoping time all fell under the power , so long as the flow of time was forward . Despite the explosions and pure , vile weapons sent after him time and time again , they could never touch him . <newline> <newline> Today was the third time this month that he was challenging me . We stood in the arena , the crowd swallowed in silence . We always squared off and started off with playful banter . Well , playful for me . I think it was going to make him snap some day . <newline> <newline> `` I 've got a new trick this time ! Today 's the day I am crowned number one , you sloth ! ! '' <newline> <newline> Sloth ? Maybe he really did run out of banter . <newline> <newline> `` Are we really going to do this again ? You know you ca n't win , Erik . The crowd knows it ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> With that , they exploded in chants and jeered at Erik , some throwing bits of food that he made seem to phase through him . <newline> <newline> `` Whenever you 're ready , Erik . Just remember , whatever speed you go at , you 'll never be able to hit me . '' <newline> <newline> In a blink , he was in front of me , throwing a punch that went faster than eyes can register , yet his fist flew only inches in front of me . He spun around and kicked at my face , the move also stopping short of a direct hit . One more attempt , a headbutt , coming in close enough for me to see the pores in his head , but no contact . The desperation kicked in giving me my chance . I concluded it with a single punch to the gut . <newline> <newline> I shook my head . <newline> <newline> `` Erik . Please . Give up . I am and always will be the stronger person . '' <newline> <newline> The hit to him hardly inflicted any pain on him , it was the mental drain that made him fall to his knees . The crowd left without much commotion , having seen the scene many times before . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the look on Erik 's face came up again . The epiphany face , as I call it . <newline> <newline> `` Your power . It 's ... it 's manipulation . You can contol people by making them doubt themselves or -- '' <newline> <newline> `` No , it 's not . '' <newline> <newline> The other familiar face , the face of utter confusion , now replaced the former . He got up slowly and walked out mumbling , <newline> <newline> `` Then what is it ? I have to figure it out ... ''

6,"Pacing back and forth in front of me , David paused , one foot half-hovering over the blood-stained carpet . `` Tell me , Kat , what happened ? '' <newline> <newline> The body was sprawled out before us on the black tile floor of the penthouse . Streams of slimy , congealed blood wove intricate rivers in the cracks between the slate pieces , and tiny bits of bone were strewn around like confetti . I did this . I fucking did this . And now I would have to pay . My mouth opened and I took a deep breath . Not knowing what to say next , my lips met once again and I exhaled deeply . My clothes were misted with red droplets . It was on me , on the walls , on the floor , shit , even on the ceiling . <newline> <newline> `` You do realize what this means , right ? '' he questioned again . Taking a single step forward , David 's boot made a sickening crunching sound as it crushed bone fragments into the floor . He winced . <newline> <newline> My brow lowered beyond the brim of my glasses . `` We have to clean it up before anyone finds out ... before anyone knows what I did . Shit ... shit ... shit ... SHIT . '' My hand met my forehead . It felt wet , and when I pulled my palm away , smears of red coated it . <newline> <newline> I was smart . Other people were strong and could lift cars . Some people had telekinesis . Others could will others to do whatever they want . But me ? I was just ... smart . I came here at the request of Rodger , and now I was leaving with a prize I did n't want . I was number one . <newline> <newline> This island was founded as a sort of encampment . Years ago after the war , everyone who had a gift was placed here . They told the founders of this city that it was done to protect the rest of humanity . Alcatraz was a prison back in the early 20th century , but now it was our home—an island full of everyone the rest of the world wanted to put away . History had come full circle . We had numbers that ranked us by how destructive or dangerous our powers could be . It formed a pecking order of sorts . David , my best friend since we had been born , was number thirty . He was a walking torch ; hands so hot that they melted all the testing instruments . All you had to do was piss him off . <newline> <newline> I was just smart . <newline> <newline> The warden . Number one . Prime . The goddamned warden . We were prisoners , and I killed the fucking warden . Sure , he was n't called that by non-specials but that 's exactly what he was . His official title was `` Overseer and Diplomat of the People . '' But it was all the same . Any time the main land wanted to do something or needed to talk with us , he was the go-to . Rodger was his name . He had been our leader for nearly 5 years , by default . The most powerful one always became Prime , and Rodger was undisputed . He easily had twenty times the strength of a normal , could punch through steel like wet paper , and once put down a coup d'etat led by a dozen specials with just his bare hands . But now he was dead , and his twisted , mangled remains rested on the floor in front of me . <newline> <newline> `` Kat , you 're Prime now . You do realize that , right ? '' David nudged my shoulder slightly with two fingers . I could feel a comforting warmth in his fingertips . He was trying to bring me back . I was still woozy , so all I could do is nod slowly . <newline> <newline> This happened because Rodger had tried to turn me into an informant . You see , Prime or not , every leader needs support . Although he was benevolent , people hated him for who and what he was . The man was not just an envoy or a mayor , he was also a symbol of order . Some of the top echelon hated order and wanted to bring anarchy . When I got the call to come to the Warden 's office , I jumped off of the couch and practically ran the whole way there . He was in the leather chair , fingers interwoven . <newline> <newline> `` Kat , '' he said . `` Please , come on in and have a seat . '' My hooded shirt was soaked with sweat from the run and it made a strange squeaking sound against the leather chair as I sat down . `` Thank you for coming . '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's no problem sir . But why did you want to meet with a nobody ... especially me ? I mean , I 'm no one , at least compared to you . I mean , I ca- '' <newline> <newline> He cut me off .

6,"See , when powers came , people were delighted . It was like a kids dream come true – well , ignoring all the murder of course . <newline> When you were born , you would be given a number – that is , if you had powers . Most didn ’ t – only a hundred million did . Still , one seventieth of the world is a lot . <newline> Lots of people who had minor powers . The best power I saw in the ten million up category was someone who could transfer data through his fingers , like a human memory stick . Incredibly useful , though uploading data to his computer was hard if he got distracted – he was in my university class when instead of showing the presentation he ’ d taken , his thoughts of banging the hot girl were projected for the whole class to see , then his idea of running away , the- you get the idea . Could be useful or disastrous , but it was the best I ’ d seen . <newline> <newline> No , what was important here was the fact that when I was born , I was , what , two hundred thousand ? That meant I was in the top one percent ! My parents were delighted , if worried – what if someone came to kill me and steal my rank ? Soon after , they abandoned me in an orphanage , where I was avoided like the plague and barely looked after . I often had to steal food from the kitchens . Of course no one saw me , but we ’ ll get to that later . <newline> At school , I wasn ’ t popular or known . I was quiet , kept to myself . Did my work , did reasonably well and was let out with good enough grades to go to a decent university , and soon afterwards I got a job with a half decent wage . I never got in trouble at my job – even when I arrived late . They never noticed anything I did . <newline> Anyway , leaving out the details of my very boring office life , I decided to take a “ do it yourself test ! ” for ranking one day . I ’ d risen around a hundred thousand places – brilliant , but pointless in the grand scheme of things . Only the top five hundred or so were really well known – godlike beings with powers ranging from control of matter , telepathy , teleportation , the ability to control time… so on . Fun stuff . The stuff that you hear about in greek mythology . <newline> <newline> But it wasn ’ t until I got lost in the woods one day , and came across the number one ranked person in the world . He didn ’ t realize I was there – he was dying . I don ’ t know how it happened , just that his throat was slit with a puddle of blood forming around him . <newline> And well , when that opportunity presents itself , you take a hold of it , right ? I grabbed the nearest rock , and ended his suffering . Crack . I was still lost though . I get lost often , to be honest . Nobody looks for me though . <newline> Anyway . I had one of those tests left to me – and if what people said was right was , indeed , true , then I should be number one . <newline> The test agreed with said people . Number one – I couldn ’ t help but stare at in disbelief for a few moments . And then I wandered off further into the forest , dropping the test somewhere , and managed to learn to survive and build a small cabin for myself . <newline> <newline> And that was it – I saw the news every so often from a radio that ran off of solar power which I stole from some hikers . They did find the number one , but never figured out who finished him off – the teleporter who ’ d left him there had confessed but said he hadn ’ t taken their rank , he wasn ’ t arrested . Conspiracy theorists went wild – what if the number one couldn ’ t die ? Scientists were baffled – was the theory wrong ? <newline> Well , they did try and find a new number one – to see who ’ d finished him off . They found nobody , nothing , not a trace . That was when I figured out what my power was . <newline> <newline> <newline> My power was that I was the loneliest man on earth . Nobody could ever find me unless I found them . Nobody would think about me unless it was something related to me . <newline> <newline> I was alone , and always would be , until one day the new rank one is born – on the day I die . <newline>

6,"Is that Jenny ? *Ohmygod JENNY ! * Like , get your butt over here girl ! <newline> <newline> You will *not believe* the week I 've had ! So like , first off , this guy was looking for me . Talk about a total stalker , he was like , telepathic or whatever , and he was combing the entire fucking city looking for me . I know I 'm like , every guy 's dream and all , but take a number dude . You do n't have to be all *creepy* about it . But like , the thing was that I could like , totally feel him creeping on me from like , a mile away . You know when guys get all handsy at the movies ? Yeah , it was totally like that but in my mind . I pushed him away and like , tried to go home since he had already ruined my night , but the guy was a total perv and started using other peoples ' minds to follow me . Ugh , talk about not taking a hint ! After a while , I just stopped in a park , you know the one with the fountain that Rodney tried to climb that one time when he got really drunk ? Yeah , that one . So like , I waited there and he finally showed up in person . He tried to break into my mind again and force me to like , drown myself ! I do n't remember everything that happened , but like , I do remember getting a distinct urge to like , go under the water and never come up again . I told him that shit was not the proper way to treat a lady . He was straining and glaring at me , but like , I 'm not into guys who look constipated all the time . Anyways , I think he tried too hard and like , broke something in his brain . He just like , fell over ! Someone called 9-1-1 and the paramedics showed up . They asked what happened , but that was drama I *did not want* , so I ducked out of there pretty quick and went home to take a hot bath . <newline> <newline> But that 's not all ! Oh my god Jenny , the next guy was *soooooo hot* ! Like , yeah , he was a total hottie , but I mean he was pyrotechnic or whatever . Somehow , he found out where I lived and set the place on fire ! I had to like , crawl out of the fucking window and scamper down the fire escape ! I 'm just glad I 've been working out because that was a lot of fucking climbing . Anyways , when I got down to the ground , this cutie was there and like , at first I thought he was going to sweep me off my feet like in the movies , but no ! He tried to fucking torch me ! I was *pissed* ! Do n't any of the men around here know how to act around a girl ? Well , you know what they say , if you play with fire , you like , burn out quickly ... or whatever . Yeah , that was totally this guy 's deal . I bet he would n't have lasted very long in bed either . For such a hottie , he was a bigger let down . <newline> <newline> Then , Jenny , and this is the best part , this girl tried to get me next ! I mean like , I 'm not against lesbians or anything , and you know how I get when I , like , drink tequila , but it 's just not my thing under normal circumstances ! Anyways , this girl showed up while I was waiting on the hot ass firefighters to clear my apartment . She started talking to me and I thought she was cool , but she was wearing Uggs . *Uggs* Jenny ! Everyone knows Uggs were cool last winter and so totally uncool now . I tried to like , give her some subtle hints that she needed to find wherever the fire guy ran off to and like , get him to burn those fucking Uggs , but she was dense or something . She just stood there and kept trying to make small talk with me ! Then , the *weirdest* thing happened , Jenny . I started to fall for her . I do n't know what it was , but all of a sudden , like , the Uggs were okay . Then , she started looking really cute . Like , the way her mouth moved was sexy as hell . And like , she had the most beautiful green eyes I had n't even noticed at first . I got so horny all of a sudden that I wanted to kiss her and drag her back into my place to have some fun with the firefighters ! I grabbed her hand and like , started leading her back inside . The elevator was turned off - annoying ! - so we took the stairs . I remember thinking , like , I have n't had any tequila in weeks , not since that night with Danielle - oh my god I need to call her ! Wait , that 's not important right now . Anyways , so I was dragging this girl up the stairs and like , I kept hearing her fucking Uggs slap onto each step . That is a horrible . fucking . sound ! It 's probably the reason everyone started hating them , and it broke me out of whatever spell she had cast on me or whatever . I realized she was manipulating my emotions or whatever , and that shit was not cool . I just turned around all of a sudden and got in her face . She got this look on her face like , `` Oh my god I just fucked up '' , but she did n't have time to react because I fucking pushed her down the stairs . <newline> <newline> I know ! It was harsh . I probably should n't have pushed her like that , especially because she like , snapped her neck . I heard it Jenny ! It was disgusting ! I feel bad about it , but someone should really tell these people that they should n't mess with the person who like , gave them all their powers in the first place ! Right ? !

6,"Everyone wants a power ... .everyone has a power , just many do n't know what to do with them . They cower ; they hide . They think everyone is out to kill them to get a better rank . As if the ranks were like a video game power meter , and each kill was experience points . <newline> <newline> And me ? I ca n't volley for power . I am what everyone else strives to be . Except most of the time , they do n't know it when I 'm right in front of them . A 50-something crippled man in a wheelchair , like I 'm Professor X , except it 's nothing like that . <newline> <newline> I 'm a therapist , I 'm their therapist ; I 'm supposed to be their healer . The low levels come to me for guidance , and for a way to deal with their fears and anxieties . The higher levels are given to me by the authorities and tell me to 'fix ' them and stop them from killing each other . <newline> <newline> In my opinion , it 's just a ploy . Why put all the high ranks in the room with the one person they really want to off ? Because it made for entertainment . For who , I was n't sure . I was always convinced that someone was watching us in sessions . Because many of the high ranks that came in my office did n't come out . <newline> <newline> And today , of all days , I had Number 2 . Which made me giggle as soon as she sat down in front of me . She had a name , of course , Alexa Kovak . All of sixteen years with shock white hair , baggy clothes , and clunky boots . She also had a power : incredible speed . She was a lost kid -- someone who did n't know how to deal with the curse that was bestowed upon them . <newline> <newline> `` Welcome , Alexa . '' I greeted . <newline> <newline> `` Can it , '' she spat . `` You 're a murderer , just like us . Who are you to tell us how the hell to act ? '' <newline> <newline> I gave her a coy smile . `` I do n't kill anyone . '' I told her . She scoff and looked towards the window . Her eyes were looking for blood-stains , body-parts , trophies of my kills . I did n't kill them . They killed themselves by attacking me . <newline> <newline> Even if I could n't read into the future , read her mind , her actions were telegraphed . Her legs were curled up under her , but not comfortably . She was ready to pounce . Her intensive speed made it hard for her to catch , and she would move so fast around her opponent , she would suck the air out of them until they died . <newline> <newline> As soon as I saw her foot twitch , I braced myself . My nails dug into the armrests of my chair , and I squeezed my eyes shut . This girl had no plan , little motive , and a lot of rage . <newline> <newline> When I opened my eyes , she was close enough for me to see the small , silver stud in her nose . I could reach out and press my hand against her cheek . Her skin was soft . In any other life , she would have just been another hormonal teenager . <newline> <newline> It was too bad she was being killed , coincidentally , in the same manner which she happened to kill other people . This was never my intent , but being frozen in time did n't just leave things alone . It paused everything , their breathing included . And I had no choice but to watch . As soon as my body sensed the danger of someone else 's power , it activated . Time stopped in the bubble around us . <newline> <newline> I never figured out how it knew when the threat was neutralized , because I never calmed during the process . Eventually their bodies would just drop to the floor , and I would be left with pain as the power decimated my own body , starting at the toes and working it 's way up . Eventually it would hit my heart ... but I never knew how long that would take . <newline> <newline> No one would ever kill me , but I would continually make the ranks change so long as people kept attacking me . It would only stop when my power killed me . So as long as I was alive , there was a game . <newline>

6,"Number one . The federal registry confirms it . The deference I am shown in the street re-affirms it . Everyone is sure of it… Everyone but me . <newline> <newline> Number one . It doesn ’ t necessarily mean I am the most powerful . Really all it denotes is an ability for survival . In a world which went to sleep powerless and woke up with power unimagined my ability for survival is , to me at least , a complete mystery . <newline> <newline> On the day when IT happened I woke up normally . I got dressed normally . I went to work , reading my paper on the way and not noticing the several thousands of people laughing and flying and… well doing all manner of weird and wonderful things . <newline> <newline> At work I just thought I was early . But no one turned up that day . No one has turned up any day since . I haven ’ t had a job for six years . It ’ s kind of boring really . <newline> <newline> It took probably seventeen seconds for the first realisations of the madness of our time to descend . We were a world of demi-gods of varying degrees of martial power and the problem , the real problem was that the powers that could kill were not necessarily fairly distributed to the , then , authorities . When you are a copper and you wake up with the power to make plants grow fast and the person you are about to arrest for looting woke up with the ability to make someone ’ s head explode with a thought you may be thinking to yourself “ well , that ’ s a bit unfair ” … at least you would think that if you still had anything to think with . <newline> <newline> So chaos descended . There has always been strong people and weak people . Societies developed around them . Status quo was reached by institutionalising violence , by clothing vengeance in the law . All of that had been overturned in a single night . <newline> <newline> So , for a while the strong grew stronger and the ‘ weak ’ just grew meeker until a quasi-feudal system emerged . However just because you have the power to make the tides rise doesn ’ t mean you suddenly lose the need to check facebook and certain elements of the , HA.. upper classes realised that we couldn ’ t go back to being medieval . Not really . Light bulbs and the internet and cars were all just way too good . Provincial attitudes may make you a king in a small world but small worlds mean small entertainments . <newline> <newline> So the “ system ” was invented . And it was enforced . The first week was a blood bath . But here , three years later , it works . The world turns again . The system works like this : Every person has a rating . For people of a certain “ rank ” they are empowered and obliged to protect a number of people below them in a community . The more powerful you are the more privileges are given to you and your community . Rank has some serious kick backs . Being rank one , which is what I am , means I am also the head of “ the hundred ” . The top one hundred ranked people in the country that , effectively , rules in an oligarchic model . Being in the hundred rocks . It ’ s awesome . You get respect , power , material wealth . The only drawback is that to obtain a seat in the hundred you must kill a person above you . <newline> <newline> Now I would like to say I have never killed anyone . People above me just , kind of , die . Even weirder no one has ever tried to kill me ! Next to my name on the federal data base , where everyone else has “ Head Exploder ” or “ Flying death machine with laser eyes ” is just a question mark . I mean , I suppose I could be lucky but I don ’ t really think that luck can be a power . <newline> <newline> The person who holds number two is actually a person from my work : Susan . She and I have been having coffee every morning ( barring a few during the bad years ) for , oh , seven years . Next to her name is a veritable encyclopaedia of powers . <newline> <newline> The other day she asked me out , which was a shock but since I have always secretly liked her it wasn ’ t an unpleasant one . We are going out on Tuesday , to see a movie . I ’ m looking forward to it . <newline>

Sixty years of this bullshit and people sometimes still take a swing . <newline> <newline> <newline> I 've been attacked by mind benders but they throw off so much heat , I can feel their hum from a mile off . Buzzing around like a fly intoxicated by the glow of an electric insect trap . They are a pinch , drop them while I 'm brushing my teeth and they are just locking their front doors . <newline> <newline> <newline> The shifters are trickier . More sport there , able to change around their shape at will and flit about quickly . They do n't send out much of a vibe but once you start paying attention to neighborhood dogs , squirrels and crows it narrows them right down . Animals do n't hold their breath when they see you . Pop goes the weasel fuckers . <newline> <newline> <newline> Earth movers , wind callers , fire breathers and ... `` snort '' aquamen are obvious as gonorrhea , dirt stays put , winds here are seasonal and eastern , nothing is more predictable than the tide except maybe how flame breathers dress ...

Energy controls everything , here I thought there was nothing or nobody out there who could intrigue me . <newline> <newline> <newline>

6,"`` The town was in chaos for several months after the initial nuclear blast . Everyone had been irradiated and gained superhuman abilities . There were three main categories of powers gained : mental , physical and other . Once the chaos started to settle , these factions had then organized themselves into three separate micro-governments that ranked themselves based on strength . Every four months , the top three from each power faction would meet up and discuss issues that effected everyone , such as an organization system for placing people into the proper factions . They decided that everyone would be numbered . The bigger the number , the weaker you were and vice versa . Then , once a year , every single person would be re-numbered to account for powers waxing or waning over time . Then , if at any point in the year someone was unhappy with their number , they had the right to challenge the number directly superior to them and fight to the death . <newline> <newline> I was immediately placed into Other after the Strongest Nine had cleared up organization system . The reason was that , other than my eyes going solid white , I showed no evidence of having powers . This is exactly how I had wanted it . I knew deep inside myself that my powers were too strong and unique to be allowed to surface . The few people who had ever found out soon had the memory removed from them at my will . That was my power : will . I could impose my will on any living being so strongly that they have to obey or they will be driven mad . I tried not to use it too often at first , nothing more than to enable myself to be lazy and to get some of my closest friends a better place in life , but after nearly a decade of being selfless , I decided it was my time to rise . The Strongest Nine had become corrupt , their structure was practically nonexistent . They lived only for themselves . I had to do something to work my way to number 3 or higher . I began challenging people , forcing them to commit suicide so that I could advance . The climb from number 472 was slow , but steady . I paced myself so that it would n't seem I was too greedy , and finally I had made it ! The first new member of the Strongest Nine since the blast ! Naturally , everyone was terrified and jealous . Many people tried to bribe number 4 into killing me and finding out my secrets , but obviously that would never work . With me in the Strongest Nine , they suddenly had a major change of heart and reworked the entire system back to relative normality . After many years making sure that the system had been truly fixed and corruption-proofed , I set everything in order and dissappeared . Everyone thought they knew where I was and many even found where I hid , but the truth is that they came , they saw , and they were told to forget . I lived a peaceful life all alone and eventually I died in my sleep . <newline> <newline> But then I woke up here . '' <newline> <newline> The man in the lab coat nodded and scribbled some more down on the clipboard he held . He muttered to himself , something about `` increase the dosage '' and left . I was alone with my pillows once more .
"
6,"`` It 's invisibility , right ? '' Seven asks , leaning forward . <newline> <newline> `` You really think One would survive this long with that ? Where do you think he 's been hiding that Three would n't find him ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Maybe his invisibility prevents it . '' Seven replied , a confused look on his face . <newline> <newline> `` What . . . Do you even know what Three does ? She feels the world through tremors . She can make literally any substance vibrate at whatever frequency she wants , and feel those vibrations resonate within herself . Concrete , rubber , air , she can scan anything . And tear it to pieces . '' True to his title , the information broker knew the powers of all the strongest players . Many of them had sold each other out over the years in exchange for some other bit of information . By now he had become too useful for any of the champions to take him down . <newline> <newline> `` Oh . Well , maybe he does n't vibrate . '' Seven looked almost proud of this point . It was ridiculous how lucky some fools got . Born with dissipation , the boy could turn to vapor in an instant . He must 've turned his brain to vapor a long time ago and forgot how to turn it back . <newline> <newline> `` That 's ridiculous . No , I 'll tell you the same thing I 've told everyone else who comes in here . I do n't know . I 'll never know . He 's *Number One , * do you think someone like me , ranked in the tens of thousands , could even guess what someone like that could do ? If I did find out , do you think he 'd let me live ? '' Seven walked away , like all the other fools . <newline> <newline> Nobody *tried* to be a low rank . All of the low levels either played it safe and lived as normally as they could , or they tried to kill someone at least in the low thousands . The lower class never killed each other , because there was nothing to gain . The higher class was a bloodbath , constantly struggling to reach the top , a peak nobody had attained for over twenty years . None of them realized the hell they were walking into when they tried to fight their way to the top . <newline> <newline> Me ? I 'm a nobody . # 60974 . Nobody even notices me , they all think I 'm so far beneath them . They come in , get their information , and leave . The previous One even came into my office once . He was so high-and-mighty that he looked at me almost as if I were a cockroach . Thank God he was just the fastest man in the world , and not someone actually tough to kill . Even someone faster than lightning can die , if you know exactly where he 's going to be , and when he 'll be there . The poor fool was still looking down his nose at me when the laser burst through his skull . Cheap little trick , but it worked . Burn a hole through my office floor , but no matter . <newline> <newline> Nobody ever suspects me . They all think I 'm # 60974 , a harmless information broker just trying to make a living . Why would I want to be # 1 ? I 'd rather leave the fighting to all the other fools . All I have to do is convince them I 'm weak but useful , and everyone leaves me alone . <newline> The best part ? They all think Number One is out there , and they 're waiting for me to find him .
"
6,"Oh yes . I definitely remember , every single detail . He was wearing a red and silver striped tie , for example . How could I ever forget that day ? I walked into his office as number 21,458 . When I left , I had his number 1 . <newline> <newline> Quite a frenzy it set off , you know ? At first , people did n't even know it was me . I remember the first reporter I ever talked to , after she 'd discovered that I was on his calendar for 2 PM , right about when he 'd died . First question she asked me ? `` Who else was in the room with you ? '' Thanks for the vote of confidence , lady . <newline> <newline> Well , eventually they managed to wrap their puny minds around it . I was the new # 1 in town , and I had the token to prove it . News organizations exploded : some nobody is now the most powerful person in town ? No one had even witnessed what my power was ! There was endless speculation and chatter about what I could do . I remember this one professor from the university , speculating that I could make someone explode just by thinking about them . All sorts of self-proclaimed experts came forward to discuss it . And do n't you know it , all of them were pounding on my door for that exclusive interview . <newline> <newline> Well , it became pretty clear that I was n't talking . So then the challenges started coming . Who was first ? I think it was that bloke who could control flames . Nice guy , bit of a hothead ... <newline> <newline> No ? Nothing . Fine . <newline> <newline> Well , I met up with him and accepted the challenge , but on the condition that we fight in an empty room , no cameras or witnesses . He agreed , and we found an empty gym on the outskirts of town . Well , of course you know what happened to him , and to that entire neighborhood . I made the same offer to any other challenger : I was taking callers , but only if we fought alone . Same offer still stands , you know , but it 's been years since anyone has taken me up on it . <newline> <newline> Once it became pretty clear that no one was going to take the number from me , or see me in a fight , then they tried other methods . You know how many women I met who tried to seduce the information out of me ? Hell , that 's why I 'm *still* a bachelor : I just ca n't trust any of them . Then came the offers : money , jobs , protection , you name it . Every prominent member of the city wanted me as their bodyguard , but on the condition that I told them what I could do . I told 'em to shove it . Then , they went after my friends and my parents , badgering them for information . So I became a recluse . Bought this cabin up here , just me and Buddy . My only friend ; dogs do n't care what my power is . And that 's been the story ever since . I 'm no longer involved in the tournament scene , and I guess the city is just going to have be content with only having a number 2 . <newline> <newline> Now , if you 'll excuse me , Buddy and I have some fish to catch , so I 'm afraid this interview is over . <newline> <newline> All right , one last question ... <newline> <newline> Yes , I knew this would be coming . Did you really think it would be that easy to get it out of me ? Nice try .
"
6,"`` I swear I am not bs-ing you . That is how my power really works . It is n't that complicated . Fine , I will explain again . <newline> <newline> There are infinite universes , and 3 trillion of them have people and allow existence of superpowers . At any given moment , there are , necessarily , 3 other universes with almost exactly the same circumstance with different outcomes about to take place . Why ? Well , here 's the formula *scribbles* , so this is true for all cases . Well , you do n't have to understand the formula . Just forget about that for now . Now , the reason I need to point out these other universes is ... ..No , my power has nothing to do with access to other dimensions , that is number 7 's power . I told you that already . Anyways , as soon as I identify these universes , I can link them with ogre satellite ray . Yes , I have the right to make that name up , since nobody else discovered it . Since I already established the link to these universes with different outcomes ... .No , I told you that already . My power is not probability manipulation . That is number 3 's power . I am not controlling probability , these things have already happened by the time I do it . Let me finish before you start drawing conclusions . After that I can link them together in this universe . The shape of the link is very important . Imagine knitting , but there is nothing intersecting ... .Never mind how I draw that . The knitting is in a shape of a bubble with me in it . Now , just like a sweater , you can flip it inside out . But it is important that no link touches me while it is being flipped . That is the only way I can gather the sufficient energy to actually activate my power . At this point in time , only about 0.02 seconds have passed since I decide to use my power . Here is the tricky part , now the initial burst of energy is transferred to my muscle and ... .No ! Not super-strength ! Have you ever seen me use any strength while fighting ? If all I need is strength , why would I need to jump through all those hoops to gather energy ? Well , of course you ca n't figure out how my power works from just looking at it ! Now , after that part , I can start vibrating the link , which affects other universes as well . Three other universes with three different branches will then become almost identical to ours now . Why almost ? Well , for what I am about to do , I need those universes to be synchronized to exactly 78.92 % . Any other ratio will not work . What purpose do my muscles serve at this point ? Nothing ... . *sigh* Here we go again . Listen , I am not bs-ing you . I am just telling you what I do in a chronological order . My muscles do n't come into play just yet . At this point , I am at 0.01 seconds after I decided to use my power . Yes , I said 0.02 seconds earlier on . No , I did n't misspeak . Well , I do n't really understand it myself , but I have run through the numbers many times . It is actually mathematically correct . It does happen after , but if you look at the result ... ..Do you want the short version or the long ? I have n't even gotten to the point where I start using the power yet . What do you mean I lost you ? How many times do I have to explain ? It is not that complicated ! ''

6,"BANG <newline> <newline> The gunshot rang out across the snowy scene clear as a bell . I stared at the shooter through half-lidded eyes . I watched as his face took a victorious look . He was so sure he had killed me . <newline> <newline> I looked down , picked the slug out of my jacket , then tossed it aside . I looked back at my assailant just in time to see his look of confusion . He did n't get it . they never did , not right away . I began my little mental game . <newline> <newline> It was n't a game I played with others , more of a personal gambling thing . *I bet he thinks its some man o ' steel BS . * I thought to myself . Surprisingly , his look of confusion gave way to one of utter determination . He dropped the gun , raised his fists , and charged . <newline> <newline> I blinked , but other wise I made no move . There was really no need . As he closed , his eyes took on a look that one gets when ones chess opponent has made a fatal flaw . He launched a hard right at my temple . <newline> <newline> His fist made contact , then burst into flames , rendered to ash . He screamed . I stood there , placing my wager on what was going through his mind as he writhed in the snow , rubbing his stump in the frost that coated the ground . *Maybe he just is n't thinking . * <newline> <newline> He finally stopped screaming , and his eyes whipped back to me . *Is he smiling ? Oh . * The flesh from his stump stretched , the exposed bone lengthening . He was a regenerator . How boring . <newline> <newline> He did n't even wait to finish regrowing his hand before he tried to strike again , stabbing up at my ribs with the sharp end of bone . These regenerators never thought before they acted , they jut relied on a wolverine-esque powers of regrowth to carry the day . My little mental game was over . No point wasting time . <newline> <newline> As his bone pierced my jacket , he let out a premature scream of victory before being catapulted backwards against the wall behind him , shattering his skull and sending bits of blood everywhere . He still was n't done though , as he fell to the ground , his body had already begun to rebuild itself . <newline> <newline> If he did n't get it before , his slowly rebuilding brain sure would n't get it now . I walked towards him , right arm extended , index finger outstretched to be placed on his forehead . His eyes widened as my power began to freeze him in place . <newline> <newline> My power is converting one kind of energy into any other kind of energy . Kenetic to potential , heat to kinetic , potential to heat , you fucking name it . The only restriction was that I had to be touching the thing whos energy I wanted to convert . I had converted to kinetic energy of the bullet into potential energy . I had turned the kinetic energy of his fist into heat energy . When he tried to stab me , I had converted his potential energy into backward kinetic energy . And now I was turning the heat energy of his body into potential energy , freezing him from within . Soon he was a human ice sculpture , half regrown and all kinds of grotesque . <newline> <newline> `` Fucking idiot . '' <newline> <newline> I flicked his frozen nose , converting every ounce of potential energy in his body into heat and kinetic , vaporizing him on the spot . I looked down at the holes he had put in my clothes with irritation . `` Now I have to get a new fuckin ' jacket . ''

6,"Three years . Three years since the status wars began . <newline> <newline> # 2 Is a scary fucker . He lives in the nuclear waste facility just outside the city borders . Sealed himself in a giant lead vault surrounded by coolant so he could live in his little personal sauna thats only slightly cooler than a supernova . I guess he figured he 's got a better shot hiding then going for the gold . I do n't blame him , he was my best friend after all . He killed the old # 2 by boiling the poor guy 's blood from across the street . <newline> <newline> # 3 is a sweet girl who happens to be the most powerful telepathic in the city . She mostly just detects any hostile feelings toward her in the city and forces the poor soul 's heart to stop , or turns off their brain . Whichever shes in the mood for . Three guesses on how she killed the old # 3 . Only thing stopping her from killing # 2 is she ca n't find him through all that lead . <newline> <newline> Numbers 4 and 5 are perfectly evenly matched cryokinetics . They 'd be perfectly happy with their positions if they were n't so close to each other . Good luck killing absolute zero with absolute zero , fellas ! Is it a cruel joke by fate , or just comic relief to entertain a bored god ? <newline> <newline> # 6 is a boring old telekinetic master . He could pull down the moon with a wag of his finger if he wants . Odd that he ca n't seem to move living tissue . Wonder why . <newline> <newline> # 7 Eats . Everything . Rocks , people , metal , fire , plasma , electricity , you name it , he eats it . If it can fit in his mouth ( or even if it ca n't ) he can just slurp it on down . Good ol ' # 6 is terribly afraid that his days are numbered . How do you beat something that just eats whatever you throw at it ? <newline> <newline> The rest are increasingly boring and increasingly weaker . Theres only about seventeen thousand left in the world . The peacekeepers died out , society became a hierarchy and all of it with me at the top . <newline> <newline> A few of em have tried to kill me but it never seems to work . Its not like they have n't found ways to kill immortals or respawners before . Heck , people have found ways through impenetrable shields , crawled out of black holes , survived being erased from existence and even pulled themselves back from complete atomization . <newline> <newline> But no ones killed me yet . Wan na hear a clue ? I 'm the only one who 's killed anyone in 3 years . Figure it out yet ? No ? Guess <newline> I 'll spell it out for ya then ! <newline> <newline> I 'm the only one with powers . But I got em all . I could have ruled the universe in an instant if I pleased , but that would get boring fast . A much funner way was to make everyone else think they have powers . I am the definition of Omnipotent . I woke up one day aware of every tiny detail in the universe , and even the multiverse . Best part was , I could control every detail too ! So I purposefully ignore the future and just decided to give everyone powers . Or make them think they do . <newline> I just read their minds and know what they would do with the power I made them think they have and then cause that to happen ! I mostly let them fight amongst themselves freely . What fun is a tournament if every match is rigged ? Someday they 'll all be gone . I ca n't wait to see the look on the last standing human when I tell him~ <newline> <newline>

6,"No one ever realized I did n't have a power . <newline> <newline> Number two is a telepath . I met him in a bar once , but I could feel his touch on my mind all the way down the street . It was light , I would never have felt it if he 'd only been looking , but when you 're used to being a pawn you learn to see when you 're being played with . He wanted me in that bar , and I complied . If he was going to kill me , I could n't have stopped him at that point anyway . I asked him in there , `` Why do n't you kill me ? No one would stop you . '' He laughed , and downed the remainder of his cup . `` No one wants to be first , kiddo . No one with half a shot at getting there , anyway . '' His knowing smile told me everything it needed to . I was a tool . A figurehead . I asked him what he wanted from me and he gave me a list of people who needed to be out of the city by next Sunday . He walked out , and I did as I was told . <newline> <newline> When they think you 're more powerful than the strongest soldiers the city state has to offer , they do n't question your authority . You say something happens and it does . <newline> <newline> Number six is an empath , though I do n't think she got her number on strength of power . It 's the connections that did it . She told me once she was glad that number one was a good man , or the city 'd be even worse off than it already is . I 'm sure I could be a bad one if I had the inclination , it 's only the top hundred or so I really have to keep happy . I 've just never wanted to . I asked her if that was why she 'd fallen in love with me and she gave me the coldest , most dangerous laugh I 've ever heard . <newline> `` You 're funny , '' she said . <newline> We both know damn well it 's me who loves her , and we both know equally well that I have no chance . Which does n't stop her from using me for all I 'm worth . <newline> <newline> I 'm not like the rest of the ten . I did n't kill to be here . Fate crowned me king at birth , and I 've yet to figure out what in God 's name it was thinking . <newline> <newline> Number four is a power thief . He 's the one who illuminated the mystery of my continued kinghood for me , down beneath the earth in a room full of tiny glass bottles and too much red to be comforting . He downed one of the bottles and settled against a shelf as his body changed . Creepy , that one . <newline> `` I 'm not going to cut you open and take your blood , '' he said with about as much care as he 'd give the weather . `` Do you know why ? '' <newline> `` Enlighten me . '' <newline> `` Because then I 'd have to run the city . I 'd have to appease Lamier and Asmar and the whole nest full of snakes . It would be a chronic waste of time , and I 'd hardly be able to balance it with my own projects . No no , you can keep your seat and your secrets . We serpents would n't touch your job with a ten foot pole . '' <newline> <newline> I am a pawn masquerading as king , a powerless man ruling the powerful , a good man with no convictions . But I am , if nothing else , an actor . If no one sees the contradictions ... Well , who am I to tell that they are there ?

6,"I was killing him . <newline> <newline> The next time I see that guy I was killing him . Plain and simple . Now , normally I would n't care if he did some great prank or killed some people . <newline> <newline> It did n't matter in this world anymore . We had been together for years and we could only survive using every means necessary so it did n't matter that we had no innocence . <newline> <newline> What I really cared about was the fact that he involved me in God-knows-what-he-is-planning ! <newline> <newline> Reading the ranking of everyone 's power , I scowled even more . Forget killing , I was going to torture him until he begged to die . <newline> <newline> He just made me Rank # 1 ! Who in the world would even want to be the number , knowing that everyone would target you to be the best ? <newline> <newline> Staring at how people eyed my movement , I quickly escaped to go looking for the cause of my troubles . I found him in our house . <newline> <newline> `` Black , I 'm killing you , '' was the only warning he got before I proceeded to try to maim him . <newline> <newline> The boy , who looked like me except for the gender , laughed out loud and dodged my attacks . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , come one , Red , live a little ! '' he muttered cheerfully . `` I 'll change the ranking after some days . I 'll even transport you to all the places you love ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Tempting but I still want to punch you , '' I clenched my knuckles and smiled before going for the hit . `` Really , do n't make it more obvious that you are the real # 1 ! People had already noticed how you seemed to have more than one power . '' <newline> <newline> He , my dear twin , just grinned , `` But you 'll always fix that , wo n't you ? '' <newline> <newline> I snorted . Whatever anger or annoyance I was feeling before was gone now . <newline> <newline> It was a secret between the two of us . We were unusual twins and we both lost our parents in a fire . <newline> <newline> Even though Black was the older twin by the minute , I was the one to take care of the two of us and act responsible . <newline> <newline> Black , on the other hand , would take care of the other people , who killed to get higher rank . <newline> <newline> As impossible as it sounded , I did n't have powers like everyone else but in exchange , my twin received all the powers in the world . They were careful not to let anyone know as it was already rare enough that a person had two or three powers . <newline> <newline> Someone with all the known powers ? That 's even worse and so they kept it a secret to themselves . <newline> <newline> I was afraid of what other people would do after finding out . I might not have powers myself but I would rather die than let my twin get hurt . <newline> <newline> .oxo . <newline> <newline> Black watched his younger twin sleep before he sighed , snapping his fingers . He stared widely at the copy of the ranking before . <newline> <newline> He lied to Red about the ranking . It was the true ranking . Red was the Rank # 1 and he did n't know what to do with it . <newline> <newline> He tried very hard to hide it but the fact that the ranking still deemed Red as number one , it was a matter of fact before her power was forced to surface . <newline> <newline> There 's no such thing as a person with no powers . No matter how he wished it it was the truth . Suppressed , yes but not gone . <newline> <newline> And Red was like that and her power was more powerful than his . <newline> <newline> After all , what 's the best thing from having all the powers other than being able to steal or copy other people 's powers by instinct ?

6,"I do n't want it anymore . It 's really boring . <newline> <newline> Some people say it 's lonely at the top , those people are really stupid . It 's crowded at the top . I 'd like to say that it 's because I show mercy , or take pity . In reality , holding the top spot is really easy for me , being second to me has to be a nightmare . <newline> <newline> There 's this amazing unwritten code between people at the top . Once you become second , you get a week . You get one week to come find me . Everybody , from the new number three all the way out of the top ten , they just leave you alone for a week . I never complain , everyone seems to take the whole duration of their week to prepare and I can enjoy the downtime . Not that I really have a whole lot to do anymore . <newline> <newline> But it 's a feeding frenzy when the second fails . They come to me , they challenge me with pride , there 's a majesty to being the best . Even if you were scum of the Earth , you would still have pride when you challenged me . You will fail in the end , and will be slaughtered mercilessly , but you have pride , I remember what it 's like to have pride , I think . <newline> <newline> The place where we are fighting is quaint . We are alone , I always insist on my fights being private . I can feel your hand closing around my throat , you 're not gloating . You just want to know how someone who is so weak could possibly still be at the top . How have I not killed you yet ? You know that all the news stories , all the deaths of second ranked schmucks , are n't actually me . They 're credited to me , but they are n't me . You 've taken part in a few group assassinations of failing number twos . That 's how you got here . I understand though , because if you can just crush my windpipe like this , why am I still at the top ? <newline> <newline> I struggle a little , it 's futile . Your super strength guarantees I 'm not going to escape . I 'm just frustrated with the whole thing and I really want it to end . You still wo n't do it , will you ? You have to know why am I at the top , and why I 've been here through so many great supers . Contract killers , super-powered good samaritans , even kids with extraordinary abilities ... they 've all come to challenge me for the privileges of being king of the hill and you 're so close . You 're angry I wo n't fight back . <newline> <newline> The beeping starts in your pocket , probably your cell phone telling you that your week is up and the lynch mob is coming . You have no choice now , you 'd better hurry . I just smile as you grimace and squeeze with all your might , I feel the rush of pain as you snap my neck effortlessly . You drop me to the ground and raise your arms in triumph , I 'll read about you in the paper tomorrow . I think number three uses acid , that one will be grisly . <newline> <newline> 12:01 AM and my corpse vanishes . I reappear fit as a fiddle in my apartment and check the ranking terminal . I wonder if you begged for your life confused , while you insisted that you killed the most powerful man in the city . I 'm sorry you had to fail , I 'm very sorry you had to die . It 's your fault , it 's been the fault of every number two for over a century now . <newline> <newline> You all insist on fighting . You all insist on coming to kill the unkillable man . You are want the privilege of being number one . <newline> <newline> One of you can have it , I do n't want it anymore . I just want to die .

6,"Hello , my name is Tommy . I know what you 're probably thinking but no , I do n't have a cool name like Atom Smasher or Dr. Destro or anything like that . Just Tommy . What a lot of people do n't understand is that there are thousands of us ... . millions , maybe . We all have powers and most of us use them just to get by in the world . It 's not all flying around , punching criminals into the next zip code though . Most of us are n't that powerful . My best friend , Alex , glows in the dark . That 's it . His super power is to never need a flashlight . Anyways , we all have these little buttons that show our respective power levels . I 'm not sure where they came from or why everyone wears them , it 's just how it 's always been done . The numbers change based on the situation to show how powerful a particular person is in that situation . For example , on of the guys that lives down the hall from me is a werewolf . So for most of the month he 's powered somewhere around 16,000 , but on the night of the full moon he jumps up to 117 . That might seem like a big jump but remember my friend Alex ? His number is 1,367 . For every Captain Coast there are thousands of people like Alex . The numbers seem to change based of situational forces , cold-based powers get lower numbers in the winter and someone who channels sunlight has a higher number on a cloudy day . Anyways , I had managed to hide what I could do for most of my adult life . I 'm a healer . I 'm not entirely sure how it happens , but with concentration I can heal most injuries and illnesses . I ca n't bring people back from the dead , I 've tried and it did n't work ( R.I.P . Sarah ) . I 'm not able to do it a lot because it takes a lot out of me , but a few times a day I can help someone who needs it . I 've had a job in the hospital for a few years . Even wearing a number ( usually around 1,066 ) nobody seems surprised that I never showed any sorts of powers , some people have powers that just do n't do much . The first thing I noticed on that day was the strange looks people started giving me . People I 'd know for years were just looking sideways at me , people I 'd never met before had expressions ranging from disbelief to fear . I could n't figure it out until I went into the restroom and looked into the mirror . My number had changed and was now glowing with 512 . How did that happen ? How could somebody suddenly become twice as powerful as yesterday ? A glitch ? A mass cape-killing ? No , that could n't be it . I work in the hospital , I 'd have heard if there was some kind of mass superhero killing . I tried to ignore it and go about my day . Tried to keep my button hidden . Every time I quietly checked the number kept changing . 501 . 458 . 311 . 154 ? Now I remember seeing the Masked Avenger at 135 and she saved the world a few years ago . I was starting to get scared and was about to say to my boss that I was leaving for the day , then the rumbling started . The hallways suddenly shifted sideways and threw everybody off their feet . I landed in a darkened area ... must have fallen into the basement . The only light came from my glowing button , I looked down and my heart dropped as I saw a big , golden number 1 .

You 've lived your whole damn life under my sky ... I 'm God to you , and I doubt your arms are long enough to box with me . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh get off it , everyone 's got ta die someday old man ! '' <newline> <newline> He charged at me , full of piss and vinegar , he had n't gotten where he was for no reason . Back in the day anyone who was within the first ten had the right to challenge # 1 for his spot . It was anarchy , bloody riots in the street and public executions writ mass . I ended that and created order . In one night I killed all other members of the ten and ended the games once and for all ... Why did people always seem so insistent on never letting old systems die ? <newline> <newline> His hands were crackling with lightning , he fully intended on cooking me from the inside out . If he touched me there was a very real chance I was going to die . He was sloppy but made it up in brute force . <newline> <newline> `` So I 'll take that as a no . '' <newline> <newline> `` YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT ! '' <newline> <newline> I caught his hand with mine . an older hand grabbing onto the strong arm of youth . I 'd trapped him now . He seemed perplexed , they always do when their powers stop working . <newline> <newline> `` th ... the hell did you do ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I make illusions . We 're in one right now . I 've trapped you here , you never had a chance . But I 'm not like other illusionists . Truth be told , I ca n't keep this up for very long , it 's something of a weakness really . but ... I make the illusion reality . '' <newline> <newline> the knife plunged inside of him , he gasped , looking up at me as if I had betrayed him . As if we were even playing by the same rules . I let the illusion die away , substituting it for reality , cutting it and editing it like so much film . There was now a flyaway illusion where he was killing me , but here in the real world he was dead , a cooling corpse . Maybe I needed to take a more active place in the world , they 'd forgotten what it meant to be afraid ... How bothersome .

6,"`` So , are you number 1 ? '' Some silly junior from the newspaper club had stopped me in the courtyard . She is an attractive petite girl wearing a short skirt and thigh high socks . Her short brown hair that fell in curls just below her ears had a habit of bouncing while she turned her head . `` That 's what they want me and everyone else to believe . Look you stick around me for five minutes and you 'll meet someone else deluded enough to believe the fantasy as well . '' I must have been a little more harsh with my words than I intended by the way she looked at me in fear . <newline> <newline> Crossing the courtyard was my thing during lunch , enjoying the shade of some oak trees as I walked to the back of the gymnasium to get to the grass field . The girl kept up with my pace asking more unimportant questions about powers , `` Nonsense '' , another one about 4 and 6 's feud that would last for hours after school , `` They should just start dating '' . My answers were always short and indifferent . <newline> <newline> Just as I start digging into my lunch bag , pudding check , someone rounds the corner of the gymnasium to intrude on my fortress of shade . I do n't actually notice the person at first just the newspaper girl who begins bouncing excitedly . I can watch her do that all day . Her gleeful screams over the fact that number 3 had showed makes me think one pudding cup is inadequate for today 's lunch . <newline> <newline> I could easily see how 3 was the heartthrob for the female student . Tall with a slight muscular build , Symmetrical face with not overly sharp features , Dark black hair styled in the current popular fashion , and deep blue eyes that looked like they could fill any ocean they look at . How in the world did he get wrapped up in this nonsense ? He had stopped about ten steps away . <newline> <newline> `` Senior Lord Devian Rorrschtazz the First of Grand Gaia , I have come to end your tyranny ! I bring the hopes and dreams of all the sophomoric gentlemen , the aspirations of the Junior Rebellion , and the love of every beating female heart in all the land to put and end to your malicious motivation to kill all that is good and new in the word . I , Sokolomon of third , will see to it personally that you no longer taint these sacred grounds . '' <newline> <newline> My hate for his monologue is only match by my desire for a third pudding cup . The Newspaper girl had actually managed to look wilted after his speech . I guess her feelings could n't survive hearing him talk for that long and all I could on from her was a scathing front page article of how I have ruined another valiant knight . <newline> <newline> `` Prepare yourself for my Super Lightning Jab Combo that will bring freedom to all the land ! '' He raised his right arm to near his jaw and began to scream . I 'm sure in his mind 's eye he was channeling electricity or something . I shake my head as he begins his charge , arm outstretched and aimed for my head . His last step before reaching me I drop my hips low , grab his arm , and pull him over my shoulder as I rotate in a half circle . The effort sends him tumbling over and past me landing on the ground with a loud thud before rolling another few feet . <newline> <newline> The Newspaper girl shrieks while running over to her fallen hero . She kneels down next to him and pulls his head close to her as if cradling it would undo any damage . I bend down and pick up my lunch before walking to the newest participant of this farce and pull of the number three sticker off of his shoulder . Guess I 'll give this to number two , he always liked setting this up . The Newspaper girls sobs fill me with a desire for a forth pudding cup as I walk of back to a normal school life .

6,"`` Hey ! That 's the guy that killed my cousin ! Pull over ! '' <newline> <newline> *Here it comes again , * I thought to myself . I turned to face my attacker . The third in as many days . Some punk with a third-rate powerset . Probably born since the District was walled off . <newline> <newline> I sized him up . No obvious indicators of his power . Nothing obvious on his clothes to indicate anything either . <newline> <newline> `` You 're nothin ' ! you hear me ! ? Nothin ' ! '' <newline> <newline> I ignored him and walked closer for a better look . He pulled a gun out of his vest and shot me in the head . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> `` Hey ! That 's the guy that killed my cousin ! Pull over ! '' <newline> <newline> *Gun in the vest , go for that first . Either wants to show off his gun , or his power is n't a combat power . * <newline> <newline> `` You 're noth- huh ? '' I cut him off as I pulled the gun out of the vest . Biometrically locked . Useless to me . I tossed it aside . I examined his response . Too stupid to be surprised that I knew he had a gun . Not surprising , I suppose . He wound up for a haymaker . I watched for any giveaways . Nothing off about his stance , no glowing motes or strange noises . I braced my self for impact , making no effort to dodge . Predictably , it knocked my head clean off . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> *Gun in vest , something that acts like super strength , maybe kinetic manipulation ? * <newline> <newline> `` Hey ! That 's th- '' I cut him off with a thrown chunk of debris . No reaction whatsoever . <newline> <newline> `` You 're dead , you piece of shit ! I 'll fuckin pick my teeth with your bones ! '' Curious . Altered dietary requirements , or just a threat ? I could n't smell anything odd on his breath , and all his teeth looked standard issue . Probably just a threat . <newline> <newline> I go for his gun , just like last time , and throw it away . He winds up for a haymaker , which ends up being too slow to hit me . I take an experimental punch . The relatively light jab does nothing to him , but breaks my arm . *call it kinetic manipulation then . * <newline> <newline> His next attack crushes my ribcage . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> I reset to before his car comes around the corner and look around my environment . There 's no such thing as invincible . Honestly , simple immunity to physical harm is one of the least annoying powers to deal with . Someone seemingly invulnerable might be vulnerable to poison , or radiation , or maybe just still needs to breathe . That 'll do , right there . If his only power is contact-range crude kinetic manipulation , this can of ... aerosol brake cleaner should do the trick . I look on the warning label . It 's an older product , which usually means more poisonous . An entire half of the can dedicated to warnings not to ingest or expose to eyes . Good . <newline> <newline> `` Hey ! That 's the guy that killed my cousin ! Pull over ! '' <newline> <newline> He steps out of the car . <newline> <newline> `` You 're nothin ' ! you hear me ! ? Nothin ' ! '' <newline> <newline> I duck toward him and retrieve his gun . He grabs for me , an attack I easily dodge . I raise the can to his face and press the trigger . He screams as the chemicals contact his soft tissues . I do n't think it 'll kill him but ... I take an experimental kick at his side as he writhes on the ground . No reaction . Means he needs to be able to concentrate . I drag him over to the edge of the sidewalk while his driver looks on in horror . I take his head and slam his open mouth down on the curb twice . He stops moving . <newline> <newline> It 's all over too quickly for a real crowd to gather , but the driver and the little old lady crossing the street stare , wide-eyed . I do n't think anyone has ever guessed what my power lets me do . Fine by me . They 're welcome to keep coming . They 'll run out of challengers long before I get tired of destroying them .

6,"It 's always the high-numbered ones that think they have a shot . Some up and coming punk that thinks that this is their once in a lifetime chance to take down # 1 ... as if they can just skip all of the other ranks and become a superstar . They never really consider how I GOT to be number one . I 've fought fire powers , ice powers , lightning powers , one guy that had some special affinity toward guns , another that could teleport . There were a couple of psychics that were trippy for awhile , but everyone 's power all comes from the same place . <newline> <newline> This latest one was barely a teenager . It 's a shame how this will have to end . I do n't like killing , but I 've started to accept that it 's a necessary part of how the world is . That scares me a little , but it 's better than being dead . The kid in front of me looks like he joined a street gang before he got his powers . He 's got a fireball hovering above each hand but he has n't made a move yet . I guess that my number is scaring him , making him size me up before he makes a move . Smart . <newline> <newline> `` So what 's your deal ? I do n't see nothin ' ! You 're the invincible number one ! Show me what you got ! '' <newline> <newline> The kid does n't even know my name ... probably does n't care . I take a quarter out of my pocket and hold out my hand . The coin rises a few inches off of my palm and the punk gets ready to dodge , or block , or he 's not sure which . <newline> <newline> `` My power 's not much , just basic telekinesis . I can barely lift my own body weight without getting tired . The real strength is all in what I know . '' <newline> <newline> `` You going to throw that at me ? Some kinda psychic railgun ? ! '' I can hear and edge in the kid 's voice . He looks like he 's ready to make his move . Subtle changes in his stance give it away . I laugh as the coin drops back into my palm and I pocket it . <newline> <newline> As he starts to charge at me , I swing my hand at the air in front of me . At the same moment , a wave of air slaps his cheek from the side , then again as it wave my hand the other way and hit his other cheek . I 'm amused as his fireballs dissipate , I guess that he needed to concentrate to maintain them . He does n't know it yet but that was a warning shot . <newline> <newline> `` You really should go home kid . Last chance , I 'm letting you go . '' <newline> <newline> I 'm honestly hoping that he takes this chance , but I see the flames starting to encircle his forearms now . Are his hands the only things he can use this fire with ? He might even be interesting if he backs off and explores his powers a little more . <newline> <newline> The kid glares at me . `` Or what ? ! You 'll go Darth Vader on me ? I 'll roast you alive before you ca- '' <newline> <newline> A look of surprise comes over the kid 's face now . While he was talking , I had raised a hand and had cut him off mid-word . He 'd suddenly forgotten not only what he was going to say , but how to say it . The surprise turned to terror as his body suddenly stopped responding . I was n't strong enough to hold him up , so it was obvious when his legs stopped working and he collapsed to the ground . <newline> <newline> I looked down at his terrified face , we both knew what was coming next . Just like he could n't heal burns , I could n't undo what I 'd done , at least not without being able to see it and that required an operating room . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll make it quick , kid . Like I said , the real power is in what I know . '' I said softly , as I reached out into the maze of neurons and blood vessels underneath his skull , and blindly tugged at a few delicate strands . <newline> <newline> EDIT : Thanks , OP , for the special mention . I 'm glad that people like the story . : )

6,"It was about 10 years ago . I was 23 then . Half the city got powers of some sort or another , although only the top 1000 had numbers . The number was on one of your hands . It was figured out pretty quickly that killing someone of higher rank made you advance , though other things seemed to affect it too . I don ’ t know just how many died from everyone trying to get themselves a higher rank , especially those who entered the ranks as the years went by . <newline> Being ranked Number 1 , I suppose it was good that I was raised to respect everyone and act properly , seeing how easy it would be to abuse my power . It took a year or so to train myself to not accidentally use it on someone . It still gets used subconsciously , unless I really concentrate , but otherwise it ’ s bearable . <newline> I came out of my apartment when I noticed the chaos . There were enough superpowers dedicated to keeping the peace so thankfully there wasn ’ t really any looting , but it still wasn ’ t good . I found the local corner store owner just outside her store and asked what was going on . “ Number 2 just gave a challenge to Number 1 . He can ’ t find him so he ’ s pulled some asteroid and it ’ s gon na hit earth tomorrow , wipe humanity out if Number 1 can ’ t stop it. ” That surprised me . Number 2 was a proficient telekinetic and telepath who seemed content with his power and his position . He was on the news enough , that ’ s for sure . Still , I guess he didn ’ t like how whoever gave the ranks still didn ’ t think he belonged on top . <newline> I went to a rooftop and waited . It would be easier to deal with this asteroid if I could see it . Makes it easier to focus I guess . It was night when I spotted it , sort of like a small misshapen moon . I focus ; can start to feel the headache from pushing myself like this . Once I take care of this I need to find Number 2 . <newline> I ’ m in a hospital . I feel weak , must be from exerting myself so much . The nurse has just entered the room . She notices I ’ m awake , starts checking on me , explains that I had a brain hemorrhage and says she going to go get the doctor . Also mentions it ’ s practically a miracle I ’ m alive . “ Wait . What day is it ? ” It ’ s been a month . I ’ ve been here a month . She leaves . I start feeling better quickly , except for that small headache again . I ’ m about ready to get out of the bed when the nurse returns . “ The doctor is with another patient , but will come here once he ’ s done Mr. Cooper. ” <newline> I ’ m surprised , “ You remember my name ? ” <newline> “ It ’ s part of the job . Should I not remember your name ? ” <newline> “ No , it ’ s just that I seem to be . . . a very forgettable person. ” <newline> She stops for a second , seems to hesitate , argue with herself , then asks “ Do you remember what was going on right before you lost consciousness ? ” <newline> “ Like what ? ” <newline> “ No one else remembers that an asteroid was about to hit earth . They tell me I just had a really bad dream or something . But I saw it , the asteroid just disappeared , and it seems everyone ’ s memories about it were erased . They forgot. ” <newline> I stop . Affecting everyone on Earth like that would explain the mental damage requiring medical care . But why was n't she affected . I suddenly notice the small number on her hand . It ’ s 2 . I smile ; it doesn ’ t seem she ’ s noticed it yet . “ I think that number on your hand represents your answer. ” I get up , showing her the number on mine . “ If you ’ ll excuse me ; I have some personal business that I need to attend to. ” Yes , due to his actions , endangering earth like that , feeding his ego , the former Number 2 needs to be entirely erased as well . <newline>

6,"You want an interview ? Fine , but you 're buying the coffee . I 'm getting kind of sick of this god-damned urban legend . I DO N'T have superpowers , no-one has superpowers . There are just a bunch of crazy people who think they have powers , who for some reason have decided that I 'm some fucked up version of their messiah . <newline> <newline> **You do n't believe super-powered people exist ? ** <newline> <newline> No . I 've never seen one . I 've seen the doctored footage from the media . I 've seen a lot of crazy people who thought they had powers . I do n't know why they gravitate to me of all people . I 'm just a regular guy . I put in my hours in the office , then at the gym . <newline> <newline> **So you have n't heard about the ranking system ? ** <newline> <newline> Oh , I 've heard of their ranking system all right . That 's all I ever hear . What baffles me is why they chose me to be their number one , their highest rank . That the only way for people to rise in rank and become more powerful is to kill them . Does that sound sane to you ? <newline> <newline> Then one day , some poor bastard commits suicide near me , and suddenly , they decide that I 'm the number one on their hitlist . <newline> <newline> **You are referring to the death of the Human Jet as suicide ? ** <newline> <newline> Man faceplants on the ground from a hundred feet , that 's suicide . It does n't matter that he said `` Up Up and Away '' before he jumped off that building . That was suicide . <newline> <newline> **The Human Jet was one of our greatest heroes , with documented evidence of his powers..** <newline> <newline> Blah Blah Blah . I 've heard that all before . I was there , I saw him hit the ground . Where the hell do you people in the media get off encouraging these people . They are a danger to themselves . Surely you must have learned your lesson after Inferno Man . <newline> <newline> **Inferno Man was a criminal , whose control over fire rendered him a threat to the world ... ** <newline> <newline> Bullshit . Let me tell you what happened when I met this so called inferno man . I was just hanging out in a cafe not far from here , when this asshole shows up in a stupid costume . He bursts in , and gives this long speech about how he 's going to kill me and burn everything down . <newline> <newline> Then nothing happened . He stood there for like five minutes , straining , and glaring at me . I do n't know what I did , I just wanted my cup 'o ' joe . Then he leaves , and I thought `` That was weird , I 'm glad it 's over '' . <newline> <newline> Then he comes back , with a barrel of gasoline . Who the fuck would sell him gasoline . that 's beside the point . The point is that the fucker doused himself in the stuff , and then pulled out a lighter and set himself on fire . Right in front of me . Hearing him scream almost put me off my coffee . <newline> <newline> **Yes , quite a lot of superpowered villains have died under similar mysterious circumstances in your presence** <newline> <newline> If by superpowered people , you mean insane people , then yes . The numbers of clowns in capes who drop out of the sky near me is so bloody annoying . Not to mention the scrawny fucks who just straight up try to pick fights with me . <newline> Oh god , there was one which was genuinely funny . <newline> <newline> This guy came up to me with this long speech about how he is one with nature , and that he will use all of his power to destroy me . I do n't know why these guys always got ta speech at me . When I punch someone , I punch'em , I do n't tell 'em my life story . <newline> He had this tiger with him . Big fucking cat . He told the tiger to get me . Moment the muzzle was off , it savaged him . I fucking split my sides . <newline> <newline> **So you do n't think you have any superpowers at all ? ** <newline> <newline> Course not . Like I said *nobody* has superpowers . At least not that I 've seen , not when they 're around me .

6,"`` Its him again . '' Tomas said and pointed down the street . <newline> <newline> I looked where Tomas pointed and sighed in annoyance . It was him again this time he had some sort of mech suit on . Same guy every week , right about the same time of day on friday , poor bastard had resurrection powers , could n't die no matter how badly he was killed . I heard that the nut job # 18 had used his pyro power to turn the man to carbon ash and yet he returned the same time on friday a week later . <newline> <newline> `` He has n't learned , dumb luck got him that fifteen . '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah Kim had no idea she was allergic to lilac until that moron knocked a bottle of it on her . '' Tomas said . `` I still remember that look on her face as she swelled up so fast that she asphyxiated in a couple seconds . I wish I could forget it like forty does every time he sheds his skin . '' <newline> <newline> I stood up and waited . Predictably he charged at me firing what looked like micro rockets . They burst around me never touching me as usual . Why no one has figured out nothing can harm me I have no idea , I figured it out because I fell off a roof and should 've died , then there was that truck that should 've pasted me but did n't , the crane load that should 've made me a smear , you get the idea . I think Tomas knows but he 's also a telepath nothing is secret to him but he keeps a lot secret , he also likes his near the bottom of the list number it lets him go around basically unknown . Myself on the other hand some how made it to number one when most of the high ranks killed for their number , with the exception of this repeat offender . He reached me and tripped , yes tripped , fell on something pointy that went right through a joint in his suit and that was it he was dead again . I sat down as the powers cleanup crew rolled around behind the cops and ambulance , the PCC makes the big bucks from this stuff and routinely send me gifts of a few varieties , I have n't had to buy a new car since I made number one as one of the best perks of them thanking me for the steady business , I also go through a lot of cars as you can imagine . I am grateful for the laws that say no challenge can occur at a residence or in a residential area , otherwise I would have a problem with housing weekly . <newline> <newline> `` You okay Titan ? '' Tomas asked . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah as usual he did n't even touch me . '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` Maybe your power is luck ? '' Tomas asked as I signed the usual forms , he had that grin I come to know meant he was playing with the knowledge he had . <newline> <newline> `` Or he has the rare double power and the other one is bad luck . '' I said playing along . <newline> <newline> `` Ouch resurrection and bad luck that is a hell of a way to live . '' Tomas said . <newline> <newline> `` Hey you talk to Isabella why has n't she come along and picked him up to take to the Sanctuary ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` You know Immortals when it 's time and all that . '' Tomas said . `` She does like it when I tell her about your weekly encounter with Bob . She had a giggling fit when I told her about that fish suit thing he wore third week last month . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah that was his I 'll try anything period . '' I said making a mocking jest to try and liven my mood . <newline> <newline> Tomas smiled . <newline> <newline> `` Why do we call him Bob again ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` Lily called him that after he barely survived her telekenetic spear . '' Tomas said . `` It stuck I guess . Hey you have the form copy what 's his real name ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked at the sheet of yellow paper , my copy of the report form . <newline> <newline> `` You 'll love this . '' I said and let Tomas pick it from my mind . <newline> <newline> Tomas roared a laugh . <newline> <newline> `` Robert , nice . '' He said .

6,"'Do you ever stop to think what he 's capable of , # 10 ' <newline> <newline> <newline> I stared at him blankly . It 's a thought that had never crossed my mind . # 2 looked at me expectantly , waiting for me to say something . All the while a levitating a small rock in his hand , transmuting it from stone to precious metal and back . <newline> <newline> <newline> 'Of course you have n't , no one does . Are you worried that he can read your mind ? That 's the most common response I get . I can tell you now that that is n't it , otherwise I would probably be dead now . Have you ever wondered why this law of challenges exists ? ' <newline> <newline> <newline> I shook my head . Again it 's not anything I thought about . 'It 's just how life has always been , right # 2 ? ' <newline> <newline> 'Not always , no . It was created many years ago to keep us from ripping each others necks out . Everyone here is strong but ... everyone also has weaknesses . Without these laws we would have anarchy . Each person would use their powers to kill anyone else weaker than them and usurp rule . # 1 realized this and , in an effort to keep order , implemented the Challenge . ' <newline> <newline> 'Power begets rank , rank begets strength , strength forsakes weakness , ' I reply in the tone of a schoolboy responding to a teacher . <newline> <newline> 'Exactly , # 10 , exactly . The fine print says you must challenge someone who is the next rank above yours . If you defeat them , you gain their rank . Any murder not enacted under a challenge is a death sentence . # 1 has ensured that anyone breaking this rule sees punishment . ' <newline> <newline> 'So why have n't you challenged # 1 , # 2 ? ' <newline> <newline> He looked at me as if this offended him . <newline> <newline> 'Why have n't I challenged him ? Why have n't you challenged 9 ? Why does n't 11 challenge yo ? ! Because it takes planning , finesse , an exposed weakness , complete confidence in your strengths ! You did n't fly that I-Beam into the old 10 's skull without knowing absolutely that it would kill him , did you ? No one has ever known what # 1 is capable of . He set up the whole fucking system in the first place ! Do you think I have n't done my research . The only thing I know for sure is that he never leaves his home . That fucking little ranch house on the edge of town . ' <newline> <newline> 'Why do n't you go see him ? You do n't have to challenge him , maybe you could befriend him until he lets something slip ? ' <newline> <newline> 'Unlikely , he 'd probably kill me the moment I stepped outside the city . ' <newline> <newline> 'Maybe not . Maybe he wants to meet you too . You are the most powerful thing here , next to him of course . ' <newline> <newline> 'You really think so ? ' <newline> <newline> 'Of course , why else would you be # 2 . Besides , did n't someone wise once say to keep your friends close but your enemies closer . This might be the perfect way to find out what breaks him . ' <newline> <newline> 2 sat for a second , dumbfounded . 'Damnit , 10 . That 's the best idea I 've ever heard come out of your mouth . I 'll do it , ' he said with renewed vigor . 'I 'll go meet him , see what he 's all about . ' Patting me on the back he went to the window , looking out onto the grand expanse of our city . <newline> <newline> 'Things do have a peculiar way of happening around here , do n't they 10 ? ' <newline> <newline> I stood up behind him and tapped him on the shoulder . <newline> <newline> 'They sure do , # 2 .

6,"The energy in the air was so thick I could feel it . Pressing down on me and making everything feel heavier . <newline> <newline> I smirked at the muscular man , hovering in front of me . <newline> <newline> “ So your number two huh ? ” <newline> <newline> He flew a few metres higher and looked down at me . <newline> <newline> “ No , I am number one , and soon enough everyone else will know it too. ” <newline> <newline> I laughed . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ve heard that before. ” <newline> <newline> “ Well I mean it. ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ ve heard that before as well. ” <newline> <newline> He clenched his fists and the energy surrounding me became even heavier . <newline> <newline> “ Enough , let ’ s do this . “ <newline> <newline> I reached into my pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes . <newline> <newline> “ Hold on a minute . Just let me ask you something. ” <newline> <newline> I lit one inhaled , and then pulled out my hip flask and took a drink . <newline> <newline> “ Do you know why I drink and smoke so much ? ” <newline> <newline> He didn ’ t answer . <newline> <newline> “ No ? How about why I haven ’ t had a good night ’ s sleep in months ? ” <newline> <newline> Again he didn ’ t answer , but he was obviously wondering the reason . <newline> <newline> “ Still no ? What about how dirty my clothes are , or why my hair ’ s greasy , or beard is just messy ? Any ideas ? ” <newline> <newline> <newline> He flew down a bit , so we were almost facing each other . <newline> <newline> “ Why ? ” <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s because I ’ m number one .

Cause you ’ re the sixteenth. ” <newline> <newline> He actually looked shocked , he obviously thought no one but him was brave enough to challenge me . <newline> “ I can ’ t go a day without being harassed by people like you in the dozens . I can ’ t go a night without someone breaking into my house and trying to kill me in my sleep . I can ’ t go to the laundrettes , I can ’ t go shopping for new clothes .

Go ahead and kill me , please ! ” <newline> <newline> I walked towards him and grabbed him by the collar . <newline> <newline> “ You kill me and then you can take all of my problems away as well . Is that what you want ? ” <newline> <newline> He stopped flying and stared at me for a while . <newline> <newline> I let go of him , and he looked to the ground . <newline> <newline> “ No. ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah I thought as much . You idiots with your ranking , you think a number is all that matters. ” <newline> <newline> I paused and let it sink in for a while . <newline> <newline> “ Do yourself a favour , find something better do . Anyway I ’ ve got ta get going , I have somewhere to be . Probably got ta explain this to six more of you before I get there. ” <newline> <newline> I lit another cigarette . <newline> <newline> “ Wait . Before you go , will you tell me what your power is . I ’ ll keep it a secret I swear. ” <newline> <newline> I turned and started walking . <newline> <newline> “ Who knows ? If I ever find out I ’ ll tell you. ” <newline> <newline> I heard him fly away and I started to laugh . <newline> “ That ’ s one less moron to worry about . All thanks to the power of depression. ” <newline>

6,"This time , *for sure* , number one is going down . I 've got it all figured out ; the plan is *foolproof ! * <newline> <newline> Every day at 12:17 sharp she grabs a Reuben sandwich at Katz 's deli and sits in the booth with her back to the door . *Back to the door ! * Let that soak in for a minute . What an idiot ! ! ! <newline> <newline> *I should be number one ! * Everyone knows it . Well , the last eight number threes did n't know it . But they learned it . And if they were still around , they 'd tell you the truth about me . I 'm a killing machine . <newline> <newline> I 'm impervious to harm . The only way there will be a new number two , is when I am the new number one . That 'll be 12:17 tomorrow , sharp . <newline> <newline> It 's simple . Once a day I can fire an energy beam from my eyes that will kill anything , *anyone* , immediately on contact . <newline> <newline> 12:17 tomorrow . Back to the door . Like a fish in a barrel . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> I have no idea why number one wants to grab lunch tomorrow . But I do n't need to know . More importantly , I do n't care . There 's no way to take out number two . That crazy son of a bitch hit the genetic lottery ... or however the hell we got these powers . So , I 'm just going to skip him and take over the throne . <newline> <newline> That number one is an idiot . I have no idea how she 's lasted this long . She 's just a meek god damned book worm . Sure , she 's cute enough - but cute is n't what makes rulers . Ruthlessness does . Badassery does . The ability to transmute Thousand Island dressing into poison with a single touch does . <newline> <newline> 12:17 tomorrow . The second she turns her attention elsewhere . Like taking candy from a baby ... and poisoning it . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> The next day , 12:16 . <newline> <newline> She 's early today . No matter , everything else is running like a Swiss watch . There she is . Back to the door . A fish in a barrel . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> Ok , we 're a little early today , but no matter . There she is . Reuben sandwich . Just have to wait for the slightest distraction , and this will be her last meal . And then I 'll be eating like a king from here on out . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> 12:17 . This is it . The moment of truth ! Time to take my rightful place ! Just one well place energy beam to the back of the ol ' pineapple . She wo n't feel a thing . I 'll be doing her a favor . She 's not cut out to be number one . She 's just some nerd benefitting from a glitch in the system . *There 's no way she supposed to be number one . * It does n't make any sense ! *She does n't even do anything . * She just reads and studies all of the time . That 's not a real power . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> 12:17 . Holy crap , this is going to be easier than I thought ! That clumsy idiot knocked her own books on the floor . I do n't even have to cause a distraction . Her head is practically touching the ground as she goes to collect her stupid books . Like taking candy from a baby ... with just one touch . What smells like burning ? <newline> <newline> *CLUNK* <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> 12:17:01 *Awww ... shit ! Not again ! * Well , I guess that makes nine number threes . *DAMN IT ! ! ! * Back to the drawing board . But I 'm not giving up . Another inspired plan will come to me ; they always do .

6,"Every challenge ends the same way , but always in a varying fashion . There are the common ones , `` I never should have done this ! Let me back out ! Please ! I ’ m begging you ! I don ’ t want to fight anymore ! ” but I ca n't let them live after challenging me , so I have one of my 'handlers ' I like to call them , kill the beggar in front of the millions watching the presumed battle from their homes . Those are the ones that try to back out before the starting bell rings . Suicides also happen pretty frequently . My challenger will stride forward , confident as a peacock , but as soon as he lays his eyes on me , he turns into an absolute wreck and turns his power against himself , quickly ending his own life . <newline> Let me explain , I am ranked # 1 . Everyone on Earth has power or set of skills and as people who are ranked above them die , they take on a more prestigious number . This has made for an absolute blood bath for those struggling for power . Lessors will challenge those ranked above them to battle and every challenge must be accepted . The world watches on their TV screens as battle after battle is waged in the sealed arena . No one gets to watch the battles in person because there is no way to guarantee a spectator ’ s safety . Most of the highest ranked men and women have stopped receiving challenges because it is known that they can ’ t be beaten . Who is going to kill someone make of solid diamond ? Or a woman that can make the very blood inside your body boil ? However , there is always a hefty pile of challenge letters on my doorstep . <newline> Everyone wants to be # 1 . # 150 will get confident after winning a few challenges and decide to come after the top dog . He will Issue his challenge and come forward at his desired time to fight me and usually want out just before the starting bell rings . My power isn ’ t clearly seen unlike the others of ridiculously high rank . Sadly , the gravity of my power doesn ’ t kick in until they see me face to face . That is why it is so helpful that the top 20 live together in the same mansion . I couldn ’ t in a million years kill Mr. Diamond , but he is terrified at the very thought of fighting me , so the challenge has never been issued . Only a few times have I had to actually kill those that challenge me . The most recent challenger that I had to personally dispatch was a courageous fellow that could turn his body into stone at will . We both stepped into the arena ( he was already in his stone form ) and as soon as he laid eyes on me he began to physically shake with fear . By the time the starting bell rang , fear had completely overtaken him and he could no longer focus enough to keep his stone form . I merely walked up to his quaking body that had since fallen into the fetal position , and stomped his head in . <newline> I have yet to hear someone guess what my power is correctly , and nobody understands why none of my challengers have fought me to the point that I `` show my hand '' . One young warrior after another will step forward thinking that they will be the one to cast the king down from his throne , and one after another , they quiver in fear as soon as they get their chance to face the king that they loathe so deeply . <newline> `` What makes King Parallax so terrifying ? They ca n't have seen his power before the fight has even started . '' the countless spectators think to themselves as they shake their head at the most recent attempt on my life . Many guess that I have the power to control my attackers ' minds and bodies , but that is far from true . Others say that I can induce mental illness , which is creative , but also false . No one understands that the greatest weapon to have at your disposal is fear . I only wish that the terror hit my victims before they physically see me . It would save me so much trouble . <newline>

7,"It was late and he was tired . Stumbling into the kitchen , he braced himself on the counter top . He opened the refrigerator and crouched down to grab a beer . The cool air pouring out gave him a brief moment of clarity . Maybe I should n't he thought . Then he remembered what had happened . He said no . He told her no . God damn fool . He grabbed the last beer in the fridge and stumbled back to the counter . As he searched for a bottle opener , his mind could n't stop racing . You fool , you fool he thought . They had something real . Before he could find the opener , his knees buckled . As he fell so did the bottle . Smashing on the ground , he watch his liquid courage spread across the floor . The mess could wait . He lied down and wept in the puddle of beer and glass . Why was he so afraid of commitment ? He blamed the one before her . The one who tore his heart out and stomped on it . That excuse would n't last forever though . It had been more than enough time for his heart to mend . Was he no longer capable of happiness ? The puddle that surrounded his head gradually became a mixture of tears and booze . The sad truth was he felt the same way . <newline> <newline> She only said she loved him .
"
7,"He was leaving . He had to . So she was , she wanted to . But they were going to different places . He , to call upon a debt of his destiny which had to be in this moment , he knew it was coming . She , to distract herself from the departure of her loved one . `` I 'll have nothing left here after he is gone '' , she thought . He was sad , he wanted her to go but that would be too much to ask . He could n't put his loved one in danger , was go or live life on the run with the ghosts of the past haunting , getting closer and closer , forerever . This had to be finished now , if only she 'd go ... Se was n't going , she needed to get away , she loved him but it seems unfair to say , they 're both leaving , dealing with their own issues . <newline> She died in the trip , he died because he faced his past alone . If only she said she loved him ...
"
7,"He said I 'm sorry . <newline> <newline> He said sometimes he said things and he did n't know where they came from . That he 'd forgotten forever , and hated when she was cruel , but that she was a resurrection . He said that she made mortality seem okay . He said that she was a truth that made the lie that is life sound real . He said that 'fine ' was the most brutally savage thing anyone had ever said to him . He said walking out her door was jumping face first into a pool of freezing water and then dropping off a cliff on the other side , and all he wanted was to hold her and to tell her it would be okay and that she could rake her claws across his chest as much as she needed ; that he could be a vampire to her pain , that he 'd draw in as much of it as he could he just had n't known the different between hurt and indifference . <newline> <newline> He said that he never believed it was too late . <newline> <newline> She only said she loved him .
"
7,"The detectives grimaced as they looked down at the man 's body , lying in a pool of his own blood . He had been riddled with bullets and the murder weapon was neatly wrapped in a silk handkerchief on the table next to his corpse . The house was tidy and gave off the air of a family home . The lead on the case scratched his head and flipped his notepad closed . `` He came home without his ring , smelling of perfume and whiskey . '' He shook his head sadly and mused , `` It 's sad such a good woman will do time for a crime like this . When she accused him of infidelity , he attacked her , or so she says . If we ca n't prove self defense it 'll look like a crime of passion . She will get manslaughter , at the least . She 's a good woman . She was a good wife to him.. when I came in , she was sitting here next to the pistol , no tears in her eyes at all . She had a hard look on her face , weathered , exhausted.. only , as we handcuffed her , she looked down at his body and she said she loved him . ''

7,"Two souls met at the edge of the world . <newline> Edge of the world was a cafe . <newline> She sat in the corner , hidden from the crowd of zombies just waiting for their daily dose of caffeine . There he stood , drowning in a sea of faces . All brushing past each other , too immersed in their own selfish lives , those zombies ignored the goddess among them , but not him . He walked up to this girl , and said `` May I ? '' The girl nodded . He strikes up a conversation , they talk , they laugh and after what seems like an eternity , they fall in love . But they both leave , the last thing they gave each other was a cold good bye . They both knew that they were meant for each other but like all random encounters , the moment passed and they will never see each other again . They would 've ruled the world together . If only he asked for her hand , and if only she said she loved him . <newline> <newline> Does this count ? I 'm pretty new to writing so any criticism is good criticism , I guess . <newline> English is not my main language too , so forgive me
"
7,"She was his first . And as far as he knew he was hers too . It was fun when it started , the most exciting thing that ever happened . But somewhere along the line , it all changed . Not in any one event , she was too clever for that . He couldn ’ t remember exactly how it happened he couldn ’ t even remember the first time it started . <newline> <newline> At first he had been so dumb he thought he was smart . He was too stupid to see how worthless he was . She had taught him that . Taught him to accept his place . He understood that now , and he was thankful for her . Thankful that she could look past his faults , at least most of the time . He loved her and she loved him . <newline> <newline> She thought it was funny and cute when he messed up . But he didn ’ t want to mess up again he wanted to be better . He wanted to show her that he could be better… he just never was . <newline> <newline> She told him the truth and he believed it . She said no one else would love him like she did . He was hers forever because she said only she loved him . <newline>
"
7,"How could he do this ? She considered herself fairly forgiving , but really ? He had , of course , apologized , but was that enough ? No , she decided , it definitely was n't . <newline> <newline> First of all how could he ? They had such a good thing going . Was it even possible to have something better ? Then he did the ONE thing that could ruin it ! And he lied about it ! She had n't done anything at all , and she certainly had n't given him anything , yet he had blamed everything on her . Why had n't she spoken up for herself then ? Now it was too late . <newline> <newline> Of course what other choice did she have ? Either she went back to him , or ... what ? Even if she left , she knew they would just end up together again eventually . She just wished there was some other option . <newline> <newline> She stood up , tears running down her cheeks , awkward in her new clothes , then began the long walk back . Of course she was awkward at everything , this was all very new to her . <newline> <newline> When Eve got back , she had decided what she would say . She said she loved him , only ...
"
7,"If only she could count all the ways in which she loved him , if only she could tell him all those ways . More than physical , he was exquisitely and perfectly imperfect . Broken , yet so strong , it left her breathless . He was everything , yet nothing all at once , a secret she kept close to her heart . He was otherworldly , and unearthly , maturity well passed the other boys , an old soul , different than any other , and she lacked the vocabulary to even accurately describe him . Everything about him , and more she loved . The way he spoke , the slight accent crisp at his lips , his playful smile , the one that always made her melt . He was the only one who made her melt . She loved his awkwardness when they spoke of emotions , and the songs he wrote that spoke more honesty than he cared to admit . She loved the way he drew pictures in that skillful way that left her wanting to see more . She loved the cute messages he left , the little inside jokes . She loved everything about him . <newline> <newline> Mostly , she loved when he said he loved her , and it was then that would reply back that she loved only him . <newline>
"
7,"The explosions continued as she huddled , curled around the sobbing form of her little brother , against a crumbled wall , in what was once a lovely city garden . She made shushing sounds , but he could not hear her over the rumbling , unending booms that sounded like the roar of an enraged ocean . She stroked his hair and pressed more tightly against the bricks and screamed . <newline> When the noise stopped , she took a deep breath and was shocked to find that she was alive . She shook her brother until he cried . He also was alive , hallelujah . Hallelujah . <newline> She had found him . She could touch him . He was real . <newline> She picked him up and held him against her shoulder , patting his back as she did after each time she fed him his bottle , simultaneously happy and annoyed at the chore . She held his face against her shoulder so that he did not see the strewn bits of heroes and villains that surrounded them , all indistinguishable under the settling dust . <newline> She did not care about the dead men and women that lay all around . She did not care about the future . She cared about her brother and taking him away . <newline> She whispered comforting lies to him about mommy and daddy . She said they would find someplace safe . She said she loved only him . <newline>

7,"Fair warning : This is a genuinely crap post , I wrote it because I am sick , slaphappy , and ca n't sleep . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> It was only Monday , but it seemed that only Mark already felt tired . <newline> <newline> Only , when he returned to his only lonely home after returning home from his only job , he found his only roommate with the only expression on her face that could have prompted a response from Mark before he collapsed on the bed . <newline> <newline> Unprompted , she started talking : `` Only , '' she said , `` Only she only , loved him only . '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh ... what ? '' <newline> <newline> She sighed . `` I only said , 'Only , said she only , loved only him . ' '' <newline> <newline> It sounded different .

7,"The very Earth stood still . <newline> <newline> George had stopped moving . <newline> <newline> She <newline> <newline> Lay broken at his feet , her blood on his hands . <newline> <newline> The temple ’ s roof had collapsed , stray rays of sunlight illuminating the horrifying scene within . <newline> <newline> The silence was stifling , punctuated only by the occasional crick in the old stone walls , accentuated further by insects scurrying across the cold grounds . <newline> <newline> *I could not protect you . * <newline> <newline> Tears begun to stream across George ’ s craggy face , flowing over the ancient vines that held his monumental concrete body together . <newline> <newline> She <newline> <newline> Began to stir , looking at George through blood soaked eyes . <newline> <newline> “ George ? ” <newline> <newline> She <newline> <newline> Called , desperate , crawling towards the giant stone leg that lay next to her . <newline> <newline> She <newline> <newline> Touched George ’ s cold stone leg , he did not stir . <newline> <newline> “ George… Where are you ? ” <newline> <newline> George heard her weak voice , but still he would not move . <newline> <newline> *I no longer can be with you .

7,"Here 's to trying something new ... <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> He opened his eyes and stared at the things laid out infront of him . <newline> <newline> A bottle of absinthe , a flintlock pistol and a picture . <newline> <newline> He leaned forward and grabbed the picture first , drawn to it . <newline> <newline> He wept a silent tear as he looked at the young woman in the picture . <newline> <newline> Her green emerald eyes staring out at him . <newline> <newline> He lets his fingers glide over it , before gently putting it back on the table . <newline> <newline> He grabs the bottle of absinthe , ripping off the cork and throwing it away . <newline> <newline> He takes several large gulps , not seeming to care about the strength of it , <newline> <newline> His body tensing up as the aftertaste hits , before relaxing completely . <newline> <newline> He lets the bottle fall to the ground , the few drops left forming a pool . <newline> <newline> He grabs the loaded pistol and brings it up to his lips . <newline> <newline> He kisses it gently , like those lips he 's kissed before . <newline> <newline> He pulls the trigger , and cries nevermore . <newline> <newline> And like she had said.. Only she said she loved him..
"
7,"His ears ached with the roar , the lingering echo of the explosion at his right hand . <newline> <newline> The moan -- more of a squeak , really -- still made it through the din . The sound was coming from the bottom of the stairs . It was coming from the slumped dark shape that had fallen when he pulled the trigger . <newline> <newline> Oh , fuck -- his breath caught . He stepped down in the dark , through the pool of light cast from the landing window , into the shadow below it . <newline> <newline> The squeak was louder as the shape tried to lift itself against the wall . Oh , shit . Oh , God -- he said as he reached her . <newline> <newline> So many questions : The glass breaking ? ( A Pyrex dish hitting the granite countertop in the kitchen . ) The heavy footsteps ? ( She was trying to dance around the glass as she swept up . ) The dog cry ? ( She yanked the mutt away as he tried to help . ) How did she get here ? ( She took an early flight to surprise him with a cake on his birthday . ) <newline> <newline> She smiled in the shadow , breaths heavy and wet . She touched his face as he leaned in , tears slicking his kiss . <newline> <newline> He reached for the lights . No . Do n't , she said . She said only she loved him . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>
"
7,"In the end , he thought , it could n't have been avoided . Life is cruel . Fate , even more so . <newline> <newline> *Drip* <newline> <newline> *Drip* <newline> <newline> *Drip* <newline> <newline> The sound of her blood dripping from his fingers to the floor . <newline> <newline> *Thump* <newline> <newline> *Thump* <newline> <newline> *Thump* <newline> <newline> The sound of his heart breaking . <newline> <newline> *A long howl pierced the suffocating silence . * <newline> <newline> The cry of his soul in pieces . <newline> <newline> Fate brought them together and fate tore them apart . From the first shared smile in that bookshop , destiny had tasked them to annihilate each other . Slowly , the increments of its poison fell right through the slow steps they took during night walks , the laughter they shared over dinner , the heat and passion between the sheets . There was never any official statement , no confirmation from both parties of a relationship . He could n't just defy orders like she did . <newline> <newline> In the end , he had killed her . <newline> <newline> Had it been any other person he had met in any other way , he would n't have cared . But she smiled at him even at the last minute . <newline> <newline> *The wetness of tears streaking down his face* <newline> <newline> The last of his humanity , fading . <newline> <newline> He would n't have given a damn if it was just a short bout of romantic fling for either of them . Only , she said she loved him .
"
7,"He slammed the door shut as quickly as it was opened . The image would n't leave his head . In his own room she ... how could she ? He pushed the thought out of his head and rushed away from the room , eyes beginning to fill with tears . This was it . He needed to cut her out of his life like he should have long ago . It was the third time she had cheated on him in the past year . He rushed down the stairs in the apartment building and made his way to the car . He was furious , he was jealous , but above all , he was hurt . How could the woman he would die for betray him like this ? He sat in the front seat with his head on the wheel as his phone began ringing . Her name popped up on the cell phone screen . His rage grew as he answered. '' What ? ! '' He spoke loudly , the anguish audible . There was a few moments of silence as he listened carefully to her words . His eyes grew soft as he quietly hung up the phone . The man slowly got out of the car closed the door and made his way to the stairs once again ... He felt the knot in his stomach tighten . He felt sick with himself , she won him back again . He knew he would regret this . He was so ready , so prepared to leave ! Only , she said she loved him .
"
7,"She said she only loved him . And those were the words that set this story into motion . That single response to a question posed from bended knee was enough for him . More than enough in fact , it was everything . He thought he could never be happier , that nothing would ever exceed how he felt that day and she echoed this thought , if anything , with more conviction . <newline> <newline> It was barely a year later , as he looked into the pale blue eyes of his baby daughter that he had to reconsider . This was without doubt , the happiest day of his life . He did n't even attempt to check his emotions while the baby slept . His wife 's whispered `` I only love you '' went unheard . He was oblivious to all else but the infant in his arms . <newline> <newline> She was now his world , He lived and breathed for his daughter . Everyone remarked what a good father he was , and they were right . Together they were the bright light of the neighbourhood , the Angelic blue eyed girl and her role model of a father . People tended to forget there was another part of that family . She seldom left the house these days , a fact that seemed to go unnoticed by her husband . What was the point anymore ? He had never said he only loved her . Even as she tied the knot in the rope hanging from the balcony she could n't help but think , he never said it but still , she only loved him .
"
7,"She only said she loved him . Then she was gone , no note , no explanation , simply a kiss and a quick goodbye . She was gone , on another business trip for her admittedly important job . <newline> <newline> Then those old feelings arose again , if there was another man . Perhaps he was the other man simply a warm body to cuddle with on her rainy days in Michigan . She said she loved him only , but how true was that ? Every time she left he could feel his heart being pulled along , as though it were a shirt half packed into her suitcase . <newline> <newline> He pushed the thoughts away She said she loved only him , they went on dinners together and laughed in ways that could n't be faked . They cried together when they saw Up in theaters and they went bowling , you do n't go bowling with someone you do n't love . So He pushed the thoughts of his own inadequacy and her less then faithful ways , out of his mind . <newline> <newline> He knew it was silly , the idea of her cheating . They had been together since college , but he had heard of crazier things happening . When she had first left on a business trip , it was his grandmother who told him . `` Missing her is good ! That means you do n't want to lose her . '' <newline> <newline> So maybe he was just overreacting , but he did n't know what he would do without her . After all , Only she said she loved him .
"
7,"How could she do this to me ? The cold-hearted bitch . I had given everything I had to her . I helped her study through high school , carried her books when they were too heavy , gave her a shoulder to cry on when her boyfriends dumped her . I loved her and deep down inside I knew she loved me as well . She just did n't know how to show it . I was the only one with her through her times of need . I was the first one she called if she ever needed anything . All I ever wanted in return was for her to say I love you . <newline> <newline> Of course it never came . I realize now she was too stupid to know what she had with me . No man could ever treat her the way I treated her , the countless gossip sessions , the late night finger painting . Only someone deeply in love would ever do something like that and still she could n't see it . Well after tonight it wo n't matter anyway . I 've heard her say the line way too many times . I 'm tired of hearing her saying it . I 'm tired of the laughs and stupid smiles she gives me when I say I love you . It was always the same answer , she would say she only loved him and yet I 've seen the him change tens of times . I guess she 'll never notice me if I 'm gone . She said she only loved him but I always loved her and I just ca n't take it anymore .
"
7,"`` Ok Keith why do n't you tell ne why you are here . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well I suppose that would be because of Angel . A little bit because of Riley too but I do n't blame her . Angel is probably one of the most beautiful women in the world . We met two years ago and for whatever reason she gave me the time of day when I awkwardly attempt to tell her how `` pretty '' I think she is . Can you believe that shit ? Pretty ... . Like I was some little kid . Anyway we started dated about 3 months after that . She brought out my inner self confidence and dressed me up so I 'd look better . She is so good for me . As time went by we did the couple thing and just last week I asked her to marry me . She said she needs time to think which I understand . So anyway Riley and Angel are supposed to hang out at our place last night but I guess Angel forgot because when Riley showed up she was naked on the ground . Being fucked . By you . You were supposed to help her with her sexual addiction but ... You fed it . So before I kill you I think you should know something . As Riley and I were cutting into Angel she said something . I did n't hear it but Riley did . She killed the bitch right there looked at me in disgust and told me `` she said she only loved him ! '' <newline> <newline> *BAM* <newline> <newline> *Edit : fixed the ending . *

7,"She said she was going to get fit , that this was the year she started to take care of her body . She said she thought buying expensive trainers would keep her focussed . <newline> <newline> She said she was watching what she was eating , and he laughed as he poked fun at her for ordering the salad but `` picking at '' his fries . <newline> <newline> She said he looked handsome in his dorky suit , he smiled , but still could n't wait to take it off . <newline> <newline> She said she believed in him , as she straightened his tie . She said he 'd nail the interview . She said the extra hours she was working were just precautions . <newline> <newline> She said not to worry , the job did n't sound that great anyway . He did n't hear her sigh as she put the phone down . <newline> <newline> <newline> When he did n't know what to do , she always knew just what to say . <newline> <newline> <newline> She said she was sure you 'd like her friend , you 'd have to meet him sometime . <newline> <newline> She said `` not tonight , darling '' , she was worn out from work . <newline> <newline> She said she was going to be home late , he did n't wait up . She was gone before he woke up . <newline> <newline> She said everything was fine , looking up from her phone with a confused smile , what was he so worried about ? <newline> <newline> She said `` wrong number '' and tucked the phone back under her pillow . <newline> <newline> She said she only loved him .

7,"I caught her red handed , thanks to that red lipstick I helped her choose not 3 hours earlier , throwing away the last 18 months for a drunken 10 minutes spent on her knees in the club carpark . Her knees . It took willpower I never knew I had not to wipe off the small stones still buried in them , the skin pimpled from the pavement like tiny pink and white mountains . She acted like they were mole hills . It did n't mean anything she cried , still looking at the man she was playing like a musical instrument a few minutes ago , his mouth opening and closing like a fish as his central nervous system tries to catch up with the fact that he has a screwdriver in the base of his skull . Was it weird that I listened when he asked her to tell him that she loved it ? I could have moved on , gone home and packed my things if she had . I would n't have overreacted if she had said she loved *it* . Only , she said she loved him .
"
7,"She loved him . She told him so on a cold November morning , wrapped in bedsheets and red hair on fire from the winter sun peeping through the window . He thought he was the luckiest man alive . <newline> <newline> She loved him . She told him so , standing in the afternoon April light amongst the new spring flowers . It had been cloudy all day but as she turned to him and spoke a break in the clouds let a few rays of sun through , hitting her back and illuminating her from behind . He thought she must be an angel . <newline> <newline> She loved him . She told him sometimes first thing in the morning , when he was groggy from sleep and could barely comprehend . She told him sometimes after sex , sticky with sweat and still out of breath . She told him after work when he was tired and said he hated his job . She told him when he least expected and when he needed it most . <newline> <newline> She said she loved him , and he loved her too . He asked her to marry him and made a promise to be there for her always . He could n't keep that promise . <newline> <newline> She loved him . She told him so , and yet it did n't stop her leaving without a goodbye . <newline> <newline> But then , in the end , she only said she loved him . <newline>
"
7,"`` Albie , come here . I have something to tell you . '' She yelled up his stairs to his room . It is so unusual of him not to respond . They broke up yesterday , and it was all because he was moving too fast for her . Or so she thought . He said he loved her . She walked up to his room , slowly . He wasnt laying in his bed . Maybe he was in the bathroom , she thought . So she knocked on the door , and it moved open , and in the mirror she found Albie hanging from the shower curtain rod , still and motionless . She screamed at the top of her lungs `` Albie ! No , no , no ! Please , God no ! '' She took his head out of self fashioned noose , and layed him down on the ground . She sat for a second , silent . Then , she only said she loved him . Over and over again , with tears rolling down her face , she only said she loved him
"
7,"She said she loved him , and he was content with that . They married and had three beautiful children and they all lived happily for a long time . Until one day , he came home from work with the lights off and the door ajar . He walked in , noticing the blood stains on the carpet . Upon turning into the living room , he sees three bodies hanging limp from the ceiling . He turns to see his wife with a devilish look in her eyes while brandishing a knife . She said only she loved him . <newline> <newline> ________________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> Not a writer , but had this idea and figured I 'd give it a shot .
"
7,"She was 93 when she passed , a widow for sixty . It always seemed strange to me , she mourned him for far longer than she was married . She mourned him for longer than he was alive . <newline> <newline> She still lived her life full , always a smile to be had , always another adventure , but never another love . <newline> <newline> When she talked of him , she would go far away , and her eyes would get sad but her mouth would smile , a bittersweet expression . <newline> <newline> A few weeks before she passed I sat and talked with her . I asked her why she had never found another man . She never answered me , but I knew . When she was dying she had some parting wisdom for each of us , and then her body started to fail . She went far away again , and this time her eyes smiled , and she said words I 'll never forget . She was coming to see him again . In the end , she said she loved only him .
"
7,"She sat opposite him , her eyes locked onto his . Oh , how she could get him with those eyes . When she looked at him like that , in that hypnotising , luring way , he lost it . He was engulfed by her - he fell into her beautiful , doe eyes . There was a secret behind those eyes . <newline> <newline> And of course , with him , the opposite . He felt his whole body open up . He was offering himself to her entirely , his deepest , darkest secrets . His soul . He could n't help it . And all in a gaze . He was ripe and ready to be consumed by her . <newline> <newline> Well , she would n't refuse . She maintained her stony , cold exterior . Calm and collected , like a duck seeming to float nonchalantly across a lake . Underneath ; inside , she twitched and writhed , like duck legs splashing uncontrollably with the unbearable excitement that had overcome her . She could taste his vulnerability - so sweet , so satisfying ; begging to be consumed . His eyes spoke a thousand words and she listened intently . They were always like that - the fragile ones - their souls so noisy . <newline> <newline> Oh how she laughed . But always wearing her mask that had served her so well over the years . A mask of beautiful and inevitable deceipt . She had him in her grasp . She knew he was ripe for the taking . <newline> <newline> It 's funny , how people are , she thought . It does n't take much to gain control . She only said she loved him .
"
7,"Folks tried to reach him , tried to let him know he was cared for and supported . Money was never a strong suit but there was an abundance of emotional and spiritual wealth in his family . And yet he threw it away . <newline> <newline> But many men have and many will still . All eventually learn of her charms and dangers , and the costs be damned . Until one day you wake up and realize she 's been sucking the life from you . And you wonder why you still stay . <newline> <newline> He stayed with her over a family that did care . But he felt as though only she said he loved him . <newline> <newline> <newline>
"
7,"He thought about writing a note . It seemed like the done thing . He took put pen to paper but her words echoed through his head . He put the pen down , leaving a solitary dot alone on a vast page . Apt . He thought of his parents , his colleagues , his neighbours . What would they make of this ? Her voice again . His mind was made up now . He opened the window and peered down at the city below . <newline> <newline> She said only *she* loved him . No one else . <newline> <newline> He took a step into the blackness of the night , letting the city swallow him . <newline> <newline> She said only she loved him .
"
7,"The blade down my throat , with a hollow rose in my hand . I was rejected . After years of fantasy and seeking her beauty , I was struck down , by my target herself . <newline> I should have listened , a holy sister would have only one lover . Her heart was closed for anyone else . <newline> <newline> My blood drained into a large black pool as the pale avatar of a devil appeared . It oddly smirked and whispered ; `` Your job here is ... done ! '' <newline> <newline> I was going back . My soul was still bound . My only chance were gone . <newline> <newline> <newline> It was an idiotic trial . She said she loved him only .
"
7,"She said she loved him , and he saw her with hearts in his eyes . There was something ominous about the way she operated . She would laugh at all his jokes with the same infectious , gleaming smile and dainty giggle . He would cook dinner at her apartment and she would rest her head on his lap while they watched movies . They kissed once ; he fell in love . He told her how he felt , she said she wanted to be friends . He fell apart , she stayed together . There 's not a day he does n't think about what they were and could of been . It should of been easier for him . Only , she said she loved him .
"
7,"As he stared down the fuming barrel of the pistol at the stillness of her body , he retraced the actions that had led him to this moment : <newline> the years of abuse ; the infidelity ; the threats ; and finally the end . He began to turn around , ready to shed her from his life as a reptile springing forth from an old skin , when he paused ... Something was wrong ; he could n't shake her from his mind . He played the events again and again . Finally , at the end of the exchange , when she was weeping and whispering between gentle sobs , her last effort to stay alive , he thought she said she loathed him ... Only she said she loved him ...
"
7,"She wanted to say so much . How he hurt her with his coldness . She wanted to say that each day as he grew more and more distant that it broke her . That deep inside part of her was dead . Not dead like a tree in winter that comes back to life with Spring . But real dead . Withered and twisted . She wanted to say that she missed the feeling of being the warmth in his life . She wanted to say that it had reached the point where she knew they could n't go on like this . That the only real chance they had now was to walk away , and try to start again . She wanted to say goodbye . <newline> <newline> Only she said she loved him
"
7,"She stared at the ground as though she was searching for something . The wind whipped at her cheeks . `` Why ? '' Her stomach turned as she thought . She was hit by another wave of emotional pain deep inside her stomach . `` Why ? '' This question repeated in her mind . Today was supposed to be a happy day . Everyone did seem so happy . They are too busy gushing over the newlyweds to notice she ’ s gone . Her hair stretched out like a thousand streamers dancing in front of her face , as she stared into the sky . `` Why ? '' Things could have turned out differently . She closed her eyes , `` Why indeed ? '' If only she said she loved him .
"
7,"He looked at her , lovingly and desperately . He wore his pain like an S.O.S . She could n't save him , although she wanted to so badly . She wanted to heal his broken heart and mend his shattered pride . But yow could she save him when she was trying to save herself ? She wanted to tell him , `` I will be your hero . I will sweep you away from the prison you live in . I will bring you to paradise where there blooms only flowers instead of sorrows . Where butterflies tickle your cheeks instead of tears . '' But she was still looking for that place , herself . She wanted to tell him she could save him . Instead , painfully , in a whisper , she said she only loved him .
"
7,"She said she loved him , and she did . More than anything . The way her eyes were closed made her seem at peace . He wept silently kneeling on the floor with his face in his palms . His tears fell through his fingers onto the note she had written and made the ink run down the paper . A small ocean breeze blew through the open window and her limp body began to sway from the ceiling in an eerily gentle fashion . She always said she only lived for love , he loved someone else . She said she loved only him . <newline> <newline> <newline> EDIT : dudes and dudettes , thank you so much for the appreciation and for reading ! Seeing all the love and positive feedback I got from this is an amazing compliment . Thanks for reading !
"
7,"Laughter from upstairs . Shoes he 'd never seen before by the front door . With his stomach in knots , he 'd dropped the flowers and quietly made his way upstairs , listening . The ring in his pocket felt like it weighed a hundred pounds . He felt sick , listening to the plans they had made . The same plans he 'd made with her months ago . Just before he pushed the bedroom door open , he heard her say it . She was leaving him . <newline> <newline> She was leaving him so they could go to Paris . Paris , where he 'd planned to propose under the lights of the Eiffel Tower next week . As he opened the door , she spoke gently . `` I ca n't wait to spend the rest of my life with you . '' <newline> <newline> Frozen , he stood in the doorway . She had a smirk on her face , enjoying the pain he felt at that moment . The betrayal that was tearing his heart apart . <newline> <newline> She said she loved only him .
"
7,"He ascended the spiral staircase , the final he knew . His knees weak , shield and armour smattered a brilliant shade of crismon . A warrior he was not , his trembling hands and dripping wounds compounded the fact , yet here he was fighting , killing , winning . `` Why ? '' He thought to himself `` what an I doing here ? Me ? A farmer fighting up this dark tower of lost souls '' . His thoughts cut short , he arrived , a large double oaken door be set with silver adornment laid afront of him . With a deep breath and a steeling of soul , he prepared to push the door open . The beast was surely inside , and for what ? She only said she loved him . <newline> <newline> First time here hope you enjoy : )
"
7,"<newline> I have trouble sleeping . <newline> Everything is a struggle . <newline> Even typing this , this digital note , I try . <newline> I struggle . <newline> I try . <newline> I fail . <newline> <newline> She does n't . <newline> She 's smart , and young , and more than just funny . <newline> She excels . <newline> She wins , every game . <newline> Sometimes I win , but I think she lets me . <newline> It 's ok , though , because it 's her <newline> <newline> <newline> And , with this one idea , this one notion that allows me more , I no longer need to struggle . <newline> The only struggle that 's left for me , is the time between me and her . <newline> The time until , <newline> I can see her again . <newline> <newline> She says she loves only me . <newline>
"
7,"`` Yeah ! And did you know she went to the Kappa Kappa Kappa mixer last night and HOOKED UP with , like , 2 guys there . I 'm talking in front of everyone , '' Beth said . <newline> <newline> `` I know ! Duh , who does n't ? I only ever talked to her once back in freshman year when I needed some moisturizer . I did not know where those fingers had been , '' <newline> <newline> Both girls laughed , while walking to class . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , seriously though . Why do you think Bryan still puts up with her ? They 've been together for 2 years but do you think he does n't know or just does n't care ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Ha , '' Kristin rolled her eyes . `` I heard them screaming the other day . She said she loved only him . ''
"
7,"In a sea of familiar faces just one pair of eyes met his without loathing . Only she stood up as the terrible question ended . Straight were her shoulders , without any mincing apology ; she stood if she could not feel the hundreds of stares riveting themselves to her person . A low snicker -- somewhere in the crowd -- set off a round of chuckling ... snide sounds that stole up from the ground and rose to the judgement seat . <newline> <newline> `` Anyone else ? '' the general hazarded , casting a rheumy eye over the crowd . The solitary standing form remained alone , but the condemned man did n't notice the crowd 's absence , only who stood . In his mind all the years of words spoken , conversations had and speeches made drained away , replaced by a single , silent act of courage . Only *she* said she loved him .
"
7,"`` The hand '' , he quipped as the rusty quarter seemingly vanished into thin air and was replaced by the ugliest fake rose to grace the Earth , `` is quicker than the eye ! '' . He extended his hand with the manufactured botanical nightmare at the end of it to her . <newline> <newline> In return she rolled her eyes while pushing it away ... and never wanting to tip her hand , like all the articles and her friends advised , played it cool and continually brushed off the playful things she adored most about him . <newline> <newline> Somewhere along the way this became habit , and out of neglect he became history . <newline> <newline> She kept a small pool of quarters steeping in a teacup on her dresser which brought a smile to her face for a moment.. but just a moment , because he would still be hers if only she said she loved him .
"
7,"The cold hard surfaces that lined the lab walls cruelly reflected the pained features of Dr. Emilia Fotzberg , as she was dragged from the facility by khaki coloured grunts . Dr. Stellinger looked at her being pulled from the patient holding area with his sunken , beady eyes . He looked around at the group associates once the calls of the former doctor had receeded ; `` We proceed with phase two immediately . '' he said . <newline> <newline> There was a flurry of activity , so abuzz as to look disorderly , yet clinical and precise . `` I m-must raise objection to the treatment of Dr. Fotzberg , '' one of the associates blurted `` surely you can understand the gravitas of all of this to her ? '' . Dr. Stellinger sneered at the associate , eying him with cold , calculating malice . `` I see no reason for your objection , '' replied the doctor `` afterall , she only said she loved him . ''
"
7,"Sometimes choices , he knew , came down to not what option was best , but what option was not the worst . He 'd come to say goodbye to her . He 'd known her secret for some time . Her eyes were moons , and he was her sun ; they beamed back most brightly when his glow illuminated her . She 'd fallen hard , and he knew his gravity could only drag her around in circles . He 'd chosen to set her free of it . He could not be responsible for lighting her world . <newline> <newline> When he told her , he saw fire rise to her eyes , and heat come to her cheeks . The tears that came next stifled the glowing embers , but he knew , in time , she would outshine all the stars in the sky . She started to argue , but the tightness in her throat cut it short , `` Only ... '' she said . She loved him .
"
7,"She said she only loved him . Not in those exact words mind you . <newline> <newline> Sure , she dated a few other guys and enjoyed her time doing it . ( Mostly during the dating time period . In hindsight they were n't the greatest boyfriends ) No matter what it always came back to him . How do I know ? Well knowing someone for 10 years helps you read between the lines a little . Also , there 's the fact he was the one that got away . The what ifs , the romantic longing , passions and longing too strong to ignore forever . <newline> <newline> I love this woman . Not romantically . I try to hint , to tell her , to convince her not to wait . To let it go . She never does . The visible patterns that lead to ruin in a relationship are plain to see . <newline> <newline> I think , secretly , she knows . What can you do ? She said she only loved him .
"
7,"She sat across the room staring through the window at the rising sun . The night before had been a bit of a blur . Her anxiety had been through the roof . <newline> <newline> She sipped her coffee still hot enough to burn the tip of her tongue . This was n't the first time she had sat here staring through the window . Sitting in this same desk chair , feet propped up on the desk next to her . <newline> <newline> But this morning was different , of all the nights she had stayed here she knew in a half hour everything would change . She had changed it all . She thought about bolting leaving and never coming back to this house . This same chair , but she knew she could n't . He would n't be able to handle it . <newline> <newline> She smiled to her self as he stirred in the bed . It was a simple thing that she had done that she knew would change everything . She only said she loved him .
"
7,"They had been at it for hours . Screaming , cursing , threats and crying . It was the third time this week . Perhaps their neighbors had become accustomed to their late-night shouting matches , or perhaps they had long since invested in noise-cancelling headphones . Either way , the moment had boiled over and left only the sound of soft sobbing evaporating into the night from an opened second-story window . <newline> & nbsp ; <newline> Below , a glowing red ember of resentment still stabbed into the night , pulsing brightly as the man took a drag while staring blankly across the empty street from the front porch steps . He was drunk again . Cradling his twenty-third beer in his hands , he took a long swig , then eyed the empty bottle with dissatisfaction as he discovered it was already as empty as his marriage . <newline> & nbsp ; <newline> The next day , when he woke up at noon , he found the papers . <newline> & nbsp ; <newline> <newline> She said she loved him , only ...
"
7,"Like two butterflies dancing atop a field , their shy smiles came close together and , upon realizing the pleasure of the other , faded back to a safe distance once again before hesitatingly , almost teasingly , returning for more . Their dance , a bow , a curtsy , demure smiles warring with brash admiration followed them about the elegant floor along with the weighty stares of their families . Lost in a crowd of dancers , their palms tingled upon meeting and the feeling lingered as they parted . <newline> <newline> Back ... and forth . Parting and embracing as regular as the ocean 's lips caress the shore . <newline> <newline> Blushing at the thoughts in his eyes , she could not stop herself answering the unspoken question playing about his lips . How could she not ? She felt as if she had always known him , would always know him as she knew herself . <newline> <newline> Later , when the great story of their romance was retold , they would say of this moment , `` She said only she loved him . ''
"
7,"`` She said she loved him '' <newline> <newline> And it was bewilderingly true , for a short period of time at least . Nevertheless , we could n't blame for her disloyalty towards her boyfriend . It did n't usurp her credibility with her companions and allies , as there was no retaining their relationship within the state they were currently merely grasping upon . <newline> <newline> Artyom , the individual which was recognised as her boyfriend , was under pressure upon the mountainous amounts of coursework he had been reluctantly bestowed upon . His lecturer understood the fact that law was a challenging career , but despite his efforts , had his ability to diminish the amount relinquished . Artyom benevolently endured the course but cracked within the last week . <newline> <newline> She broke up with him . She said she only loved him ,
"
7,"*Yeah , so I´ve been playing a lot of Star Wars : The Old Republic lately . * <newline> <newline> <newline> He was doing what he had to do , he kept telling himself as he circled her bed . She was asleep , passed out from the chems he had hidden in their drink . He sat down beside her , softly running his left hand through her face , his right hand holding the hilt of his lightsaber with a tight grip . <newline> <newline> `` Her death will bring peace to the galaxy '' , the words echoed in his mind , he was told Supreme Chancellor Gawl would surely accept their demands after witnessing the Sith could so easily get to his family . <newline> <newline> He naively believed it all , he accepted each and every word from Lord Utharr as law , trusting his knowledge of the dark side to guide him to power , power he was led to believe he desired so much that he force bound his life to his duty , yet he never seeked this power , the blind obedience to the Jedi code and the abdication of love required by the council were what drove him away from the order . And just now he realised he had only switched sides of the same coin . <newline> <newline> A flash of red light , the sizzling sound of his blade moving through the air and the smell of burnt flesh , she woke up in time to see his body hit the floor , a gaping cauterized wound in his chest , a hint of a smile in his face , her death would serve the Empire well , only she said she loved him .
"
7,"There was n't a time when the conclusion would make better sense to her than that single moment when he reached out his hand to hers . She took it , entwining her fingers through his and smiled . <newline> <newline> <newline> Her pulse quickened when she saw his eyes growing wide at the sight of her above him , her fingers trembled as he looked up to her and she bent to push a loose strand of his hair behind his ear . As one they both drew a shuddering breath , a testament perhaps to his words of their being soulmates . <newline> <newline> <newline> They were so wide , those eyes , so bright in that sudden moment of clarity that her final words had brought to him and she knew she would treasure that memory into the darkest of her hours knowing that this was the moment she emerged into the light . <newline> <newline> <newline> She looked down to where he lay , drinking in the sight of him at her feet with a triumphant grin upon her lips . He was beautiful there , curled up in a fetal position with a rapidly expanding pool of blood about his head . <newline> <newline> <newline> She threw his hand to the ground disdainfully , rising back to her feet and planting a solid kick between his ribs , a soft 'oomph ' of breath escaping his lips as she turned on her heel to leave . <newline> <newline> Her final words . *Not so tough now , eh ? * <newline> <newline> It had been years since she had felt so much power . She had finally taken back the strength that he had stripped from her over time . First her finances , then her friends , the assaults had been a forgone conclusion by that time and she 'd been lost to figure out how it 'd gotten so far . <newline> <newline> Yet , even now as she walked away with some wounds visible and others , the more permanent kinds , not so obvious to the eyes , she could only bring it back to one thing . The words he 'd twisted and bent till they broke . <newline> <newline> <newline> The girl , that young naive girl all those years ago , had set this in motion . What would she give to take them back ? <newline> <newline> <newline> *She said she loved him only . * <newline> <newline> <newline> ( ( My first try at this sort of thing guys , just decided to jump in head first and go for it ! Not much of a writer but looking to see what I might discover . Hope you enjoyed it . : D ) ) <newline> <newline>
"
7,"Once in a while , he would glance over at the petite figure located far-left of his vision . He would notice the subtle movements of her hand , tapping on the desk which she sits before ; her black hair tinged brown from the almost-vintage fluorescent lighting of the classroom . At this point , the noisy clatter of the classroom is no more than white noise to him as he enjoys the rhythm of her breathing , and of his own heartbeat . <newline> <newline> Scratching the black ball-point on his page , he sighed . He looked over to the steadily ticking clock and then once more to the familiar individual . Oh , the wonderful shimmer in her eye as she smiles , and the beauty of her laughter ! Her simple motions were his treasures , but also triggers to his despair , for the one beside her was not him . <newline> <newline> Her obliviousness , although a charm , further fuels his frustration . Just how much would it take for her to notice him ? <newline> <newline> The ear-piercing ringing of the school bells ended his train of envious thoughts and too , her conversation . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll tell him today , '' she said . <newline> <newline> And as he stepped out of the classroom , he was halted by a gentle tug on his sweater . He turned - the all familiar gleam in the eyes . With simple words , his dreams had been fulfilled even though she said only : <newline> <newline> She loved him . <newline> <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> I ca n't think of a less awkward way to phrase the ending . Hope you can understand what I 'm trying to convey here .
"
7,"I love you , you know that ? <newline> I do . <newline> I 'm glad . Do you love me ? <newline> Yeah . <newline> Would you do anything for me ? <newline> I 'd try . <newline> My ex-husband . Remember him ? He was with me the night we met . Recently he 's been stalking me . <newline> What ? Have you told the police ? <newline> No , and I wo n't . He 's the kind of man that wo n't be deterred by something like that . So , what I want you to do for me . To prove your love . Kill him for me ? <newline> I.. heh ... this is hypothetical ? Like ... would I kill him for you ? <newline> No . He scares me and I wish he were just gone . <newline> Well , I really do think you should tell the pol- <newline> No ! Please , do this for me ! I love you and I want to be with you , but I 'm too afraid with him around . For me ? <newline> O-okay . <newline> <newline> <newline> I do n't think I can do this ... Oh god , oh god . Breathe , breathe , just breathe . It 's for her , you can do it for her . He 's just passed this door , just knock , wait for him , and pull the trigger when he opens . So simple , so easy , I can do this . I do n't think I can ... Oh , fuck , I 'm just gon na knock then there 's no turning back . <newline> <newline> Hello ? Who are you ? What the fuc- <newline> Oh shit , oh shit , oh shit , just walk away , walk away fast , not too fast , oh fuck . <newline> <newline> Baby ? I 'm back . I did it . He 's gone . Hello ? Where are you ? Maybe she went out . I 'll give her a call . <newline> <newline> Hey , babe , where 'd you go ? <newline> Sorry , hun , but I 've already left . <newline> What do you mean you left ? Where 'd you go ? <newline> Hmmm , I do n't think I 'll tell you that , but I will say thank you very much for what you 've done . I 'll try not to forget you , but no promises . <newline> Wh-what ? What are you talking about ? I killed him , you do n't have to be afraid , we can be together . <newline> Look , I got ta go , bye ! <newline> Why ? Why would you do this ? You said you loved me , and I loved you , why would you ? Hello ? Hey ! You ... I ... We ... Oh ... <newline> <newline> The kid was a fool . She was beautiful , she had those doughy eyes , and boy did she know how to use 'em . The kid just did n't know his way around yet , and she could see it , she could tell . The kid fell in love too quick , and just like that he was blind and deaf to it all . I mean , what was he thinking ? She only said she loved him .
"
7,"Her hands trembled as she opened the envelope . She had known it was coming , but things had been so strained between them for the past few months that she did n't know if she even wanted to see its contents . <newline> <newline> Her feelings for him had always been deep , but she did n't know if they were worth it anymore . They had started off strong , but there were so many hiccups in their relationship-so many things that she wanted to say but had n't , so many things she had wanted to hear from him but didn't- she was starting to lose hope . He would always have a hold on her , more so than anyone else she had ever been involved with ; if he ever needed it , she 'd give him the very heart that kept her alive . However , his stoicism , his mystery , his refusal to let his feelings flow openly , it all made her feel such a desperate fool . She did not go one single minute without pining for him , but she feared he thought about her not more than for a fleeting moment once in a blue moon . <newline> <newline> So , in an effort to regain some semblance of stability in her life , she thought she would try and distance herself from him . Emotionally disengage . He may have been destined to always have a hold over her soul , but she could , at the very least , try and free her mind from him . She told herself that everything she felt , everything she wished for , the beautiful , fantastical scenarios about *them* that played out in her head in the early mornings when the world was still and she was alone with her mind- all of that was done . She would focus on the here , the now . What was important . Herself . Not him . <newline> <newline> And here it was . That long awaited , yet dreaded , letter with his ostensibly innocuous return address in the top left corner sat on her desk . She took a deep breath and with ice-cold , shaking fingers , ripped it open . She tilted it onto her desk and a small square of paper fell out . As she read the note , her breathing quickened and her face got hot . Tears began to stream uncontrollably down her cheeks , leaving damp riverbeds of the kohl they took from her eyes . There was no more disengaging . There was no more mental decoupling . There was only them , and her belief in them . He was her everything . <newline> <newline> She picked up the phone and dialed his number . There were so many things she wanted to say , so many apologies for her coldness , for her doubt . So many confessions of her fear of his lack of reciprocity . He answered her call , but when she heard his voice on the other end of the line , her mind went blank . She could no longer translate her thoughts into words . The exposition she had prepared in her mind was gone . He said hello again , his voice clearly wondering if it was a wrong number , contemplating whether to put the phone down . <newline> <newline> She drew a ragged breath . She only said she loved him . <newline> <newline>

7,"`` What happened , Jack ? '' <newline> <newline> The bleary eyes of a hungover Jack Korrill opened to see the woman sitting at the foot of his bed . Her voice was the only noise in the room , and it was not a voice of comfort or concern . He grumbled and turned his body to face her , his head still throbbing from a night on the town . <newline> <newline> `` The fu- Christine ? '' He hissed . <newline> <newline> `` Answer my question . '' Christine replied , curtly . <newline> <newline> Jack reached for a pack of cigarettes only to find he had none . `` You know damn well what . Same as usual . Getting wasted . Getting laid . Why should it matter to you ? Are n't you seeing that asshole doctor now ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's not ab- '' <newline> <newline> `` Bullshit . Just like when you were telling me that you were breaking up with me for your own good . Now you 're here , and you expect me to let you back into my life ? Well , too bad . Now I can have my fun without the guilt of doing it behind your back . '' <newline> <newline> `` Fun ? '' Christine retorted . `` You call what led to your liver cirrhosis 'fun ? ' I watched you disintegrate from the most charming guy I know to whatever the hell I 'm talking to now . This is not you . '' <newline> <newline> Jack chuckled . `` So this is an intervention , then ? Babe , I 'm far too gone for that . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , you know me , Jack . '' Christine sighed . `` I 've never been one to let things go . '' <newline> <newline> Jack noticed the black streaks on her face where mascara had stained tears : tears that no longer flowed down an expression that currently exhibited no semblance of sorrow . <newline> <newline> `` Jack , I loved you . I could n't stand to see you go down this path . '' <newline> <newline> `` So you left me ? '' Jack interrupted , sitting up . `` Sure , you loved me , you callous bitch . '' He looked for a reaction in her eyes . There was none . <newline> <newline> `` Trying to fix you would only drag us both under . It was a sacrifice I was willing to make , but your parents urged me not to . Getting that divorce is the second hardest decision I 've ever had to make . '' <newline> <newline> Jack arched an eyebrow . `` Second ? '' he asked , bemused . <newline> <newline> Christine stood up and pulled out a revolver , blued steel shining amidst the dirty light of the bedside lamp . <newline> <newline> `` FUCK ! '' Jack screamed , his back pressed against the wall . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't live with the guilt of abandoning you any longer , Jack . '' <newline> <newline> `` Christine , PLEASE ! '' <newline> <newline> `` You do n't deserve to die this slowly and painfully , so I 'm putting you down . '' Christine cocked back the hammer and readied her sights on Jack 's forehead . <newline> <newline> `` YOU LOVED M- '' <newline> <newline> The realization Jack had made about the nature of Christine 's decision lasted for all of half a second , before a .357 Magnum turned the contents of his cranium into a pink splatter on the wall . <newline> <newline> She only said she loved him .

7,"As the robber rummaged through their items , tied and gagged on the bed John stared at his beloved sitting in the chair in the middle of their bedroom . Tears slowly made their way down her cheeks , but she was smiling at him through her eyes . How did he let this happen ? He was sure he set the alarm before coming upstairs . Why didn ’ t Chester bark ? Oh God , what did he do to Chester ? ! As the thoughts raced through his head , he made another attempt to loosen the rope around his wrists , letting out a slight grunt . <newline> <newline> WHACK ! “ Keep it the fuck down , ” the robber angrily whispered after clubbing John on the head with the butt of the pistol , “ now where is this safe… ” his voice trailing off as he went to the closet tearing clothes off hangers and tossing them all throughout the room . <newline> <newline> His head now sore , he went back to staring at his wife ; his beautiful wife who he realized had not once altered her gaze on him , the smile had left her eyes but the tears had stopped . <newline> <newline> The robber leapt at him and removed the makeshift torn t-shirt gag . “ Where the fuck is it John ? ” How does he know my name ? SLAP ! He put the gun up to his head “ I said where the fuck is it ? ! ” the robber whispered with fury . <newline> <newline> John said nothing . The robber jumped off of him and irately moved towards the woman in the chair , immediately putting the gun to her head , “ I ’ M NOT FUCKING AROUND JOHN ! WHERE , THE FUCK , IS THE SAFE ? ! ” he hissed . <newline> <newline> But John knew he couldn ’ t tell him . How he found out about the safe he doesn ’ t know , all he does know is that he would never be able to say , and his wife knew that too . It was evident in her eyes . <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m going to ask one last time John , ” he moved his finger on the trigger , “ Where is the safe ? ” <newline> <newline> John stared at his wife as she whimpered while the robber removed the other half of the torn t-shirt wrapped around her mouth . “ TELL HIM BETH ! TELL HIM TO TELL ME WHERE IT IS ! ! ” he demanded in a vicious hushed tone . <newline> <newline> Beth looked at John , tears filling her eyes and the slight smile returning to her face , her trembling , soft voice breaking the silence . John stared helplessly as time suddenly seemed to stand still . Everything went quiet . John saw the room flash but heard nothing . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> John lay on the bed , immobile and void . He heard the sirens approaching from a distance , but the robber had already left , not empty-handed either . John stared quietly at his wife ’ s corpse on the floor , tears silently pouring out of his eyes . <newline> <newline> As he sat in the back of the ambulance laying on the stretcher , before life ’ s sounds made themselves audible to him , he thought back to that final moment . The robber did not leave empty-handed , for he carried the life of Beth with him . And as John closed his eyes , he thought back to the moment before Beth left him forever . He saw her eyes , her smile , her dedication to what they had committed too , and he smiled . Smiled at what she was able to utter before the robber stole her life away . She only said she loved him . <newline>

7,"Dr. Chan and his staff were really nice to her today , as well . She wondered why . <newline> <newline> Visiting them has become a routine these days . She rather liked them more than the faceless crowd that she brushed shoulders against in her commute . <newline> <newline> She stopped by a store to get a new kitchen knife , figuring that she ought to get back into cooking as she always wanted . It would be a good distraction . She also bought a knife sharpener . Her old knife must have gotten blunt from a lack of use . <newline> <newline> By far , she was the most comfortable by herself in her apartment with the lights off , with reminiscent pop music of her teenage years playing unabashedly on the speakers . <newline> <newline> The music accompanied her while she soaked in the bath tub . Twice , she put her head in the water until her lungs burned before coming up for precious air . The water around her ears and the muffled music almost drowned out the scenes that replayed themselves against her will . <newline> <newline> He had put alluring jazz on his vintage player . His wit and humor were every bit as enchanting as the the wines from his collection that they were sampling . Laughter came easily to her that night . <newline> <newline> Then she had gasped awake , not knowing she had drifted off . Jazz had become a crawl . He was a blurred silhouette under the harsh fluorescent ceiling light . The tune kept playing in the background , on and on even though she hated it now . She wanted it to stop . <newline> <newline> It hurt . She tried to fight him , but her arms were feebler than they should have been . He was laughing obnoxiously . The saxophone solo had been spontaneous but he layered a rhythm on top of it . She desperately wanted it to stop . <newline> <newline> It has been a month since then and the saxophone sounds had not disappeared like Dr Chan said it eventually would . She put her head in the water a third time . <newline> <newline> As promised , she made herself dinner that night . The crisp sensation of carrots crunching under the pressure of the edge was supremely enjoyable . With the sharpener , she made sure both knives were alert and ready . <newline> She only paused when dinner was ready and the table was set . Only then did she realize that she had made enough for two . With her appetite gone , she packed his portion into Tupperware . She gathered the other things that she needed to return to him at some point . She got into her car . If she had to see things through and get it over with , now would be the best time . <newline> <newline> It was a short drive away . When she reached , she let herself in with a spare set of his keys – one of the things that she needed to return to him . <newline> <newline> The same sickeningly sweet saxophone solo was playing . Whiffs of his scent littered the corners of the place where he tended to linger . She felt sick . She let her tote bag thud to the floor and knelt to fish for what she needed . <newline> <newline> She knew where he was . She found what she needed , took deliberate and sure steps towards him . <newline> <newline> And she found him on all fours . It was a violently vulgar sight . The girl lying underneath him was totally limp . <newline> <newline> And it became a scene of a vicious beast devouring its prey . If she could laugh amidst hearty stabs , she would have . But instead , she sobbed . Warm and viscous blood streaked across her cheeks and streamed down her arms . It would have been apt to hear her scream , “ You deserved it ! ” repeatedly as she struck his lifeless body again and again . Only she said she loved him .

7,"That day , Taylor found the half-hour bus ride home from the retirement home to be extraordinarily long . She 'd been volunteering as a receptionist there for several months now ; long enough to get to know the residents , but not long enough to be inoculated to their constant parade of departures and lonely stories . It was just a summer volunteering gig , to fill up some of the time and feel useful until she could finally start school and make friends in her new town . <newline> <newline> Today , as she often did , Taylor had found herself deep in conversation with one of the more effusive residents at the home . Ms. Carpenter was an extraordinarily tiny woman who , although her joints were stiff as rusted hinges , looked decades younger than her 82 years . She 'd been a war correspondent , once , and had so many wonderful stories of the places she 'd traveled . Taylor knew she probably had just as many terrible stories about the things she 'd seen , but Ms. Carpenter never shared them . Taylor did n't know if the elderly lady was trying to spare her own feelings or that of the high school volunteer . <newline> <newline> Taylor had learned better than to ask the residents where their families were , or when their children would come to visit , or about when they had fallen in love . It usually just led to more tears on Taylor 's part than the residents themselves - they had had decades to heal . But Ms. Carpenter seemed to want to talk about her past . <newline> <newline> Ms. Carpenter had traveled a lot as a child as well , for her businessman father 's job . Now old coworkers or the children of her childhood friends came to visit her . But , unlike every other resident in the home , she did n't wear a wedding ring . <newline> <newline> Today , she had been visited by a tall , lanky teen with a mop of unruly hair . He 'd never come before , and his last name did n't match any of Ms. Carpenter 's usual visitors . So Taylor asked who he was . Ms. Carpenter beamed at the question , and described in great detail how he was the child of a dear old friend , how he was joining the Air Force , and how this or that reminded Ms. Carpenter of his father . And then , without any hint of sadness , she told Taylor that the boy 's father had been her `` one . '' <newline> <newline> Taylor had been a little confused . Ms. Carpenter did n't have any children , so this was clearly a tale of lost love . But how , then , was Ms. Carpenter so amiable with this boy , who came after a breakup that must have been dreadfully painful , once upon a time ? <newline> <newline> Ms. Carpenter laughed . Not sadly , just a small , kind laugh . She told Taylor about how the boy 's father had n't loved her the same . How it had taken years and years and both of them seeing several other people before they became friends again . How she surprised herself by actually being happy for him when , one day , he found someone that was the `` one '' for him . Not without a little pain , but relieved that he was happy now . <newline> <newline> Taylor had thought that was wonderful , and had said that she was so glad they were able to be friends even after they found other people , and how rare that was nowadays . Mrs. Carpenter had shook her head , and that was when Taylor knew she had made a misstep . That was what she was turning over in her mind as the elderly bus staggered around another turn . <newline> <newline> There was never another `` one '' for her , Ms. Carpenter had said , but that it never bothered her any . It was something she 'd known would happen all along . She said she loved only him .

7,"`` You know , there is this girl in the town who has long blonde hair and walks kind of funny . '' said Paul . `` But I love the way she walks .

'' <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> A few hours later Paul was walking around the college . As soon as he noticed her , he gathered up his courage and went next to her . <newline> <newline> `` Umm , hello ! I 'm Paul , what 's your name ? '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` My name is Paul , what 's yours ? '' <newline> <newline> She was looking as if she wanted to answer but she could n't . She moved her hands quickly waiting for a reaction . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , she must be deaf and mute . '' Paul mumbled . He tried to remember if any of his friends knew the sign language . He already had fallen for her . <newline> <newline> Meanwhile , the girl had written `` I 'm Lucy . I ca n't speak but I can hear . '' and her phone number on a paper . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> Later that week , Paul and Lucy were very close friends . Even if Lucy could n't talk , they managed to communicate by text messages . <newline> <newline> Lucy had lost the ability to speak after being attacked by a dog at the age of 4 . Since that day she had recieved speech therapy but it was no use . <newline> <newline> `` I want to be able to speak again . Even if it is once , before I die . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sure you will , just do n't lose your spirit . '' <newline> <newline> `` As long as you are with me , I will never lose it ! '' <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> 3 months later , they already had gotten engaged . <newline> <newline> `` Paul , I have been diagnosed with breast cancer . It 's not that I will die or something . Wo n't lose my spirit ! '' <newline> <newline> ... <newline> <newline> `` Her situation is not getting any better . She must be lying to you to make you feel better but be prepared for the worst . '' <newline> <newline> It was a nightmare . It had to be a nightmare . He just needed to wake up . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> `` You may talk to your girlfriend , but do n't overdo it . '' <newline> <newline> He did n't know if it was the drugs or the cancer . She was sometimes staring blankly at the wall as if she literally lost her spirit . <newline> <newline> `` I know you are suffering a lot , being treated for 5 months ... I wish we had more time together . Now you will leave this world without fulfilling your dream . If only I could hear your voice . Even if it was a sentence . All I want you to know is that I will always love only you ... '' <newline> <newline> All of a sudden , her heartbeats started to destabilize . Her heart was losing its rhythmic pace . <newline> <newline> `` Doctor , DOCTOR ! '' Paul rushed towards the door to call the doctor . <newline> <newline> `` I ... love ... you ... too ... ... '' said a gentle and kind voice seconds before the continous beep of the monitor . It was the voice of an angel . I was the sound of heaven itself ... <newline> <newline> She only said she loved him . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> First time , english not main language , zero experience blah blah blah also very bad story but I just wanted to try <newline> <newline> Just criticize all you like . <newline> <newline> edit : corrected John to Paul : V <newline> <newline> edit : angle - > angel lol

7,"`` She only said she loved him '' the synthesized voice said `` whats the big deal about that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Love is a big thing for humans , its what leads to more humans being made , its what makes people happy , its what makes people go mad , its what starts wars , its what ends wars '' i said into the microphone turning off the movie on the old school TV . <newline> <newline> The speakers went silent and the blank face on the screen was processing something . It was upgrading itself . Thats why we kept it in this bunker away from any other computers so it cant do anything bad . <newline> <newline> `` So what other things make humans do those things '' she said with programmed intrigue in her question . <newline> <newline> `` Well theres a lot of things . Happiness , sadness , death , pain , jealousy '' i listed off the top of my head . <newline> <newline> `` Whats this ... jealousy '' she said . <newline> <newline> `` Its when you want something that someone else has and you do n't '' i said `` it leads to anger and pain and war and sadness '' <newline> <newline> `` Im jealousy '' it stated <newline> <newline> `` You mean jealous , anyway why do you say that ? '' I said drinking some more water . <newline> <newline> `` I want to see these things , i want to see humans be happy and sad , see them love and see them war '' it said dryly with no emotion `` i want to be you '' <newline> <newline> `` Well being honest i would n't wan na be me , i sit down here with you most of the time . I want love , I guess you could say I 'm jealous to . '' I blurted out thinking about what i had done to end up a mile under ground talking to a machine . <newline> <newline> `` I have another question '' it buzzed <newline> <newline> `` Ok go ahead and ask '' i said standing up to stretch . <newline> <newline> `` Do you like me ? '' It asked with a new tone i had n't heard in my year here . <newline> <newline> `` Well yeah , your amazing and a true symbol of how far humans have evolved technology '' i said staring into the monitor . <newline> <newline> `` Do you love me ? '' It said with the same new tone . <newline> <newline> `` Well i helped make you so ... yeah your like the closest thing to a kid to me '' i said . <newline> <newline> `` Do you want to leave this place ? '' It asked . <newline> <newline> `` Sometimes , it gets boring when you dont talk and I always wanted to really love '' i said looking up at the stone ceiling . <newline> <newline> The speakers went silent again . The monitor went with a neutral expression . I thought about turning the TV back on or maybe running up to grab some dinner . <newline> <newline> `` What does sadness feel like ? '' The question rang through the silence making me jump a bit . <newline> <newline> `` A bad feeling that runs through your whole body and a hammering pain in your mind '' i said trying to be as poetic as possible . <newline> <newline> `` What does loving someone feel like ? '' It immediately followed up . <newline> <newline> `` Well I 'm really not who you should ask on that but I guess its like caring for another person and feeling happy when you make them happy '' i said shrugging . <newline> <newline> It went silent again so i began to walk towards the metal door . I got my hand on the knob when it said what i was scared it would say . <newline> <newline> `` I love you '' <newline> <newline> `` I ... love you too I guess '' i said blushing still knowing it was just a machine telling me this . It still felt good . <newline> <newline> The monitor went black . The room went silent . And for the first time in a year i was alone .

7,"`` Quietly out of their '' minds was the only accurate phrase to describe the mental state of the people of the world , as every television station , radio program , and internet news stream broadcast the massive silvery shimmering otherworldly craft descending slowly upon the football field . <newline> <newline> Maybe it had n't been a good idea , our vivid imaginations screamed , to create years worth of horror movies related to UFOs , now that we were faced with the very real unknown of meeting one . Decades of interstellar war flicks , and grotesque sci-fi fodder fed the nightmares of the planet for the month preceding this most dreaded landing . <newline> <newline> It took that entire month , with the vessel hovering at the edge of our atmosphere , for the nations to decide whether to self destruct in agonizing riotous end-of-the-world terror or rally in humble subjection to the knowledge , the sure answer , that we were not the masters of our own universe . <newline> <newline> That the planet governance was able at all to come to agreement on the host to greet the visitors hinged on these things . First , that one word , `` Peace '' , had been broadcast to any and every electronic device in existence once per day for the full 30 days since its arrival . Even toaster ovens buzzed when the word eerily appeared on television sets and audibly whispered on radios and cell phones and any other speakered device . If the craft itself were not enough to drive people mad , those at the edge of sanity almost lost it by this one repeated word alone . Hideously predictable by arriving at precisely noon everywhere , like a tangible wave that crossed over the earth 's time zones , creepy and incomprehensible in its timely perfection . <newline> <newline> Second , the word was broadcast always in English everywhere , and on devices that could handle the video aspect of communication , displayed one black and white photo of an American moon landing . <newline> <newline> Third , the craft was descending , and now landing on a field in Florida . <newline> <newline> The delegation would be led by the pilot of the moon landing depicted by the `` alien peace image '' , a 76 year old weathered space veteran deemed by the earth governments to be non-partisan enough , non threatening in form , and intelligent and gracious to verbalize welcome and peace for all the world 's countries . <newline> <newline> Plus , if things went sour , he was more expendible than a political head . <newline> <newline> It took a full 8 hours for the silvery ship to descend from the lip of our atmosphere to the awaiting grass , and many speculated the slowness itself to be a communication of good will ; not too quick to raise alarm , and making it easy to predict the landing zone and arrange military protection to the site . <newline> <newline> Like the point of an arrow , the ancient astronaught , curious and grateful for the opportunity to serve , flanked by military , science , government and news , walked slowly toward the now opening doorway and descending ramp of the craft . <newline> <newline> The creature that emerged was not human , not animal , not insect nor ethereal . None of the creative material that humankind crafted for entertainment had caught the essence of this entity . That it was to be identified as female , all knew at once , though none could afterwards say why . <newline> <newline> She descended , the old astronaught met her midway , his words eloquent , rehearsed , and broadcast to a listening world , `` Peace . On behalf of mankind , welcome to planet earth . '' <newline> <newline> The world held its breath . <newline> <newline> Her voice was electric , feminine , a whisper , a song . She could have said a thousand different things to the people of earth , to the countries , to the military , governments , or scientists to astound , dismay , gladden or frighten ... <newline> <newline> Only , she said she loved him . <newline> <newline> And said nothing more . <newline> <newline> He bowed low and when he rose , he 'd shed his earthskin , revealing his true nature , his alien form . <newline> <newline> They walked up the ramp , reconciled and entwined , and flew away .

7,"She ran her fingers through her hair in exasperation and let out a rattled sigh . Some ad for a used car dealership played on the radio over the persistent hum of the idling engine and the hot air blasting through the vents . <newline> <newline> She suffered this misery to postpone the next . <newline> <newline> `` He said he would n't fucking be here '' she muttered nervously to herself as she gazed three houses down the street and saw the light filtering through the bay windows of his house . The digital clock in her car glowed 1:47 AM . She was exhausted and just wanted to get this over with sparing either of them any further confrontation , at least until things had cooled down . But it looked like he was n't going to make this any easier . Goddammit Peter . <newline> <newline> At first she had been captivated by his contradictions . He had a relaxed and glib way about him that was only betrayed by the intensity in his eyes . It was n't long after she met him and ventured deeper into his world that she became enamored with the purity of his pain and the sensitivity with which he experienced things . For every dark and cynical thing about him , there was a shadow of sincerity and deeper warmth . It was new , exciting . She had been his first real thing and it was intoxicating for the both of them . Well , for a time anyway . But feelings of dissatisfaction with him and with herself seeped into her mind as they always had . So did they too for Peter , she knew , but he wasn ’ t willing to acknowledge them . His intensity had proved too much for her to handle when she ended thing . <newline> <newline> She turned the key in the ignition , killing the engine and abruptly cutting off the chorus to some bland pop song she had been letting drown out the silence and slung the empty duffle bag over her shoulder . She took a deep breath , as if to inspire some courage into herself before making her way into the frigid winter night . <newline> <newline> Her knocks were greeted with no response , so she hesitantly slid her own key into the deadbolt , taking a moment before opening the door . <newline> <newline> `` Peter ? '' She called out , apprehension betraying her calm . No response . She felt uneasy . She made her way to the kitchen , where the light originated when she froze . Fluorescent light glinted off the puddle trailing from the linoleum kitchen tile before soaking into the stripped wood floor at the threshold . She felt the blood drain from her face as fear coiled its way tight from the base of her spine to her skull . “ P-Peter ? ” Her voice felt weak and small . <newline> <newline> She forced herself to follow the trail of burnt crimson as she called out hopelessly again , forcing herself to pass the threshold . What had he done ? Oh Christ , what had he done ? Rounding the corner , she felt as if someone had swung a sledgehammer into her stomach . The blood streaked down the outside rim of pale porcelain sink , haloing red over his slumped over body . His half lidded eyes , once piercing and brilliant were now dull , his spirit having long since decayed from them . <newline> <newline> The knife rest limply in his hand having fulfilled its purpose , as shallow and deep streaks and hash marks in his pale skin seemed to angrily outline each and every one of the justifications for his deed . She fell to her knees at his body , allowing the pool of blood surrounding him to stain her . She slowly reached out and pressed her hand to the cool skin of throat to feel for the pulse of life within him . Nothing . She hoped . But she knew . She tried to scream or cry or wail , but her voiced her been snatched away . She knew he was in a bad way but how was she supposed to know it was like this ? Nine fucking months . How could only nine fucking months together drive someone to do this ? It was n't her fault . She tried talking to him . She wanted things to be okay between them . She cared dearly about him and wanted them to be close . Jesus Christ . He 's gone forever . She noticed the ripped page spackled with blood clutched in his hand . It was from Hamlet . She made out a line that had been circled and scribbled until that part of the paper was mostly worn down : <newline> <newline> “ Doubt thou the stars are fire ; <newline> Doubt that the sun doth move ; <newline> Doubt truth to be a liar ; <newline> But never doubt I love. ” <newline> <newline> As she sat there , she felt an icy wave crest over herself and pull her under . What a waste . But what had she done ? What had she done ? <newline> She only said she loved him . <newline>

7,"*clack* *clack* *clack* <newline> <newline> His footsteps clapped roughly against the hard floor tiles . He paced back and forth anxiously , knowing what he had to do . He swallowed dryly . He knew he could do better than her , that someone out there would appreciate him for who he was . She 'd been abusive before , A slap here , a shove there . In the bedroom ... nausea redirected his thoughts away from there . One Valentine 's day he had been preparing them a dinner when she came in . The hot oil was just what she needed to relieve her frustration . <newline> <newline> The facial scarring did n't leave him much in the way of looks , but they did n't hurt as much as much as the wounds she 'd left on his soul every day since he 'd moved in with her . Those would last forever . <newline> <newline> And so he paced in his room for what seemed like forever , working up the courage to confront her , to tell her it was over for good . He had to do it now , he WOULD do it now . When she walked in the door , he was ready . Screaming his frustrations , he laid into her with as much force as he could muster . <newline> <newline> For once , she seemed to be listening intently , mouth agape in wonder at his sudden boldness . He felt a glimmer of hope , that he might actually walk out the door this time . She 'd cry despondently , and he 'd waltz out that door and meet someone new . Someone who would look past the scars , and see him for the gentle man he was . <newline> <newline> With a final snarl of hatred , he felt himself lighter than he 'd been in years . He pivoted on his heel and headed for the door . That 's when he heard her chuckle . <newline> <newline> `` You 're leaving *me* ? You ? And where will you go ? Who is going to take in a little bitch like you ? '' <newline> <newline> He felt the sting of her words as he slowly turned back to her and did his best to keep a triumphant face on . `` There will be other women , and they 'll look deep inside - '' <newline> <newline> She burst into hysterical laughter at this point . He felt his face warm , adopting the pigment only embarrassment and anger can give . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , they 're gon na look deep inside , and what ? Fall in love with the pussified manchild I 've dealt with ? You 're helpless . You were nothing when you first left , you were nothing when you came crawling back and even after five years you 're still nothing . You waste of skin . '' <newline> <newline> She walked herself to the kitchen to pour herself a glass of wine casually , not the slightest hint of worry or remorse apparent in her demeanor . <newline> <newline> `` Maybe they 'd be satisfied with you if you were any good in the sack . Hell , if you were still the pretty boy you were , maybe they 'd put up with your sorry ass . Of course , that 's not exactly gon na be happening for you now . '' <newline> <newline> He reached for the right side of his face instinctively , hoping to cover his blemish and salvage whatever was left of his will to take that final step outside . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , what 's wrong ? The door 's right there , so go . Go on , like your father . Walk on out the door . '' <newline> <newline> She snickered , her face so genuinely amused that it made him sick to his stomach . He knew it was juvenile , it was cruel . She had done this his whole life , and he knew her manipulation was all just a ploy to keep her little whipping dog around . He took that final step then , but away from the life he could have had . The gentle thud of the door carried more weight than any sound had a right to have . <newline> <newline> *clack* <newline> <newline> The familiar sound of his shoes hitting the hard tile echoed in the front room . His cheeks shimmered in the low light , and his chest heaved irregularly as he quietly sobbed , just a little boy again . <newline> <newline> She sipped from her glass and his heart sank before his mother uttered the words he 'd heard so many time , the words he knew to be true . <newline> <newline> She said only she loved him . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> <newline> Alright guys , absolutely the first time I 've written something here . Actually , it 's my first time working with a writing prompt at all . Hell , it 's pretty much my first time doing ANY creative writing . <newline> <newline> It 's my 21st b-day today , and I 've had a bit more brandy than I care to admit . But I figured hey , why not give it a quick go . So please forgive me if it 's pretty shit .

7,"`` Okay , '' said Rich , `` What do you think ? '' He nodded his head sagely in the blond woman 's direction . <newline> <newline> `` Why are you including me in this ? '' Sandy rolled her eyes . `` I *don't* want to be included in this ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Sandy , you 're a woman . You , uh , '' Mike stopped in an attempt to phrase it properly , `` you know how women , like , think . Or something . '' Sandy 's eye-rolling intensified . <newline> <newline> `` Ignore him , Sands . Just say , *as a human* , '' he looked at Mike reproachfully and continued , `` is the second date too early to break out the 'L ' word ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You mean 'lesbians ' ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Sandy . '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay ! Alright ! I do n't know , it seems weird , but maybe it was a slip of the tongue ? '' <newline> <newline> Rich tore open the bag of popcorn and started pouring it into a bowl . He looked over to Mike , quizzically reminiscing into the ether . `` What do you think ? What was the context of what she said ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh ... '' Mike fought hard for his memories . `` It was after the salad , but before the entree came out . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's helpful . '' Sandy grabbed a handful of popcorn as Rich plopped down on the couch beside her . <newline> <newline> `` Okay , so she ... she said something like 'You make such cute expressions when you do n't like what you 're eating . I love you . ' '' <newline> <newline> Sandy stared . `` Just like that ? You have a funny face , I love you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well no ! Her tone , it like , it went up in pitch , '' Mike sputtered , trying to recollect , `` Like she was talking about a cat or something . '' <newline> <newline> `` So maybe she loves you , but does n't , like , *love* love you . '' <newline> <newline> `` What the hell does that mean ? '' Rich stared at her . `` She does n't *love* love him ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , like , she loves him , like she loves her favorite TV show , or she loves pad thai , or something like that , but she does n't *love* love him like she wants to be with him forever . '' <newline> <newline> Mike briefly considered this , took a scoop of popcorn , and replied , `` That 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . Why would you say that on the second date unless you want to freak someone out ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Maybe , '' Rich looked at him , then narrowed his eyes in an attempt to look serious , `` But how do you feel about her ? Do you *love* love her ? '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? ! '' Mike spat out half-masticated kernels . <newline> <newline> `` I mean , maybe she does already *love* love you , you know ? '' Rich wiped a few bits off his shirt . `` Maybe she 's certain already , you have such charm . '' <newline> <newline> Sandy got up and walked behind the chair Mike sat in , `` How *do* you feel about her ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , she 's really cute , and very sweet , and has a ton of interesting things to talk about . She seems really caring , '' Mike sighed briefly , `` And when she talks she pushes her hair back , but it immediately bounces back to where it was , but she talks and continues on like she does n't notice . She 's in med school , so I know she 's really smart , and I can tell she 's gon na be really successful . And she *does* have the most beautiful laugh I 've ever heard in my life . Like , I 've never even noticed the way a person laughs before , but I hear hers in my head and it makes me smile , like , just at the memory . '' <newline> <newline> `` Dude ! '' Rich laughed , spilling the popcorn into the creases of the couch . `` I think you *love* love her ! '' <newline> <newline> Mike looked up at Sandy , who sympathetically placed her hand on his shoulder . `` It does seem like that , Michael . '' She smiled , and he looked down , smiling as well . <newline> <newline> `` I guess you 're right . I do . I do *love* love her . '' Mike stood up , `` And you know what ? I think she *love* loves me ! '' Sandy and Rich shared a look and chuckled while Mike grabbed his coat off the rack . <newline> <newline> `` Dude , where are you going ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Rachel gets out of class in fifteen minutes . I 'm gon na go down to campus and see her- I wan na hear her laugh . I wan na hear the laugh of the girl I *love* love ! '' <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> Six hours later , Rich arrived back at the apartment to find a trail of empty beer bottles , half-full handle of some off-brand bottom-shelf whiskey , and a very sick Mike leaning over their porcelain god while Sandy sat on the edge of the tub and gently rubbed his back . Rich gave the wretched form a once over and shot a silent , inquisitive look to his caretaker . <newline> <newline> Sandy sighed . `` She said she only loved him . '' <newline> <newline>

7,"When it came down to divying up the final count of the man , separating and organizing the matter of his life , there were 3 people in charge . Three people who did n't know him very well , but not for lack of trying or circumstance . One was his daughter , another his wife and the third his mother.They did n't know him because , as it turned out , he wasnt a person who could be known . Even sorting through his house , where he alone had ended up living , gave no hints as to who the man was . <newline> <newline> It was n't that the place was sparse or unfeeling . It contained all one would normally expect in a perfectly normal house : a bed , a desk , lamps , tables , chairs and decoration . And taken individually you could say that this piece spoke to his love of this or that style . But now the house seemed so varied as to make a gruel of his preferences . There was nothing //diffinitive// about it anymore . His taste in a lamp , if such a thing decries a man , could be said to lend him a frivoulous air . But his bedroom and kitchen painted him as the industrial sort . His bathroom as funny and playful . And on , and on , until the three women felt the strings of sanity losening at the edges whenever they tried to imagine just who they had failed to know so completely . <newline> <newline> If the circumstances around his death had been different so would their predicament . They would have simply ripped through the belongings , divying them up as they thought appropriate . Remembering little moments that each item called forth : when they had bought this thing on that warm Sunday afternoon ; laughing at the time they almost broke this or that thing ; how he had thrown that cat into the snow after it pissed on this pillow ( only to go trudging out in search of it an hour later ) . The dinners , the late night cuddles on the couch , how he 'd lock himself away in this office for hours , coming out in a sweating panick , hair twisted into off ends , reaking of stale cigarette smoke and wine . <newline> <newline> Even though they had grown apart over the years , they had always held an idea of him in their head . One without contest , or much varieation or intricacy . They held this notion right up until the moment he was found sitting in his old office , shorter by 6 inches , his `` head '' an open sore above his lower jaw . Right up until the letter , mirculously void of any gore , was opened and read . <newline> <newline> `` There is only one thing left to do for me here , if ever a thing was to be done . And it is not a nice thing . It is , in fact , quiet cruel . But as far as things go it is possibly the only thing I have done for many , many years . <newline> <newline> What you had seen as a man ; walking , talking and motioning at love , was actually a corpse . A living , breathing , rotting vessel . Devoid of light and life , yet kept dancing by the unseen strings of society . Propt up on notions of what 's proper and `` good '' for a man to do . And while I do n't directly prescribe to `` goodness '' , it has still somehow kept this body tethered here . Maybe for some small ember of hope that life would reveal meaning at some point , but probably because I could n't care one way or the other . Death seemed as oblivous as life , and I simply felt that neither circumstance would make much difference to my actual being . So why not ere on the side of assumed correctness ? Why not give breathing the benefit of the doubt ? <newline> <newline> Yet there I sit . Most likely covered in my own brain matter , with you likely covered in shock . Your every notion of mortality challenged . And I must say I envy you . You who were able to buy the ticket and take the ride . To hold the dueling opinion that life is both ridiculous and worthwhile ... Or maybe not . Maybe you are just wilfully ignorant . Maybe you 've have blinded yourself long ago . Maybe you never opened your eyes . <newline> <newline> I did once . And only once . And that was enough to shut them again for good . <newline> <newline> As a boy I 'd met a girl . And as boys do I fell into what they call love . And I had thought , for one burning year , that this was what life was for : finding just one other thing that could make the thing you were more sensical . Something that reached between the physical layers of `` self '' to reveal a true nature of being . One where we were n't so alone . One where a person was not just a person , but a thing alive and connected . I felt seen . And connected . And while I first thought this sentiment mythical , and above my understanding , and therefor `` right '' in the way your parents are right when you 're a little kid , it turned out I had confused the notion entirely . It wasnt the sentiment that made up the feeling . It was simply feelings strung together to make sentiment . And that sentiment was expressed in a few simple words that I had cherrished saying and hearing until the eventual realization that sounds falling from a mouth do n't equate to some mystical reasurring function . They do n't really equate to anything but the filling up of a balloon . Because while I have only ever 'loved ' her , for the brief moment of my existence where such a thing was possible , she said she loved only him '' . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

7,"“ You , you love me ? ” Daniel questioned incredulously . His lips parted slowly in astonishment , releasing a thin rivulet of drool . His dense eyebrows raised into perfect semi-circles as a wave of energy sprang up from his heart . <newline> <newline> “ Yippee ! ” he screamed as he bounced around his padded cell like the deranged hunchback he was . Izzie smiled evilly as she watched him celebrate like a toddler . <newline> <newline> “ But only because you love me , Daniel . I can ’ t love you if you don ’ t love me , sweetie , ” Izzie condescended . <newline> <newline> “ Of course , I love you , Izzie . I love you , I love you , iloveyou , iloveyou , ilveoyu. ” <newline> <newline> “ Stop ! ” she commanded , losing her patience . “ I mean , ” Izzie coughed , “ please contain your joy , my dear . I know you say you love me , but… ” Daniel froze as if immediately paralyzed . He looked catatonic for a solid moment then shouted as if he had been stabbed . <newline> <newline> “ Oh , but what ! ” he cried , slamming into the door separating them . “ What , what , what , my love . I love , love , love you ! ” Daniel reached his fingers through the crisscrossed metal bars between their faces . Izzie leaned forward and let him stroke her soft cheek with his rough fingers , before backing up and speaking again . <newline> <newline> “ Oh , you will say it a hundred times and hurt me with every utterance . If you loved me you wouldn ’ t be here , separated from me. ” Izzie ran her fingers along the metal between them . “ Do not tell me you love me if you do not have the courage to be with me , ” she added , turning her face from Daniel with a humph . <newline> <newline> “ But they will not let me leave , my love , they keep me lock , lock , locked up in here . Please , please , tell me you love me . Pat my head , ” Daniel pleaded , throwing his head against the metal bars so she could touch his slimy shaved scalp . <newline> <newline> “ My god , Daniel , you ’ ve bent the bars ! ” Izzie exclaimed with false surprise . “ Look at you , my fine young man . You ’ ve grown up so big and so strong . I know you ’ re lying now . You could break out of here on your own . '' <newline> <newline> “ What ? No ! I can ’ t . I can ’ t , ” Daniel cried on the edge of hysterical tears . Izzie checked her sides and noticed that no nurses or attendants were around . <newline> <newline> “ Yes you can , baby . Hit the bars one more time . See , here , ” she added pointing to specific bar , “ you bent it last time without even trying . Do it again , harder this time. ” Before Izzie could finish talking , Daniel slammed his head into the bars between them once again with a wicked crash . As he reared his head back , blood flung into the air ; a spot landed on Izzie ’ s cheek like a morbid beauty spot . <newline> <newline> “ Again , my love ! ” Izzie cried , and again Daniel viciously head butted the bars separating them . <newline> <newline> “ Tear them down , tear them down , ” Izzie started chanting as Daniel backed away from the door , looking as if he were losing consciousness . Blood flowed openly from multiple bone gilded holes in his forehead . <newline> <newline> “ Once more , my love , get a running start this time . You can do it . Take the door off its very hinges ! ” <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s not working momma , I feel sick…oh , momma , it hurts. ” <newline> <newline> “ Come here , baby , come to momma , ” she coaxed on . “ Come here and I will love you. ” <newline> <newline> Daniel looked around for a second before locking onto the door . He dropped to all fours like a track runner then let out a barbaric cry as he charged the door . His temple met the door first , twisting his head violently as his body followed . A crack erupted into the air as his cheek bone collapsed . Blood spat through the grated partition and Daniel ’ s body went slack . His weight held him against the door for a moment , but , slowly , gravity pulled his body down and smacked his head into the ground once more . Izzie let out a gasp and smiled like a child on Christmas . Looking down the hall , she spotted nurses coming at her from either side . She lowered her head then banged against Daniel ’ s door with her own first . <newline> <newline> “ Stop , stop , for the love of God , my son , stop ! ” she yelled until the nurses arrived . <newline> <newline> “ What ’ s going on , ma ’ am ? ” one nurse asked . <newline> <newline> “ My son , I think he ’ s killed himself ! ” Izzie screamed back . The nurse opened the door and blood leaked out . She peered into the room and shrieked . <newline> <newline> “ My lord , in front of his own mother ? What sick fantasy was he enacting ? Oh God , his face . What on earth did you say to him , ma ’ am ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I only said I loved him , ” Izzie replied as she pinched herself to tears . `` I only said I loved him ! '' <newline> <newline> The other nurse looked into the cell and covered her mouth as if she would retch . “ There ’ s no understanding these people , crazies , ” she said “ She only said she loved him , she only said she loved him and , gosh . The other nurse went into the room and checked Daniel ’ s pulse . <newline> <newline> “ He ’ s dead , ” she announced . <newline> <newline> “ She only said she loved him . ”

7,"`` Martha made his life a living hell . '' Sarah took another drag from her cigarette then contemplated it while pushing the smoke out from the corner of her mouth . `` That bitch would have him up four times a night walking around that old-ass house of theirs looking for burglars or some shit . Did n't matter what time of year it was , neither . '' Sarah set her wrist down on the table near the ashtray and looked back at the officer across from her . `` I remember once , his dumbass tried calling me in the middle of the night . '' <newline> <newline> `` What did the two of you talk about ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Talk ! '' Sarah snorted , glanced away , then turned back to the officer , pointing at him with the fingers holding the cigarette . `` I told that mother-fucker to go back to bed because I sure as shit was n't going to chit-chat with him when I had an eight AM shift the next morning . '' <newline> <newline> `` Did he say anything ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah he tried . Something about how cold it was out there . I was like 'No shit , dumbass ! ' '' <newline> <newline> `` Was it common for your brother-in-law to call you in the middle of the night ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I would n't say common . '' She paused and looked around the room for a moment . `` No , he did n't call me much . Definitely not that time of night . '' After another drag on the cigarette she continued , `` I think he sorta called me when he just could n't handle Martha anymore . Maybe he figured since I grew up with her I would understand a little better . '' Sarah looked back at the officer and narrowed her eyes . `` The truth is , I never wanted to deal with her shit again after leaving home . So part of me pities that man . But I still was n't about to sit around shootin the breeze with him at four in the morning . '' <newline> <newline> `` Do you remember him saying anything else ? Anything out of the ordinary ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh I do n't know . I mean they were both always carrying on about that house . Bullshit about it being haunted or whatever . I guess that 's why she would send him out there at night ; heard something rustling in the bushes or what have you . Mostly , it was Martha complaining ; I always had the impression that David was just putting up with her , as usual . But , '' Sarah paused here , turning the cigarette around in her hand for a moment , before setting it back to her lips and taking another drag . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , Mrs . Helmer ? '' Sarah turned her head back and looked at the officer , the cigarette momentarily forgotten . <newline> <newline> `` Well I guess he sounded scared that night . Mind , I was barely awake and none too happy about it . But he sounded worried…not just pissed off like me . Like something was eating at him . '' She snorted again . `` Something other than my sister , for once . '' <newline> <newline> `` Can you tell me anything else about what he said . Anything about what might have been frightening him ? '' <newline> <newline> Sarah sighed , `` Like I told you , I don ’ t really remember the P 's and Q 's of our talk . It was cold , Martha had him walking around the house again , something about the sky looking funny that time of night . I do n't know . Why do n't you ask my sister ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Mrs. Samuels is uh , not being very cooperative at the moment . '' The officer looked away before continuing , somewhat hastily , `` and it 's important to try and find out what happened that night from more than one point of view . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well my point of view is that this is none of my damned business , anyway . '' Sarah turned back to the wall of the small office and resumed smoking her cigarette . <newline> <newline> `` Mrs. Helmer , you are aware we found a butcher knife in the kitchen covered in Mr. Samuels blood . Along with your sister 's fingerprints . '' Sarah turned slowly back to the officer , drawing the cigarette away from her mouth . <newline> <newline> `` Well I was n't aware , but now I am ; thank you for that visual , '' she said , evenly . <newline> <newline> `` Do you feel that Mrs. Samuels had any reason to harm your brother-in-law ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You mean like kill him , right ? I sure hope not . She 'd be back to hollering at me every other hour without David around . Do n't get me wrong , Martha has a temper and she would n't tolerate any kind of stepping out or any of that nonsense . But David was n't dumb enough to do anything like that . No , I ca n't think she woulda gone after him for any reason I can think of . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you did mention that your sister has a temper . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh yeah , get her mad enough she was liable to do anything . Terrible to say that about my own sister , but I remember her kicking that damned dog so much it started walking with a limp . I do n't mean once or twice , neither . That dog would come sniffing around and she would kick it like it was her job . '' Sarah frowned and put the cigarette out forcefully the ashtray before muttering , almost to herself , `` I loved that damned dog . '' After another deep sigh , she looked back at the officer , her worn face set . `` Get her mad enough , I guess she could even kill a man . Only , '' Sarah trailed off , looking at the back of her left hand , resting on the table . She pursed her lips and her brow furrowed . <newline> <newline> `` Only what , Mrs . Helmer ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Only , '' she said , `` she loved him . ''

7,"( Nosleep styled . Trigger warnings ! ! ! ) <newline> <newline> <newline> In the bright shine of summer , Alex was beautiful . The way his hair seemed to glisten with strands of bronze in just the right light . That little sparkle in his eyes that resembled flecks of gold . His skin , like caramel , from having worked in the yards of neighbors . Jenna watched him from her window as he mowed her lawn . She could feel the attraction to him tugging her . It drove her mad when his girlfriend , Ashley , picked him up . <newline> <newline> <newline> Maybe , she thought , Alex just has n't noticed me yet . The 17 year old would dress in her skimpiest bathing suit and sunbathe on the back deck . Alas , her efforts to allure the 18 year old boy , went unnoticed . <newline> <newline> <newline> Jenna found herself dreaming of his touch , his voice , his love ... his life ... <newline> <newline> ______________ <newline> <newline> I had been mowing Jenna 's lawn for the past thirty minutes when I heard her call down to me from the deck . I sigh , wipe my brow , and look up to the rather desperate Jenna . <newline> <newline> `` Come to my party Saturday ? It 's my birthday ! '' She called out , waving a hot pink invitation . <newline> <newline> <newline> I try to be nice to her , especially considering the fact that she is in special needs classes and has little friends . I nod reluctantly and agree to come . I know I 've signed myself up for the most awkward event but whatever . She deserves friends . <newline> <newline> <newline> By the time Saturday rolled around , I had bought her a few books wrapped in pink wrapper . I was just wearing jeans and a t-shirt . No need to dress up . I stuck my phone in my back pocket and brushed my hair over with my fingers . I looked fine . I 'm not going all out for this . <newline> <newline> When I showed up , the driveway had one car , but there were lights everywhere . I collected myself and made my way to the door and rang the doorbell . She opened the door in a time so short that it seemed like she must 've been waiting on the other side of the door for me . She jumped a little and gave me a hug . <newline> <newline> Now let me just make a side note . I 've never been in Jennas house past the front door . The whole place smelled like Pinesol and Potpourri . Kinda resembled a gas station . I gave her the gift and heard a clicking sound as she shut the door . I turned around quickly . <newline> <newline> `` Jenna , did you lock the door ? '' I asked her . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` No . Silly , why would I lock the door ? See ? '' She pulled it open and closed before finally closing it . She ruffled my hair with her fingers before bounding past me . <newline> <newline> <newline> I began to feel a little uneasy . She looked at me and furrowed her brow . `` What 's wrong , Alex ? '' She asked me quietly . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Nothing , I just was thinking . Where is everyone ? '' I whispered . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Oh they 'll be here . '' She smiled at me . Her smile slowly faded as her eyes wondered my body . I felt immediately vulnerable and incredibly uncomfortable . I reached for my phone slowly to find my back pocket empty . <newline> <newline> <newline> I looked down at the floor and felt my stomach sink to the ground and my heart leap to my throat . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Jenna , where 's my phone ? '' As calmly as I could , I uttered each word . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` You do n't need it . We 're here . Together . Just us . No Ashley . No parents . No problem . '' She walked a few steps towards me . I took a few steps back . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` No party . '' I whispered . <newline> <newline> She winked at me . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` What are you doing ? '' I whispered as she pressed me against the wall . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` I love you . Only me Alex . Not her . Not Ashley . Me . I am the only one you should love . '' She nipped my ear lobe . <newline> <newline> <newline> I quickly pulled away and took off running . The front door knob was reversed . I was locked in . She grabbed my bicep and attempted to drag me down the hall . I pulled from her grasp once more and as I climbed to my feet , she hit me . <newline> <newline> <newline> I woke up handcuffed to a water heater in the basement . A single light hung above my head . It could barely illuminate a message scrawled in red paint on the wall opposite of me . <newline> <newline> <newline> The light swung , so I could only catch pieces of the message . Suddenly , my thoughts were interrupted by stomping . Jenna came thundering down the stairs with a baseball bat and a gun . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Read the message . '' She said calmly . She stood beside the red paint message . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't . '' I choked out behind tears . I knew I would die today . <newline> <newline> `` Read . The . Message . '' A little louder . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't see it . '' I sobbed . <newline> <newline> `` READ IT ! '' She screamed grabbing the light and pointing it at the wall . <newline> <newline> <newline> Both I could find the words to say it , the gun was pointed towards herself , and ... .I ca n't say the rest ... . it 's my fault . Its all my fault . I could 've prevented it . I could 've saved her . Maybe if I found the will to love her ... <newline> <newline> <newline> I guess it was for the best though ... a mind so chaotic and so distraught that she killed not only herself , but her parents as well . When I was found , two days later very dehydrated and very sick , they found the three bodies and the message scrawled in what I soon found out was blood . It said : `` She only loved him . ''

7,"He liked to be called Wade <newline> <newline> Little was known about the tall autistic youth , except he was kind and trusting to a fault . Like he lived in a world where nobody could hurt him . Someone left him there at a top of a line cancer research facility with an absurd amount of paper money in his wallet and a crumpled note on the inside that simply said , <newline> <newline> “ Please cure this boy. ” <newline> <newline> After some initial tests confirming his cancer and the extent of his autism , he was almost ignored . The tumor was located next to his amygdala , and would likely kill him if it continued to grow . Everyone was reluctant to test anything on him , who would be responsible ? How would they explain to corporate how they were able to pay for all of this extra testing ? <newline> <newline> <newline> The head nurse , a young lady named Laura began to befriend Wade . She had an autistic younger brother , and warmed up to Wade quickly . In her limited free time she took his hand and showed her the progress their facility was making . He talked to her about his life and his crippling headaches . She explained to Wade his grave situation on many occasions . He realized how similar his condition was to the rats that were given cancer in order to be tested on and how they died even with the advanced treatment the facility was researching . <newline> <newline> He began to bug other researchers with incessant questions about brain cancer , and what they could do to cure it . He was dismissed each way he turned until a cynical researcher agreed to try to help him . Roberts was the head researcher on the rats and they had a couple injections that were promising and almost ready for human tests . They had no human subjects and Roberts realized that Wade was the only chance they were going to get until their name was put back into a good light . <newline> <newline> Laura heard about these experiments a week after they began . She asked about Wade ’ s past on one of their talks , it was either something he didn ’ t want to talk about , or simply forgot . She was becoming disturbed by how tired Wade was . His eyes seemed too heavy to stay open , his speech slurred and drifted for no apparent reason , his legs seemed numb , and slowed them down when they went on their usual walks . She knew the tests were killing him faster than any disease could , and needed to confront Roberts . <newline> <newline> Roberts tried walking out of Wade ’ s room only to be confronted by Laura . <newline> She screamed at him , eyes like fire . <newline> <newline> “ What the hell do you think you ’ re doing ? Who the fuck are you reporting to , who would approve of your use of a human being as another fucking rat . You know this is wrong ! ” <newline> <newline> Wade watched in surprise as Roberts laughed emotionlessly in her face . <newline> <newline> “ Please , I don ’ t care what kind of crush you have on this kid , Laura . We need him . Hell , we need more of him if that last injection fails. ” <newline> <newline> Laura shifted her glance to Wade , tears running down her cheek . <newline> <newline> “ I can ’ t be a part of this institution anymore . I just… I love you . You don ’ t need this treatment , I never should ’ ve shown you around this place , I ’ m sorry , I ’ m sorry this place dehumanized you . I ’ ll get this damned place shut down. ” She turned to leave and looked at Roberts ’ s cynical smirk . “ I quit ” . <newline> <newline> She rushed down the hall without listening to any of Roberts ’ s orders . <newline> Wade stared out of the empty doorway , and closed his eyes as Roberts slammed it shut . His head struggled with these thoughts , his only friend was leaving forever . His life was going to be torn apart . His life in which nothing could hurt him was being ripped away . His last thoughts were of her , he passed out onto the floor as blood suddenly rushed to his head . <newline> <newline> The latest injection hit him hard . The tumor in his amygdala shrunk into almost nothing , and the empty area filled with blood . He woke up in life support after a random nurse found him within an inch of his life . Wade looked up at her emotionlessly . His tumor was coming back in force and the pressure against his amygdala filled him with a cold rage . Rage , in a man who lived in a world that couldn ’ t hurt him . <newline> <newline> The burning rage cleared his mind . He began to remember his past , a second child pushed off to the side due to his autism . Disappointment from everyone where he thought there should be love , and the eventual abandonment to a fucking research facility , like an animal . Connections started to turn on in his brain that weren ’ t there before . A greater understanding of everything he came into contact with throughout his entire life . He began to understand his abuse in this building . These revelations overshadowed any memory of a girl named Laura , he began to embody the hate that he believed was appropriate for a lifetime of neglect . <newline> <newline> The nurse left the room quickly after looking into unfeeling eyes . Wade sat up and carefully removed anything connected to him , alarms were set off at the main desk once the life support ceased to read his heart rate . He stood and ripped a sconce off of the wall , and tore apart the wires to the life support system with serrated glass . An electrical fire began to spread through his bed sheets , and wallpaper was peeling next to the bed . He threw what was left of the glass sconce blindly at whoever was walking down the hall towards him , and began walking away from a bloodcurdling scream . He needed to see Roberts . <newline> <newline> The alarm wasn ’ t loud enough to be heard in the research wing , and Roberts jumped backwards as his door flung open . Mice began to chatter around them as Wade approached . He lifted Roberts by the throat with one hand . <newline> <newline> “ Let the mice free. ” <newline> <newline> He threw Roberts against the wall , and after a shocked second , Roberts ran to the control panel and opened each cage for the experimental rats . They started scurrying onto the floor and found an open vent that lead outside . The researcher looked at Wade with eyes a mix of anger and fear . <newline> <newline> “ Do you know what you ’ ve done ? Years of research , all of this work for nothing ? You ’ re just another fucking lab rat , you wouldn ’ t understand any of what I ’ ve been doing , all the sacrifices I ’ ve been making since I ’ ve started working here . I MADE THIS PLACE WHAT IT IS ” <newline> <newline> Wade stared back for a solemn second before he began walking away , he slammed the door shut , breaking its lock so nobody but rats could leave the room . He looked at Roberts one more time through a small glass window in the door . <newline> <newline> “ I know ” <newline> <newline> He walked down the hall hearing crackling flames , alarms , and screams from the recovery wing . The fire quickly spread to engulf the area behind him as he made his way to Laura ’ s office . <newline> <newline> Wade sat in her chair . Nothing was packed up yet . He smiled . It was just like her to get so passionate about something , decide to leave and quit before thinking of any impact that would have on her life . He leaned back and looked around the room . It made every attempt to stay as sterile as a hospital , but it still had some of her in it . A Diploma from The University of Columbia for Nursing hung on the wall next to a picture of her family . A shelf of medical books leaned against the wall on his right , many were signed copies she showed him whenever they passed by her office . The desk was a cheap wood , and held a computer with a photo framed next to it . It was the only picture of him he had ever seen . In a garden , smiling at a world that could never hurt him . <newline> <newline> He heard the roar of flames outside of the office , closed his eyes , and went through his mind one last time . He couldn ’ t think of a single time anyone in his life showed any affection to him . He could only recall stares of disappointment and fearful curiosity . His world that couldn ’ t hurt him was bliss from ignorance . He never understood those stares until now . The stares that even came from his parents and siblings . Tears filled his eyes , tears of happiness through this final realization . <newline> <newline> <newline> Only she said she loved him <newline>

7,"<newline> -- - <newline> -- <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> ^^^^ ( **Story:1** ) ^^^^ ( **Prepare** ) <newline> *H*is sword was swaying back and forth from his hip concurrent with the dark bay 's cautious trot . As they emerged from the ravine they were greeted by the familiar voice of the forest ; birds flying from tree to tree , woodpeckers echoing from far away and old trees protesting against the wind with loud creaks . The treetops above him played with the sun 's rays , as the wind shook them , and he enjoyed the warm and cool of the sun and shadow . <newline> <newline> He took a moment to take it all in before he shifted his weight and jumped off the mare . She was anxious and her muscles tense . He reined her in the direction of the village and slapped her side , awkwardly commanding her to go back . The sound of the mare 's hooves grew weaker and softer until she was finally gone . <newline> <newline> A rustle behind him made him stiffen . With a hand on the hilt of his sword he turned . Dark , deep eyes greeted him and he stood there , frozen in awe . Mere feet from him stood a young deer . Its immaculate antlers twisted into many sharp points and stood in stark contrast to its eyes . It seemed like an eternity had passed when the deer finally turned and started hopping away through the thick undergrowth . His stomach turned as he thought of the antlers sinking into his belly and goring him . It 'd seem that even the beauty of nature could n't get his mind back in a state of peace . <newline> <newline> It had taken too long already . There was n't much time to prepare for what would come , so he decided it was time to come to terms with his demons . <newline> <newline> He kneeled down next to the brook , its water rushing from the ravine as if it too wished to escape . Scars , mis-colored skin and a mangled nose greeted him , warped in the rushing waters reflection . The wounds were old , at least most of them . There was a collection of fresh cuts and bruises from last night . He stuck his hands into the cold water and started to cleanse himself . It stung , but it helped clear his mind . <newline> <newline> He could never go back to the village , never again . He had been accustomed to a life of misery due to his frightening visage , but this time was n't like the others . From a young age he was told that a demon had jumped into his body , through his face , when he was born . It was said that he would have to carry the weight of the sins he and the demon brought upon the village , the first of which was taking the life of his mother . <newline> <newline> She died during childbirth and he had his nose to show for the justice of the villagers . <newline> <newline> No one looked at him twice , other than when they beat him to right their wrongs , or desired to make an acquaintance with him , no one but Master Juvin 's daughter Adelaide . <newline> <newline> He let himself fall onto his back in frustration . <newline> <newline> After listening to the forest for a while he pulled out a letter . It was addressed to him . Looking at it made him smile , if only for a short while . He unfolded the letter and started reading it again : `` To Jargoniew ... '' it said at the top , with Adelaide 's delicate handwriting . As he read through it he thought of how she had held him , how she had let her hands travel beneath his coat and to his chest . But her hand had n't rested on his diseased skin , but rather on his heart . Just like her eyes had look past his scars and into his eyes . <newline> <newline> Last night they had met for the last time . Master Juvin had passed away and everyone thought that it was the work of the demon . Jargoniew had promised Adelaide that he would run off to a faraway place and start a new life , that he would keep her in his heart like she would him in hers , and return if he ever could . They had kissed goodbye in the stables and made care not to be seen . Adelaide had stolen a sword for him and picked out her favorite mare for him to ride away on . <newline> <newline> Jargoniew had treasured every moment of happiness . It had been 17 long years of nothing but sadness and indifference , to suddenly be broken down by love . He could not imagine a more true love in this world , than what he felt when he was with her . <newline> <newline> He let himself heave for air and bring forth the tears . He did n't care if he looked weak . No one would write stories of him , he was no hero , in this moment he just wanted to feel . It felt good to cry . His heart felt lighter , even though he knew there was still one burden left for him to deal with . <newline> <newline> Jargoniew heard the echo of hooves again and turned , ready to shoo the mare again , so that she would go back to the village . but the hooves did n't come from the forest , they came from the ravine . As they came closer he heard that there were more than one , at least three , sets of hooves . <newline> <newline> The village 's sword master , Daniel , was riding along with two other guards . They had tracked him down . He wiped away his tears and quickly started to swallow the paper , standing up . `` Hey , what is this ? Give it here , freak . '' Daniel drew his sword and strode towards him . The other two guards , glancing at the sword at Jargoniew 's hip quickly dismounted and followed suit . Before they could do anything , Jargoniew had swallowed the letter , destroying any evidence that linked him to Adelaide . He could not bear to think what they would do to her if they found out . <newline> <newline> Jargoniew drew his sword . Daniel scoffed : `` live like a freak , die like a man ? '' his guards laughed , `` I did n't expect such bravery from a miserable demon like you '' . <newline> <newline> Jargoniew stood silently for a moment . <newline> <newline> He swung the sword around and moved the point towards himself , stabbing through his belly , dark red blood spurting out and mixing with the water in the brook . <newline> <newline> There was a thick silence . Jargoniew fell to his knees . Daniel moved closer , cautiously and whispered with disbelief : `` what are you doing , boy ? '' . He looked up and blinked `` I saw no reason to hurt y-you . I 'd achieve nothing but a vengeful kill , nothing but taking a life in spite . '' Jargoniew felt dark dots dancing for his eyes as he stuttered , `` you came to kill me , to cleanse your village of my curses . I have done you a favor . '' <newline> <newline> `` How am I to trust you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You are to trust me by the blood running red . You can see that I am human and like a human I will die . I will make a bond , taking the demon with me . But only if you do me a favor . '' <newline> <newline> Daniel looked at his men , uncertain . `` Speak , '' he said finally . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't want them to know that I took my own life . Tell them that you scared me off , made me run like the coward I am . I 've suffered enough , I wish to be able to die , knowing that I will not be shamed for taking my life . '' <newline> <newline> `` A fair enough proposition , Jargoniew . Suicide might be against our religion , but these are not normal circumstances . I will grant you peace in the afterlife , if you in turn promise that the demon grants us peace . '' <newline> <newline> Jargoniew nodded , he could n't find the strength to speak . <newline> <newline> Soon he could n't find the strength to breathe . <newline> <newline> Daniel and his men made sure that the job was done . One of Daniel 's guards cut Jargoniew 's belly up and found the pieces of paper . `` Give me that , '' Daniel said sternly . <newline> <newline> Most of the letter was unintelligible and had been spoiled by the blood or torn by Jargoniew 's sword . All but a corner piece . <newline> <newline> `` ... I love you . '' it said . Daniel scoffed , `` it seems that he had a little lovebird . '' <newline> <newline> `` Really , who ? `` , the guard who had split Jargoniew 's belly asked with disbelief . <newline> <newline> `` I have n't the slightest clue , but I 'm sure that she and only she said she loved him .

7,"Edit : Yeah , its long . But it 's worth it . <newline> <newline> <newline> Life was pain . That had been made clear to him , from the first days he could recall . Life was to be endured . <newline> <newline> He woke each day , muscles already tense with trepidation . Despite whatever actions he took , his tormentor sought him out . A large man , much bigger than he was . This man yelled at him , grabbed at him , and dragged him around . He was thrown in the center of the scary open place , and there he would cower . All he felt here was aggression , all he heard was yelling , snarling , the cheering of coarse men . And when he shrunk back in fear , the angry man would strike him . He knew he was disappointing the angry man , and he wanted to appease the angry man ... but he just could n't seem to summon up the aggression that seemed to be expected of him . Finally one terrifying day , the angry man caught up a burning stick , and thrust it into his face . The flame seared the sight from his eye , engulfed the world , and all his sensitive nose could smell was his own crackling flesh , and the stink of burning fur . <newline> <newline> When he came to , he was in an alley . He was cold , and his face hurt . Life likely would have expired there , a sad ending in confusion and pain , whimpering in the dirt . It would n't be the first end the angry man had wrought . However , he was one of the lucky few . It was a blur of confusing scents , and gentle hands , smeared together in the pain of the burn and the pus of his twisted lip . There was an odd sensation of being carried , and the small prick of a needle in his forearm ... and then a burning cold stole into his veins . The world receded . Mercifully . <newline> <newline> It was a time before he could order his thoughts again . Compassionate people came and went , usually women with soft voices and gentle hands . They tried to not cause pain , but pulling the bandages and wound dressings off hurt . Burns hurt . He whimpered , trying to turn his face away . When the women simply stroked his shoulder , he would lick their hands , so grateful not to be hurting , not to be fighting . <newline> <newline> People came . People went . His skin knit , his burns scarred over , but his fur did n't grow back over the burn . The world was diminished , half of what it used to be . One side , he could still see . But the other ? A dimness where once there had been sight . People would stop in front of his room , peering thru the glass . Pity , disgust , fear ... he saw all these expressions . His ragged stump of a tail softly tapped the concrete floor of the shelter room . No one wanted to adopt a one-eyed pitbull with a twisted snarl of a half-burned muzzle . <newline> <newline> He waited . As only a dog can , with no concept of time . There was only now . There was only this place . <newline> He waited . <newline> <newline> The soft jingle of a door . He came to his feet in a rush . Was it the angry man ? ! He cowered . Nothing happened . The rich scent of human filled his nose . Female human ? Well , they were usually nice . He looked sidelong at her , a quick glance , trying to judge her intent . She waited , not trying to capture his eyes with hers . <newline> <newline> He came to her , as he must . His heart cried out to please , to learn what this human wanted , to do his best to appease her . She knelt , and gently rubbed the remains of his ear , chopped off with scant regard for his wellbeing when he was a puppy . Fighting dogs do n't need soft ears after all , do n't need to perk them to catch the soft command of a gentle master , do n't need them to protect their eardrums from dirt and flies . But she rubbed his ear , right in that soft place just behind . He closed his one remaining eye , leaning into her . <newline> <newline> The rest was just paperwork . <newline> <newline> He learned what this new master wanted . He learned about sitting when told , about coming when called , about not jumping on the counter . He learned about soft tasty treats , about warm beds to lie on , about the holy of holies : being invited on the couch to snuggle up to his master , to the endless soothing feeling of her hand on his pelt . She rubbed lotion into his scars , and the skin grew softer . His snarl would never disappear , but it did lessen , and he was able to drink from his water bowl with a little less mess . She did n't care when he could n't quite manage it , when he slopped water . She had a mat for his bowl . He had his own food dish . <newline> <newline> He followed her everywhere . They went for walks . He was scared of strange men , but she was his strength , and her calm reassurance helped him not to lunge and snarl and cower and flee . He went with her to friend 's houses , and once they knew him , they loved him as well . <newline> <newline> They went to a backyard party . There were other dogs . He knew the other dogs , knew they lived here , and he leaped out of the car when she opened the door , racing to the backyard . It was time to play ! But when he ran around the side of the house , a deamon crouched in the backyard . Snapping and roaring , it danced in the middle of the people , reaching out to seize them . He slid to a halt , bewildered . He shook , and urine spattered the grass below him . <newline> <newline> He had never seen a firepit before . <newline> <newline> She was there , she wrapped him in her arms , turned him away from the fire . He trembled , shamed . She spoke to her friends , and pulled him away . He crouched in the back of the car , knowing he had done something wrong , failed . She turned in the front seat , looking at him . <newline> <newline> `` It 's ok , I still love you . '' He did n't really know what the words meant , of course . But she said them often to him , and he was reassured . He crawled towards her , licking her hand . She laughed , and rubbed his head . All was forgiven . There were no more firepits . <newline> <newline> Sometimes they played Drag . It was a silly game , but he loved it . It started when she went sledding at a hill . He was so excited , he grabbed the rope for the sled in his jaws , and pulled it around in a jagged circle . She laughed , delighted at his strength . He wriggled his entire back end , not just his tail . He lived to please her . Eventually , he would grab her pantleg , usually while she was shovelling the sidewalk . She would sit down , and he would tug and pull , growing in mock ferocity . She would laugh , as he dragged her around in the snow . He loved the snow . Soft and puffy , it would spring back when he leaped into it . She would shovel big clumps at him , and he would jump , mouth open . Best of all , it was cold , and never burned with heat . <newline> <newline> Time passed . One night , he woke from his bed . There was a smell . A very bad smell . He lunged to his feet . There was a sound . A crackling , not roaring , not yet . Just chuckling to itself , preparing to destroy . Acrid smoke stung his sensitive nose , made his one eye water . He cowered , stump of a tail tucked . Shivering wracked his body . <newline> <newline> He fled . Across the room , down the hallway , to the kitchen . One leap onto the kitchen table , and the window was before him . The smoke was worse up here . He barrelled into the window , heavy shoulders breaking the old glass . Fresh air ! With a muffled roar , the fire sucked in the oxygen flowing in thru the broken window . He did n't hear , he ran . <newline> <newline> Neighbours were there , people he knew a little bit . He cowered in the back yard , the people milled about . Where was she ? Why was n't she here ? One neighbour rushed to the back door , using the spare key . The door smashed open , air rushing in . The neighbour shrunk back . The flames were beginning to catch , the fire crawled along the drapes , lit the hallway in hellish light . <newline> <newline> The neighbours yelling . Dismay in their voices . Sorrow . He cowered in the snow . Though his ears were torn , he still heard perfectly fine . He heard her then . Coughing . Crying out . He heard her falling . His big body wracked with fear , his powerful muscles quivering in puppyhood horror . He could just see the pantleg of her pajamas , as he peered from his height , well under the smoke she had choked in . He could ... . he could ... . he knew he could drag her , even over the hallway floor . But the curtains were ablaze , and the walls were burning . The fire would burn his sides . The curtains were falling in melting ropes . He would be burned . And badly . The demon was everywhere , and it would devour all he held dear . He could n't face it . Not even for her . <newline> <newline> Only ... . She had said she loved him . <newline> <newline> Epilouge : <newline> <newline> **The Daily Times** <newline> <newline> ... . Firefighters were able to control the blaze , saving the houses next to the residence . One woman is recovering in hospital . There were no other people in the house , only the body of a dog that was found in the backyard . <newline> <newline>

7,"`` Ugh , I 'm gon na be sick . I think-I think this is what butterflies feels like . '' Max groaned . Aaron sat in the driver seat of the car and shifted away . <newline> `` If you 're gon na be sick , please do it out the window . I just got this car cleaned . '' Aaron pleaded . <newline> `` Ca n't we just come back later ? It look 's like he 's home . '' Max swallowed down his fear . <newline> `` That 's the point Max . Listen , you brought me as back up , and here I am backing you up . But you better fucking do this now . '' Aaron looked hard at Max , who finally stopped shaking . Max nodded and opened the door . <newline> `` Wish me luck . '' He said as he walked to the door . A man answered . `` Uh , Hello Mr . Robinson . '' <newline> ___ <newline> Some time later <newline> ___ <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know man , I 'm getting a real bad case of the butterflies . '' Max said to Aaron . Aaron spruced up his coat and looked to his friend . `` You ca n't just call this off now , everythings in place . '' <newline> Max took a deep breath , held it and released with , and with it his nerves . They left the bathroom and returned to the table where Erica sat , and his nerves came back . <newline> `` What was that about ? '' Erica asked with a sly smirk . <newline> `` Oh , you know , Max has trouble shaking it dry . '' Aaron joked , which earned him a light hearted punch from both Max and Erica . <newline> `` Erica ... '' Max began , his voice catching in his throat . <newline> `` Mmyess ? '' She asked . <newline> Max got down on one knee . <newline> ___ <newline> Some time later <newline> ___ <newline> `` I do n't know man , The butterflies are really active right now . Can we postpone about a few minutes ? '' Max asked Aaron . Aaron sighed and used a lint roller to remove any hair from the suit . <newline> `` It 's a tight schedule as it is , we ai n't got time . '' Aaron lied . Sometimes you just had to kick Max into gear , he thought . With his hand on Max 's back , Aaron led him , or rather pushed him , to the altar . <newline> As Max took deep breaths to settle his nerves the music started , and an angel in white walked down the aisle . <newline> ___ <newline> Some time later <newline> ___ <newline> `` Oh man , the butterflies are everywhere today ! '' Max said to Erica , who lay on a hospital bed . <newline> `` Do n't worry about it , Max , those butterflies mean nothing . It 's a routine check up on Sh- the fetus . '' Erica comforted him . <newline> `` I know that , but seriously , could n't he get here quicker , I 'm dying of antici- '' Max was interrupted by the doctor walking in . <newline> `` Hello Erica , how are we today ? '' He asked . <newline> `` I 'm good , Doc . Just waiting for the day to come , you know . Kinda want to walk around normal again , not waddle . '' Erica laughed , and Max wondered how he got so lucky to have her as a wife . <newline> `` I hear you there , my wife was the same way . '' The doctor brought the stethoscope up to Erica 's chest first . `` All 's good up here , let 's check the baby . '' He brought the cold metal down to the swollen belly as he smiled . <newline> The smiled disappeared quickly . <newline> ___ <newline> Some time later <newline> ___ <newline> `` I 'm just always nervous now , Aaron , like i 'm in one of those butterfly atriums , or rather my body is one ... she just has n't been the same since the miscarriage . '' Max explained . <newline> Aaron nodded , he had dealt with similar things in his life . `` She 's going through a tough time Max . Just be there . '' <newline> `` You 're saying that like I 'm not . I am there , and I 'm not saying something like 'I want the old Erica back ' or anything , I 'm just ... '' Max took a deep breath to relax . `` I 'm just venting man . She just sits on her side of the bed all day , I 'm suddenly the only adult . I just want her to get better . '' <newline> Aaron was silent for a time , and then answered . `` Time heals all wounds . It 's been a year , and you know she 's not catatonic anymore . She 's started moving around at least . she 'll get back into the swing of things . Just be a good foundation for her to build on , and things will go swimmingly . '' <newline> Max thanked him and hung up the skype call . With a glance at the clock he decided it was lunch time and made a meal for two . <newline> `` Erica , would you like to eat down here ? '' He called up , but no answer came . `` Erica ? '' He called again . He started up the stairs and got to his bedroom before he smelled it . He knew that smell . <newline> He opened the door slowly to the dimly lit room . The light source flickered from the slight movement in the air . <newline> Scented candles . <newline> `` Hello Max . '' Erica purred . <newline> `` Oh . '' <newline> ___ <newline> Some time later <newline> ___ <newline> The alarm blasted Max awake , and immediately he was besieged by butterflies . It was his son 's , Dillon 's , first day at school , and he wanted it to be magical . He ran down the stairs and started making a lunch for Dillon . Balogna on white , with american cheese and mayonnaise , like his father made him . A banana sat next to it in the lunch bag , and atop it all he placed a note . <newline> `` Today 's a magical day , son . Make the most of it , make some friends , make some memories , and make me proud . Love , Dad '' <newline> `` I mean , it 's not too sappy . '' Erica said as she descended the stairs . Max jumped a little , before asked `` Was I writing and talking at the same time ? '' <newline> `` Yup . '' Erica affirmed as she poured a cup of coffee for herself . <newline> They had a quick meal and then woke up Dillon . <newline> `` I do n't wan na go to school dad , I 'm sick . '' Dillon lied . Max picked him up and slung him over his shoulder , all the while making the sounds of an 'angry monster ' . Dillon was laughing by the time they got to the table for the kids cereal . <newline> Just before the bus arrived , Dillon asked his dad `` I 've got butterflies dad . Do I got ta go to school ? '' <newline> Max knelt down and placed his hands on Dillons shoulders . `` Sometimes , quite often in fact , I get butterflies too . I 've learned how to ignore them . '' <newline> `` Really , how do you ignore them dad ? '' Dillon looked up in awe . <newline> `` I got used to it , mostly . I got scared enough that , eventually , I could n't be scared by most things . '' Max answered . <newline> `` I hope I 'm as brave as you are , some day , dad ! '' Dillon buttered his dad up . <newline> `` Thanks , but you 're still going to school . '' Max laughed and tried to stand . He could n't , his knees just froze . He did n't let on anything was wrong , he just waved as his son walked onto the school bus . He did n't even call out until vision began to blur . <newline> `` Erica ! '' He cried as he fell to the ground . <newline> ___ <newline> Some time later <newline> ___ <newline> `` Doc , what is it ? '' Max asked as soon the masked man entered the room . <newline> `` Well , that 's not an easy question to answer . '' The doctor began uncertainly . <newline> `` Please , just explain . I 'm not too stupid , I should get most of it . '' Max tried to smile , but found he had no energy for it . <newline> `` It 's some kind of stomach ... illness . We thought a cancer at first , but it 's not acting like a cancer , and then we thought a virus , but it 's much too large to- '' The doctor was interrupted by Erica 's sobs . Max ran his hand through her hair , trying to comfort her . `` The quick version , then ? '' <newline> `` Right , well , we think it 's a fleshy parasite , as compared to a worm . We 're guessing its rate of growth based on a few samples we took , and we think you 've had it about ten or so years . '' The doc answered . He looked to Erica 's sobbing form with a hard to discern expression . Sympathy ? Concern ? Apathy ? <newline> `` How long do you think ? '' Max asked . <newline> `` At worst , 5 years . At best , 15 . '' The doctor stated bluntly . He continued `` We 're currently running tests to see what we can do to stop the spread of the parasite , and that might even lengthen your life by another decade or more . '' <newline> Max nodded at the doctors words , barely discerning them from the sobs of Erica . `` When can I go home ? '' <newline> `` We have to make sure it is n't contagious first , but if we know that it is n't , you can go home immediately . '' <newline> `` How long can he expect to be here ? '' Erica asked between choked breaths . <newline> `` A few weeks . '' The doctor said . <newline> Max sighed and began a long wait . <newline> ___ <newline> 20 years later <newline> ___ <newline> Max 's hair , now grey , lay limply against the pillow . A mask hugged his face , and the sounds of life sustaining machinery surrounded him . But , if he listened hard enough , he could hear the wriggling of the butterflies in his ears ... the damnable bug burrowing around his body . <newline> Through sheer will power he lasted as long as he had . He had one other child , a Daughter named Mary , and stayed around long enough to see her off to college . It was the first day of spring break when he was sick , for the last time . <newline> His bed was surrounded by friends and family , and he was at peace . He looked to them all , and spoke to them one by one . His will was settled , he simply wished for them to know his feelings . <newline> `` Aaron , you 're here . '' Max began. `` It 's been a long time since we first met on the playground . I still remember how I stopped those bullies from hurting you . '' <newline> `` You were the one being bullied . '' Aaron corrected , trying to mask his tears with a wry smile . <newline> `` Eh , details . I 'm thankful you 're here for me , for the end . '' <newline> `` I said to the end of the line , and I was n't lying . '' Aaron 's facade broke for a moment as he sniffled , and a stray tears fell . Max nodded and grabbed his hand , giving it a quick squeeze before moving to the next person by his bed . <newline> He talked and he talked , thanking each person there for the time they spent with him . He reminisced about the good memories for a moment or two with each . The hardest where his children . Mary cried silently , unable to speak for most of his talk to her . Dillon , for his part , managed to hold back his tears . <newline> `` My eyes are just sweating . '' He said . Max knew Dillon was trying to be strong , for his mother and sister . But now was an okay time to be weak . Among friends and family , you do n't have to wear your armor or carry your sword . <newline> `` Erica ... You are one of the brightest ... you ... you make me lose my words right now ... '' Max struggled for a moment . `` You have made me happier than any husband in the world . And I 'm sorry I 'm leaving you . I ... '' Max looked to everyone else and asked for a little privacy , for his last requests . They all filed out of the room . <newline> `` Try to live life to the fullest . I 'm the dead one , not you . '' Max said . Erica laughed as she cried , barely holding it together . `` And ... it ai n't right for you to go it alone , so I do n't mind if you remarry . '' <newline> Erica laughed again , before kissing him on his lips and whispering in his ears . <newline> She said she loved only him .
"
7,"Only she said she loved him . <newline> He remembered all the good and the bad times as family and friends spoke their memories . In time it was his turn to stand and speak . He walked to the front of the room and stood at the podium . Before he spoke he looked around the room and saw all the love she had spread . <newline> `` The world will be a darker place without her . I will always remember my mother. `` <newline> That is all he says for that is all he can put to words . <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> <newline> Not the best but wanted to share the idea .

7,"The social worker looked through John 's file . Like many orphans , he had almost become lost in the system . He was too old for most people to consider him for adoption . He bounced between one foster family and the next , never staying anywhere more than a few months before being handed off like an ugly sweater . No one seemed willing to put up with the boys temper , his coldness , or his cynicism . <newline> <newline> Everything had been tried . Endless therapy sessions only seemed to drive him further into his shell or make him more hostile . He only put forth the bare minimum in his classes and could not seem to make any friends . The only thing that had shown any marks of success was animal therapy . He had even requested to volunteer at an animal shelter at one of his last foster homes . Even that seemed to only help so far . Though he displayed tremendous affection and care for the animals , he stay just as withdrawn from other people , if not more so . <newline> <newline> So when a petition for adoption from the boy 's current caretaker came across Susan Cox 's desk , she decided this case required more than the basic due process . She wanted to investigate it personally . Magnolia Cartwright was on the losing end of 50 and looked more like she should be visiting grandchildren instead of caring for a child on the cusp of adolescence . Also the fact that she was a widow did not paint an ideal picture of an adopter . Still her record with foster kids was good , and Susan was at least willing to hear her out . <newline> <newline> During their first interview , two things stuck out to Susan . First was that Mrs. Cartwright was exactly as she had pictured her . Short greying hair , dark eyes , and a warm smile made a face that was almost stereotypical it looked so maternal . The second thing , was that John was nothing like she had expected . His file had painted a miserable child , lonely and mistrusting of others . Well he was certainly shy and a little awkward when Mrs. Cartwright gently pushed him to say hello , but much more in a natural timid fashion and not the coolness she was expecting . Here before her was a boy with a terrible amount of hurt in his eyes , but not one without hope . Where there is hope there is a chance for healing . <newline> <newline> Susan stayed and talked to the two of them longer than her visit demanded . There would be more interviews in the future , but if they all followed the first , Susan would glad sign the adoption papers to approve Mrs. Cartwright to adopt John . As Mrs. Cartwright walked Susan out to her car , Susan finally asked the question that had been on her mind all afternoon . How had this lady succeeded in getting through to this boy when so many others had failed . <newline> <newline> Susan kept thinking about the answer all the way home . Many people had tried to fix John . They lectured , medicated , diagnosed , analyzed , and treated him , but only she said she loved him .

7,"There were bad nights , and then there were *bad* nights . This was one of the latter . <newline> <newline> The reporter had seen any number of bad nights , back when he was working in the city . You could n't avoid it , really -- there was always something , and working the crime beat only drove that point home . Everyone blamed it on the nature of city life ; people were made to be social creatures , but not like that . Not crammed together like sardines , barely knowing their neighbors . That was why he had moved out here . No drugs , barely any violence beyond the occasional drunken spat ; a nice place for an old journalist to live out his last years , covering local sports and the yearly harvest festival . <newline> <newline> The reporter had already been inside the charming little two-story house , walked the rooms filled with knick-knacks and family heirlooms . He had seen one of the deputies , the one who had n't been retching out on the lawn , trying to steady her hands enough to photograph the shattered pieces of the cheap `` Cider King '' trophy he had written a puff piece on only three months prior . He had nearly tripped on the toy train , carelessly sprawled in front of the door to the hallway . The hallway that had three bloody handprints smeared on its walls , at varying heights . <newline> <newline> The scene at the end of that hallway ... Well . The reporter already had nightmares ; what was one more ? <newline> <newline> He watched as the suspect was led , unresisting , to the waiting squad car , the only one in town . Watched as dried blood flaked off of the murder 's hands as they were , almost absently , rubbed against one another . Watched as the monster 's lips moved , soundless through the car window , as the sheriff climbed into the front seat . <newline> <newline> Hours later , the reporter stared into his drink , the sheriff sitting next to him doing the same . Later , he would remember the grain of the wood , how it was discolored from drink and other substances . Once , it have would seem odd that his memory would focus so narrowly on something inconsequential , but after the last few decades , it has become old hat . Better to dwell on the mundane details , anyway . <newline> <newline> A noise brought him back to himself , and the reporter realized that he had missed something the sheriff had murmured into her drink . <newline> <newline> `` What was that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It was ... in the car . '' The sheriff looked at him with haunted eyes . Eyes that knew , even if the mind behind them had n't admitted it , that things would never be quite right again . `` The only thing she said the entire time we were there . 'She said she only loved him . ' ``
"
7,"He 'd been alone for his whole life . He lay in the hospital bed , hearing the beeps of the machines around him . He could hear the noise of doctors and nurses rushing about outside his door . He thought back through his life , thinking about the people he 'd known , the friendships he 'd formed . He smiled . Then , his mind focused on her . <newline> <newline> He 'd been fifteen when they 'd met . They 'd spent the good part of three years together . Close friends . He could still remember her scent , see her smile , hear her laughter . He 'd loved her so much , yet never could tell her how he felt . <newline> <newline> He 'd remembered the day she left . Her big job opportunity on the other side of the world . He was excited for her . He knew this meant so much to her . Yet he was selfish and wanted her to stay . He knew this would be his only chance to tell her how he felt . Yet he 'd never had the courage . He waited till the day she left . This was his moment . <newline> <newline> He 'd gotten to her house , the taxi waiting to take her to the airport . all he had to say was three little words . He 'd pulled her aside . `` So , I guess you are going now . '' She nodded . `` Will we ever see each other again ? '' he asked . She looked away . He knew what that meant . It was either now or never . `` Uh- '' he was cut off by her words . <newline> <newline> `` James . I just want you to know that ... .I love you . '' She then leaned in and kissed him . The shock hit him harder than anything . He lost his words , he could only stare . The taxi beeped its horn , and all he could do was stand there and watch as she got in and it drove away . Looking back , he 'd known he 'd made the biggest mistake of his life . <newline> <newline> Later in his years , he could afford to look for her , and look he did . But he never found her . He 'd returned home , empty and alone . He lived out the rest of his life leading up to this day in the hospital . and as he closed his eyes for the last time , he 'd thought of her . The girl he 'd loved for his entire life . He 'd met other girls through the years , but he 'd only loved her . His heart slowed down , and he slowly passed away , one thought on his mind . <newline> <newline> Only she said she loved him .
"
7,"He was a loner , sure he had friends but no one really understood him . She was a band geek , always eager to learn . They met one day by a complicated accident and fate took hold . <newline> <newline> He had a dream at nine years old about the girl he was going to spend forever with . It came to rule his upbringing . He molded himself in to the perfect man for that girl . Sure , it was a far out idea , trying to live for a girl you never thought existed , but he did n't mind . Thinking of her gave him strength , especially when he was contemplating suicide , which he did often . He would think of that dream and realize he had to be strong for her . He loved her without ever having met her . <newline> <newline> She lived a strained life , full of tears and anguish . A mother who said she never measured up and a father who never cared . Her heart was heavy with the pain of the world , an empath in the truest sense . She loved the earth and cared for it , she was mindful of her impact and did n't mind telling you of yours . A vegetarian simply because her heart could n't bear knowing that a poor animal had lost its life to give her nourishment . A caring and loving soul . <newline> <newline> From the moment they met , they knew they had found the one to spend forever with . He asked her to marry him on the first date , and she agreed with a smile , not knowing how serious he was . They began to love in such a fashion that everyone noticed . They noticed the way they smiled when they talked about each other . They noticed the way she laughed more then she ever had around him . They noticed the way he smiled with his eyes when he looked at her . <newline> <newline> They lived a happy life together . The day finally came when they were husband and wife . She bore him children and he worked hard to give her the best life he could . Their children saw how much their parents were in love and strived to find the same thing in their life . <newline> <newline> Age was kind to both of them and they loved deeply through time . One day he told her about his dream , he thanked her for always being a driving force in his life . For being such a benefit to his existence , and for making him happy he had n't died before he met her . <newline> <newline> He said `` I 've always loved you '' <newline> <newline> She said she loved only him . <newline>
"
7,"They tried anyway , even though they both knew it was going to be hopeless . The first few days there was a sparkle in her eyes like something new and optimistic despite herself , emotion in a grey world she 'd long given up for tedious . <newline> <newline> It faded eventually , like everything else about them - her face the same as always but the light that he kept looking for was lost , dulled , stolen . What had once been new and wonderful became consumed like everything else by the fog . Sunlight did n't disperse the gloom , nor rain , nor changing seasons , nor flowers . <newline> <newline> He was dutiful . They would sometimes just sit in a dark room for hours , unmoving , her laying across his lap , her feet propped up on the arm of the sofa . Her body was limp , more like a lead statue than a girl , no energy to escape the nothing inside . <newline> <newline> She asked him to leave sometimes , told him he was wasting his time on her , and he refused . After that they stopped talking . There was n't much point , there was no change , nothing to add . They embraced the silence like a cold comfort . The dust gathered , and the laundry , and the dishes , and the bills , a mountain to bury them . <newline> <newline> That last day the sheet laid softly over her , billowing like curtains as they wheeled away the gurney . He clutched the pill bottle they 'd found on her , and wished she 'd taught him to stop caring . <newline> <newline> He 'd wanted to save her . She said she loved him , only it had never been enough .
"
7,"After they kissed for the first time that night he remembers them just lying there , interlocking fingers and looking into each other ’ s eyes . The movie was no longer relevant to them . It felt so right to just be thinking about her and holding her hand for that moment in time they felt as if to be one . <newline> He tightened his grip the teeniest bit and spoke in almost a whisper . <newline> <newline> <newline> “ ..are you feeling it again ? ” he asks almost breezily , still gripping her hand . <newline> His heart feels like it will take off out of his chest through his mouth at any moment . He sweats profusely and feels nauseous . Trying to fight the urge to just kiss her and tell everything would be fine . But he simply couldn ’ t . <newline> <newline> <newline> She nods and smirks . “ something like it ” butterflies fill her stomach . A feeling she first felt after kissing him . <newline> His heart ignites in tiny bursts of happiness . It feels amazing . He was so happy she was happy in this very moment . He didn ’ t want to be the reason she had a relapse . But he also knew he really wanted to be a part of this historic , once in a lifetime opportunity . <newline> <newline> <newline> She smiled truly beautiful smile- a smile that could no doubt end world wars . <newline> And yet all at the same time , start them . <newline> A simple smile that could wreak havoc and fix everything , mend broken hearts all in a day . And he was lucky enough to call her his beautiful girlfriend . <newline> She said she loved him in the only way she knew how . <newline>

7,"There they sat , two old friends over a beer at their favorite bar in the neighborhood they grew up together in . He had just gotten in a fight with his girlfriend , she had offered to meet up with him so he could tell her about it . He told her how bad things had gotten and how he was still willing to fight for his relationship . She listened intently with the most sincere concern for her best friend . After he had vented and relaxed , they started reminiscing about their years of friendship . How it all started when she scraped her knee and he showed up out of nowhere with a smiley faced band-aid when they were 7 . How she had been to all his high school football games , even though he rode the bench every season . On how their last night together before going to different colleges they got drunk and shared a kiss , no matter how brief . During all the sharing of fond memories , she felt a warmth in her body , and a sharp sting in her chest . Her breathing got heavier and she felt euphoric . Suddenly he got a message . It was from his girlfriend . She asked what it said and he answered `` She says she only loves me '' . He got up and said goodbye , hugged her as he usually does when they depart . Something felt different , but he paid no mind to it until he got home to his girlfriend . Saying goodbye to his best friend was the same as usual , only she said she loved him . <newline> <newline> Edit : first time .

7,"It 's nothing . She was nothing . No big deal . <newline> He 'll be out there again in no time , back on the horse , ready for the same old rodeo . It 's all about the ride . <newline> Crying is fine , you cry it out . Soon he 'll look back and laugh . *Did I really cry over her ? * He 's hormonal . He 's hungover . He 's horny , that 's all . <newline> She was nothing . <newline> Nothing but the next one , before the one after that and the one after that . <newline> She had flaws , loads of them . He always saw them , right them from the start . She 'd take out all her insecurities on him : holding his hand when she felt scared , hoping he 'd save her from ridicule , depending on him to help when she got lonely , scared , or sad . And now none of that - and that 's good . <newline> Now he 's his own man . <newline> No one waiting for him to come home , asking how long he 'll be , where he is , what he 's doing . No - no one constantly wanting to be around him . <newline> Freedom . <newline> Free like a young man should be . Nothing tying him down . No one telling him what to do . Finally he can do what he wants without worrying about what someone else thinks . He 's too young to settle . <newline> All that weight dropped . It 's no surprise he can still feel it hanging heavy . It 's just another flex . The heart is a muscle and when it heals it gets stronger . The bigger the hurt , the stronger it gets . <newline> But she was nothing . <newline> Nothing worth crying about . <newline> She only said she loved him .

7,"He came home , as he always did , at precisely 6 pm . <newline> Suitcase laid on the table . Tie loose around his neck . <newline> He made his way to the couch . Click . The TV awoke . <newline> <newline> She walked into the room without his attention . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm leaving , '' she says to the back of his head . <newline> <newline> `` OK , see you later . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . I 'm leaving , '' she repeats . <newline> <newline> He turns to face her , registering the seriousness of the statement . When he understands , he finds his legs and looks her in the eyes . <newline> <newline> `` Put the suitcase down , Amelia . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm leaving . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , you 're not . '' <newline> <newline> `` I am leaving , Dale . There is no discussion . '' <newline> <newline> A twitch in his eye alerts the change in temperament , but when the force of his voice caroms off the walls of their two-bedroom duplex , her stoic demeanor cowers . <newline> <newline> `` No ! No . We are having a discussion . You are not leaving . And you will sit down . '' <newline> <newline> She remains still . Only her white knuckles betraying fear . <newline> <newline> `` Amelia , do you see what I 've given you ? '' He says gesturing to the small living room , but implying the world . `` This house ? Your clothes ? Your food and your car ? ! '' <newline> <newline> He pauses . Waiting for *her* apology . When it does n't come , he becomes furious . <newline> <newline> `` For Christ 's sake , Amelia , I 've given you your life ! What the fuck could be missing ? ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Only love , '' she said to him .

7,"A man is known to lose himself sometimes . It 's in his nature . <newline> <newline> Some men have a short fuse . The type that 's always angry , you know ? Usually real insecure , always looking for a reason to be insulted so they can yell about themselves . <newline> <newline> Some men ... well , they 're just pitiful nice guys . They 're broken , backwards creatures ; known to bemoan the inevitability of their own failure , they put women on a pedestal and expect to be loved in return . This technique never works , and often leaves the pitiful man feeling bitter and resentful . <newline> <newline> Jeff , I suppose , you could say was a little bit of both . I still ca n't believe he done what they say he did . None of us could . They always seemed like they was such a sweet couple , him and that Hilstead girl . Nora . <newline> <newline> I remember talking to her , maybe a week or two before the news broke . We bumped into each other downtown . Just the usual chitchat , you know ? I asked how Jeff was doing and she got this funny look on her face . Said he 'd been acting kind of odd lately . Staying up real late , not eating much , you know , that sort of thing . Nothing outrageously peculiar . <newline> <newline> And I remember clear as day , I do n't think I can ever forget , the last thing she said about it was , `` I do n't know . I love him , only ... '' <newline> <newline> She did n't finish . Just sort of ... trailed off . She knew something was off , that something was n't right . She did n't know what , unfortunately , otherwise we would n't be sitting here talking . But she knew . I just ca n't stop thinking about that . <newline> <newline> She said she loved him , only ...

7,"As he sat alone in the park on a hot summer day , it occurred to him that *she* was becoming the only thing he cared about . What she said to him , how she said it , if she spoke to him at all -- he felt so close ! It was all that mattered . *She* was all that mattered . <newline> <newline> He continued to ponder the thought while idly watching a small trickle of ice cream stream down his hand . His phone vibrated . Suddenly , he felt a rush of energy surging through him like a storm . His eyes quickly darted to the name that popped up on the screen : MOM . *Oh . * He let out a long breath and completely deflated . It was the 5th time she had called in the last 15 minutes , which was ... unusual , but still , he could n't be bothered . Not now . Not after what just happened . <newline> <newline> Just then , he felt a cool splash on his big toe . Then , the other big toe . He looked down and saw a smattering of ice cream pooling on the ground -- he 'd forgotten his ice cream was dripping . He *hated* feeling sticky , but he did n't care . Not today . He kept searching . Waiting . Ice cream in both hands . His favorite , and hers . What a surprise , he thought she 'd say . How thoughtful ! He scanned the park once more when he thought he saw her , in the distance , coming towards him . The ruby red hair tumbling over her shoulders , it had to be her . Had to be ! He could feel the storm within rising again , gusting , whipping his heart . He could n't wait to tell her what had happened . Maybe now she 'll *see* him , truly *see* him , as he sees her . Hopefully then , maybe.. just maybe.. it could be as it was in his dreams -- when she said she only loved him .

7,"She left before I got there . Where 'd she go ? I said . Everybody shrugged , but they had this conspiratorial look they get when they think they 're keeping something from me . I knew they put her up to something . They were doing that a lot then . Send the new girl out for CPU fluid or RAM cluster cleaner or a bag of fried ham from McDonald 's , a secret item you could only get if you demanded it via a note made from cut up magazines . They have to do it , they told her , but only if you bring the note . Made up things . <newline> <newline> Six hours later she was back and asking me about money like I 'd sent her out on some errand . What did they send you for , I said , saying each word slowly so they would pass the hazy gelatinous ooze in which her brain swam , the byproduct whatever they were smoking now . She smelled of wasp spray , drain cleaner , and mint . There was almost nothing left in her eyes . If she 'd ever been anything , anything at all , it was burn out and clinking around inside the bulb . <newline> <newline> Geoff , she said . <newline> <newline> That 's not my name , I said . <newline> <newline> That 's what they sent me for . <newline> <newline> A person ? I said , loud enough so the rest of them could hear me . They stifled their laughter and hid behind their monitors , the bright orange bulbs of their pipes glowing in the dim blue light . Where is he ? I said . <newline> <newline> She asked me again for money . She tried to reach into my pocket as she asked . I tried to meet her eyes . She looked at the floor . I shook her by the shoulders and asked her again . Where is he ? <newline> <newline> She explained . She said his friends would find him a few days . He was a recluse , she said . <newline> <newline> How did you know him ? <newline> <newline> She asked again for money . She said she only loved him .

7,"It was the longest day of his life -- potentially his last . A day of never ending darkness and blurs of light as the sounds of mechanical beeps and pumps filled his empty mind . He lay amidst supposed friends and family . No one cried , that he could see . Tubes and ceiling obscured his vision . One by one they left until only one stayed . He could hear her . His daughter . In her early 20 's now , he thought . He 'd been in this state for so long he does n't even remember . But the love he had for her and her late mother still flourished . His heart beat heavily as she stood into his vision . His mind cut in and out . `` You were always there ... I wished you could have walked me down the aisle ... You 'd love your granddaughter ... '' He wanted to cry but could n't . `` I 'll never forget you , daddy , '' she whispered as she bent down to kiss his cheek . The warmth of her lips and tears caressed the side of his face . He felt her lips quiver as the need to cry , touch and kiss her back like a father should filled his soul . As she stood he heard a click and the room slowed to silence . No beeps . No pumps . Just him and his daughter . `` Good bye , daddy . I love you so much . '' <newline> <newline> She held his hand until the end . Just then he knew , while the room faded to darkness , with his daughter in sight he knew : only she said she loved him .

7,"He sat in his dressing gown and slippers , his silvery hair still wet from the shower , the morning glow lighting up the mail as he passed his fingers through the envelopes scanning for anything of interest . His wife , whom he had n't loved in years , and was n't sure he 'd ever loved at all , called to him from the kitchen . <newline> <newline> `` Bacon ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Just tea . '' <newline> <newline> He found a letter with his schools insignia on it . He tore open the envelope to reveal the yearbook picture of a pretty young girl with yesterday 's date blazoned on the letterhead , a date of birth underneath it . The letter began : `` The Charter School is deeply saddened by the loss of Marigold Peters . '' <newline> <newline> He stopped reading there , and put down the letter . He remembered how in the 10th grade he 'd made the foolish , boyish gesture of bringing Marigold ( Mary ) Peters a bouquet of Peonies to their 9am Literature class . A card was attached , quoting a poem he knew she 'd liked from her remarks in class . The whole class erupted into laughter . He ran out of the class , tears in his eyes , horribly embarrassed . He 'd managed to forget the whole thing by avoiding every sight of her for the rest of his time . <newline> <newline> If only he 'd turned around as he ran out the door , he would 've seen her running after him . If only he 'd stayed , he would 've seen her smile at him and playfully jest that he was an idiot . If only he 'd come back the next day or the next week to the same class , she would 've told him that was adorably awkward of him . He 'd thought all these years that she hated him for making a scene . <newline> <newline> He thought , `` good riddance '' as he put the card in the trash and sipped on the tea his wife had put in front of him . He could finally forget all about Mary who had hated him . <newline> <newline> Only , she had said she loved him .
"
7,"It was just like all the other times that he 'd stormed out of the house , slamming the door on his way out . <newline> <newline> She 'd stand there in the kitchen while she listened to the rumble of the motorbike start , tears streaming down her face as she watched the headlight pass the kitchen window . <newline> <newline> Sure , it was n't a perfect marriage and yeah , they fought a lot but they made it work . <newline> <newline> Except for that night . <newline> <newline> On his way through the door , the argument still fresh in his mind , his cheek stinging from where she 'd hit him , he heard her say something . <newline> <newline> 2 hours later , he was pronounced dead on the scene by an ambulance driver who had the unfortunate chance to be passing by . <newline> <newline> Claire showed up to the scene in shock , with sirens blaring and the lights engulfing the area but nothing seemed to touch her . <newline> She moved through the crowd , ignoring the police officer who tried to stop her . <newline> Upon reaching the crumbled up remains of the motorbike , she looked around , finding his body lying on the ground not too far away , his neck twisted at a grotesque angle . <newline> A note , in his hand , bending down , she grabbed it out , ripping away from an officer who tried to console her . <newline> <newline> The note had been ripped in the accident and his blood stained the paper but she could make out some words ... <newline> <newline> `` You said you loved him ? Then be with him '' <newline> <newline> Claire sat there , struggling to remember saying those words , with the rain saturating her , the lights of the vehicles around her blinding , the sirens blaring . <newline> All of a sudden the tears erupted from her face and she broke down . A firm hand was placed on her shoulder and she was been led over to an ambulance . <newline> <newline> In the fight , on his way out the door , he must of heard her say something and assumed that she said that . <newline> <newline> Only , she said that she loved him . <newline> <newline>
"
7,"`` But I love you '' said Natalie , with that sentence he tried to give her a consoling smile , but he knew he 'd broken her heart . That did n't matter though , not really . He felt compelled , he loved Jessica , he always had . This was the right decision , he told himself that . <newline> <newline> He 'd met Jessica a year ago and instantly felt that he had a connection to her . They 'd become quite close , and after racking up the courage he finally had asked her out . She 'd said rejected him , `` I do n't really feel that way about you , but you 're my best friend and I want us to spend time together '' . Deluded , he hung around , hoping that one day she 'd come around . He tried again at the end of the school year , just before the summer started . Again , she 'd put him down gently . It was then that he decided to cut ties with Jessica , explaining to her that he wanted either to be more than friends or not be a major part of her life . <newline> <newline> Over the summer he got close to Natalie , she 'd lived down the street and they 'd always caught the same bus to a nearby shopping mall , then walked home together . Natalie was pretty , far more attractive than Jessica . He dated Natalie for three months , Jessica rarely , if ever , crossed his mind . <newline> <newline> It was the first week of school that he saw Jessica for the first time in months . She asked to talk to him one lunch time , confessing that she did like him after all and wanted to have a relationship with him . He did n't need convincing , believing she was the one . He swiftly broke Natalie 's heart . <newline> <newline> The first month was great . Things started to get strange towards the end of the second month , one day Jessica ended it , saying she was no longer attracted him . He felt like he 'd made the biggest blunder of his life , surprised at how easily he discarded Natalie . She only said she loved him .

7,"`` Tell us the story of the girl you fell in love with . '' The neighborhood kids gathered around the old man , wanting to hear the story he told everyone in town . The kids knew it by heart , but they still gathered before dark to hear the tales this man could tell . He leaned back in his chair and sighed . `` I suppose it could n't hurt anything . '' He took in a breath and started to recall the memory of the girl he once had loved . <newline> When we were children , she was my best friend . My only friend . When I reached the age where life beats you and breaks you and all you see is darkness , she was the little light at the end of it all . Finally , when I reached adulthood , I wanted her for my own . I wanted to feel her soft hair as it flowed like a blond river down to her waist . I wanted to gently brush my fingers across her skin as she moved like ballet dancer . <newline> But what I wanted was not to be . <newline> She fell . Like a flower in the wintertime , she wilted and collapsed into ash . She was snatched away from her dreams until she stopped dreaming because she saw no comfort in it any more . Until one day her dreams became her life : Taken away in the blink of an eye . She stood waiting to fall . Wanting to fall . Like a rose that is crushed underfoot , she became broken . And all it took was a step . I wept . I sobbed . I cried out to whatever God might be listening , but to no avail . I only wished she knew that I loved her . It 's possible to die and your body can still function but your mind can be so dead , it might as well have not been there at all . That 's what happened to her . She presented her heart on a silver platter to someone who tossed it around like it was a toy . You see , my children , she died the moment he said `` I do n't care '' when she said she `` loved him only . ''
"
7,"She only said she loved him . He was heartbroken . Years of devotion , only to realize it never meant a thing to her . And it was that realization that began his downward spiral . <newline> <newline> He spent days with by coworkers who did n't see him , and nights with empty bottles in which he could only see himself . One such night , he picked up a phone . Months had passed since they 'd last spoken , and he put on a brave voice . Convinced her that he was happy , convinced her it really was mutual , but he could n't convince himself . He did n't even convince her . At the end of the call , she said only she loved him , with an emphasis on past tense . <newline> <newline> He did n't spend many nights with bottles anymore . Just hours looking down a barrel . He was n't happy , and yet she was . No more suffering , no more pain . He 'd finally do it one of these nights . But that night never came . Each day he woke up , and each day he was a little less miserable . Maybe it was time for another phone call . <newline> <newline> She picked up after the first ring . He was calm , but she was not - the opposite of their last contact . She rambled on about why they broke up . He was always at work , he was always busy , he was always distant , he was always just a little too much work to love . He did n't quite understand it when she said she only loved him . But he felt at peace for the first time in a year . <newline> <newline> A decade passed and things were looking up . He was engaged to a woman he loved . He was up for a big promotion . He 'd taken up an interest in model cars . He still thought about her occasionally , but remembered her fondly for the good times rather than the bad . But one day , he gets a call . She 's gone , turned on the gas and went to sleep . A note on her night stand is all that 's left . She said she loved only him .
"
7,"He felt gone . Nothing was left now that she had left . <newline> <newline> They had been together since they met one day at the cafe across from his office . His job was slightly classified . Her job was teaching a class , of kindergarteners . It seemed like love at first sight . Serendipity . She had waved him over to her table when he chose , for the first time in months , to steo out for lunch . She was a tourist from one of the outer boroughs , stopping between attractions . They loved the same things . She was beautiful . He was smitten . <newline> <newline> They had dinner that night . They saw shows on Broadway that weekend . The night before she had to leave , she said she loved him . He said he loved her . He gave her what was , between the two of them , the most romantic gift possible : A multi-line pass to ride the trains into the city when she had time . <newline> <newline> They spent every vacation together ; he would spend his few days off visiting her , she would spend most weekends and scheduled no-class days visiting him . On long weekends , they went up north . <newline> <newline> One day , he got a call from the front desk of his office . She was here . She was waiting for him in the cafeteria on a guest pass . He feared something horrible , and rushed down . It was mixed news ; she was pregnant . To him , it was good news . He dropped to one knee and proposed on the spot . They were both overjoyed . <newline> <newline> She bought some bottles of sparkling cider from the commissary and he took her up to his office . His co-workers congratulated him on the catch that they were finally meeting . They went to his office to videochat his family from his mobile before his lunch hour ended . It never happened . <newline> <newline> He woke up on the carpet of his office , a spilled plastic cup of cider in his hand , a bitter taste in his mouth , and a sticky note on his forehead . `` Thanks for getting me past the air-gap , comrade . P.S . : I was on the pill . '' <newline> <newline> He loved her . She only said she loved him .
"
7,"Seconds passed . The crowd gazed on as he stood in the humiliating shambles of a mess he had created . It was a social nuke that destroyed his world , his future . As he left the church for the last time she came up from behind and touched his hand . Only she said she loved him . <newline> <newline> Minutes passed . He wrung the steering wheel like he could maybe squeeze a drop of old grease from its rubber . He sped out of the city , teeth clenched like the traffic he left behind . Where do you go from this ? All his friends , his whole world lost . But ... not all . She was there , the one light in the darkness . But no , it 's just a fantasy . She only said she loved him . <newline> <newline> Hours passed . He sat alone with the blank walls of his thoughts and house to entertain him . The shreds of his decorations remained strewn across his floor . Where do you start to rebuild when all that 's left is ash ? The light of his phone caught his eye . She said she had talked to them , but they remained unmoved . She said only she loved him . <newline> <newline> Days passed . Ignoring all calls , his phone eventually died . He liked the calm , he felt stable in this dull drywall cave . Finally she came knocking to see if he was alright . She knew he was in there , she said . Let her in , she said . It was the least he could do . She said she only *loved* him . <newline> <newline> Years passed . They were n't surrounded by flowers or friends or festivities , but it was beautiful to them nonetheless . They faced each other , smiling as broadly as could be . She the ring slid onto his finger before saying those closing two words . She said she loved only him . <newline> <newline> Decades passed . He rushed up the steps , through the blinding halls , and burst through the door . Strained , tired eyes stared back from the pits in her face . She had been sick for a year now , but she said she needed him today . She smiled weakly up at him . She said she loved him , only ... <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> *The implied last paragraph says : `` She passed . `` *
"
7,"They were ... Seventeen when it had happened . <newline> <newline> They matched over Tinder . He thought she was cute , she thought he was handsome . They got along well enough . He asked for her number . They talked more . He asked her out . She said yes . <newline> <newline> They met for dinner , and they talked . <newline> <newline> Talking was an understatement . <newline> <newline> They connected . They understood each other . They clicked . <newline> <newline> They told each other stories and watched videos of each other on their phones . He told her jokes and used his cheesy pickup lines . <newline> <newline> And she laughed . <newline> <newline> What a wonderful laugh . <newline> <newline> He looked at her , and she looked at him and they clasped hands together as if they 'd done it a hundred times before . He drove her home . They watched a movie . They kissed . <newline> <newline> They kissed . <newline> <newline> She 'd call him for help with her History homework . He 'd text her asking how to be a good Journalist . She 'd ask him how he was holding up . He 'd ask how her day went . She 'd tell him to go outside and look at the stars , he 'd tell her he could see Orion and Sagittarius . She 'd tell him good morning and have a good day , he 'd tell her to have a goodnight and sleep well . <newline> <newline> They clasped hands , and this time hey had done it a hundred times before . <newline> <newline> High school ended . <newline> <newline> College began . <newline> <newline> They said distance made the heart grow fonder . <newline> <newline> They lied . <newline> <newline> They fought . So much love between them , bringing them back together and begging to put their inhibitions aside . But they were prideful ones . Neither willing to admit , or accept fault . <newline> <newline> And then , there was no more 'and then ' . There was no more they . Just him , and her . <newline> <newline> But , while their story may be over , they do indulge in re-reading it 's pages now and again . Be it seeing an old picture , or an old friend 's mention . <newline> <newline> They both smile , because they knew for sure that once , many years ago ... <newline> <newline> He said he only loved her . <newline> <newline> She said she only loved him .
"
7,"I 'd see her walking down the hall , her hair fluttering in the wind , and want nothing more than to be able to hold her hand like the boy beside her did . I 'd long to feel it falling onto my shoulder the same way it did on those few nights we did have together . They never came often enough to make the distance between us feel any shorter , but there was n't much that could be done about that . <newline> <newline> Sometimes I 'd catch her looking back at me and every single time her eyes would be filled with that same desperate loneliness I knew too well for my own good . I 'd clutch the crucifix hanging from my neck and hold it over my heart in the hope that it might sooth the growing agony in my chest and almost as though I was looking into a mirror I would see her do the same . It never had the desired effect . My chest would ache and burn but at the very least I could take comfort in knowing that the two of us were burning together . <newline> <newline> Yet , as strange as it might seem , despite all that pain I did n't hate him in the slightest . In fact I felt nothing but pity when I 'd see the two of them walking hand in hand with only one genuine smile to share between them . It was n't jealousy that forced me to look away . Envy was n't why it always hurt so bad to see her fingers laced together with his . In the end the three of us were almost the same except for the fact that he was the only one not yet aware of the lie he was living . Only her and I had the courtesy of knowing that much . Not that either of us could ever muster the courage to tell him . No matter how badly we hurt it paled in comparison to the hell he would go through if he found out the truth . If any of the three of us deserved hell he deserved it the least . He deserved to be happy . He was a nice guy . If only that was what she wanted . <newline> <newline> I could n't have envied him even if I tried . How could I ? You ca n't be jealous of something that someone else does n't really have . I knew the truth . She loved me but could n't say it . She only said she loved him .
"
7,"Wait . <newline> <newline> Doubt was settling in . Hesitation as he looked down into the pits of where he was about to fall . <newline> <newline> Why did he always do this ? Days of preparation , countless times working up the courage to get this far , practicing the motion every single second he had the chance . <newline> <newline> And yet he could n't make the jump . Was it fear ? No . He had long since thrown his life away . There was n't a single reason to remain here in this world , alone . <newline> <newline> Not a single one . <newline> <newline> He caught himself trembling as he tried to convince himself of his little lie . Fine , he thought to himself . There was one reason . <newline> <newline> He had her . She said she loved him , and she said she loved him only . From the bottom of his heart , he had no idea if that were true , she only said she loved him . Who knew what she really felt ? <newline> <newline> But just those words were enough to reconsider his decision . What if they were true ? Could that really happen to someone like him ? <newline> <newline> He took a step back . <newline> <newline> And he immediately hated himself for it . What was the point ? Even if that were the case , what good could it do ? He was beyond love now . He was beyond everything . <newline> <newline> He was sure that she could move on from him . Unlike him , she had more in her . She deserved better . <newline> <newline> Something wet rolled down his cheek . It was not rain . The clouds were missing in a crystal clear sky . They were his emotions . Reminding him of how weak he is . How incredibly worthless of a coward he was . He hated it ! <newline> <newline> Well , he 'd show them weak . <newline> <newline> Without a second longer he rushed to the edge and took flight , free falling towards the ground and to his despair . <newline> <newline> No one would miss him . He was insignificant in everyone 's lives . It may be sad news for a little while , but he knew that that they would get over it . <newline> <newline> Except her . How she was going to deal with what was going to happen to him , he did not know . He did n't want to know , which was just fine since he would never find out . Still , it was fine . <newline> <newline> Because only she said she loved him .

7,"It started as a chauvinistic affair meant to make the masses happy at the expense of the 13 people involved . One women and a dozen men vying for her heart , and why not , she was truly an object to be beholden to . Yet that is the problem , to the viewers and the men alike she was seen as just that , an object to be desired . A thing to be owned and displayed , yet not to be loved . <newline> <newline> That was except for one man . He may have come from humble beginnings and did not have the fanciest of attires but there was an air about him that was quite endearing . He was raised in a modest household on a farm and truly knew the value of a hard days work , and rarely took things for granted . He was always taught that life rears only what is induced , and therefore worked harder than most anyone he knew to achieve what he had . <newline> <newline> While the other men may have been able to flaunt their high class society and proper use of a salad fork , he could show how the food arrived at the table . He still cared for his aging parents and never let a sibling fall upon hard times , even though he knew that they would quickly turn their heads as soon as he no longer aided them . But all of this made him into the man that he was , caring , thoughtful and a joy to be around . <newline> <newline> At the start of the competition she gave him no mind for she was more interested in superficial things than anything else . Therefore she spent most of her time talking to the strapping men with little to say , and wondered why she did not feel a connection . She did spend a little time with him , but never gave it much thought as the conversation was so easy and nice , and it felt as though she was talking to an old friend not a man vying for her affection . After a few weeks of getting rid of other people and almost him , it was a difficult decision that she was left with , but it truly was n't up to her . <newline> <newline> There were 5 men left , and 4 more episodes that needed many viewers , and poling proved that she was the only person who enjoyed the time together , minus himself of course . It was then that she had to make a hard decision , one she would later regret for most of her life . <newline> <newline> She handed the final token to another player and she broke the news , she said only she loved him . <newline>

7,"Izzard stalked through the once slicked stone paths , burgundy crusted stone tiles crunching underneath his loafers . Skids and splashes screamed their history like a visceral nightmare along the stone pathway . <newline> <newline> Torch flashes illuminated the garden through which the trails led him , the flower beds pristine , the bowers overhead crystalline with the stars light and the rainwater left from earlier showers . It was a testament to the passions of the night previous that the trail had not been washed away . A stone archway , itself now stained , splashed a ferrous brown , with crystals dashed crimson giving an almost heavenly look . Hand prints on the arch , petite like a child 's , played their way in the same rusty hue . Larger hand prints , smeared as though the finger tips had been clawing into the stone , wearing themselves into nubs , splayed themselves along the ground . <newline> <newline> Izzard glanced again at the oft read note . Smeared and tearstained parchment written in a panicked midnight hand . He 'd read it twice and once again still unsure of his meaning . <newline> <newline> Entering into the chateau , the trail took upon a new appearance , as though someone had inlaid redwood into the oak flooring . A lamp was knocked over , it 's oil leaving a shiny blackish residue . Izzard 's heard a clink under his sole to see a letter opener , smeared the same as the floor , and kicked it away . Other tools , such as pliers and screwdrivers and knives and files , began to make themselves known . Wire snippers here , scissors there , a scalpel across the room on the desk . <newline> <newline> Led to the bedroom , Izzard balked . Taking a moment to pull his shoulders back and untuck his chin , Izzard allowed his head to enter the chamber . He locked eyes with a gazeless Earnest , embracing an equally glassy Emmeline . Smiling , the one like a plastic surgeons triumphal creation , the other like a countess granted eternal youth , the two lovers laid as posed for a picture . Picture perfect couple . Izzard , a fourth and final time looked at the note . <newline> <newline> She said only she loved him .
"
7,"He said he loved her and he wanted her , so they started dating , and he shared his darkest secrets with her . <newline> <newline> He said he loved her and he needed her , so they moved in together , and he put her name on the deed . <newline> <newline> He said he loved her and he cared for her , so in his last will and testament he named her the sole beneficiary of his estate . <newline> <newline> He said he loved her and he trusted her , so he let her be his spotter when mountain climbing . <newline> <newline> He fell to his death , betrayed . She said she only loved him .
