0,"My standing postion on this cause is that computers are good for are technolgy today but if you think that your son or daughter is using today then you can put and block on how long they are on, also it can get comunacation from all arouind the world, and it has the speed of light so you can research stuff and do everythin gyou need to do faster. My first reason is that you can put a block on how long you or your children are on the computer. So if you are one of those pepiole who think that your son or daughter is on the computer to long then you can just put a block on it so they are not on it for more then you want them to be. Also if you think they are on sites they shouldt be then you can put a filter on the intrernet so they cant go on certain things. Also if they are on to long then you can just tell them they cant go on the computer for the rest of the night or sometning like that it is not there fault that pepole lose track of time and what if it is something that needs to be done by tonight and it is a really long thing they have to do or it is for there jobs. Also another one of my reason why computers are more helpful then not is they can let you talk to pepole from all around the world. One is they have chatting sites where you can blog and find new pepole to meet althought there are pepole who do make stuff for the rong purposes nowadays they have moniutours that matchi this things and do reasearch about them once they make a account so if they have done something then they will be closely watched by addminostratiors. Also what if you know someone who moved away and you still want to talk to them you can because of your computer and pepole always say use the phone what if you dont like to talk on the phone or you do like to talk on the phone but at your house you dont get cellphone service there and you cant talk to them because it is staticy so you can use your computer or laptop to chat with them over the web. Or maybe you want to talk to your cousins that moved away and you liked to talk to them a lot but you cant anymore. That is my seconde reason why computers are a good thing. My third reason is that you can search stuff a lot faster threew the computer then you can go threw a book cause a book you have to look for the right book then you have to find a good section of it but on the internet you can just go on a search enginge and you can search right what you need and most of the sites have a description of the site ritght under the web addres so you can see if it what you are looking for. Also what if you ned to have a job paper in tomrrow and you just got it and needs to be about something you dont know about at all you can ask someone over the web to help you and tell you what it is about so you can get it done and keep your job. Maybe in school you need to do a paper for a class and it is a new topic that you have never heard of and you need help witht eht work there are some sites that ave homework help on the wep that you can ask aosmone a question adnt ehy can help you answer it in a short answer or a long one if you need it and they will responde to you either in a little while or right away amnd it is ussaualy right away or in a couple minutes so they can help somone else. Also if you dont belive your computer is runing fast anymore you can just go onto some sites that will inhance your computer speed for no money at all unlike those downloading disk that take forever it is a statistic that for every one disk that someone buy there are @NUM1 pepole who use they intrernet to inhance the speed of your computer so it is 1/@NUM1 of the people who use the internet to inance your internet in minutes instead of those long periods to download instal on the computer that slow disk. That is my third reason why I hitnk that computers are a lot more helpfull then they are'nt."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1? Are you there?"" ""@CAPS2 you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necesity to an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but @CAPS2 they always prove trustworthy? Computers are alwasy reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others...that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you @CAPS2 choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personaly preffered option is @ORGANIZATION2 email. I myself have family in @LOCATION1, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families in @LOCATION2 say they have relatives that are far away. That is @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their famly. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you @CAPS2 interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student of @PERSON1, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that @MONTH1 be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible @CAPS3. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""@CAPS3 are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control,"" says @CAPS4, an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor @CAPS3. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn now things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!"""
0,"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after @CAPS1. Oh, how much you want to just relax in the natural free air, but with all the advances in technology you feel it's your job to always be updated. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. People aren't exercising interacting with family and friends in person, or having the ability to enjoy nature. Exercising means getting your hear to pound, your body to sweat and me because of endorprimes that ultimately make you feel better. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise. People who support advances in technology say, ""@CAPS3 are able to teach you hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4, coordination is important but your body as a whole should also be put with account as well @PERSON1, voted # @NUM1 cardiologist in world says, ""more and more people are suffering from heart disease & attacks every year!"" be goes on to say, ""many links have been theorized to this on going problem, But none seem to up as well as my theory. I believe peoples lives have been overcome by technology. More and more cases have samt to the people being addicted to their computers. Its unbelieveable but, @CAPS5 individuals have a @PERCENT2 higher chance of developing heart disease!! There are many healthier things you can absorp yourself in. Like tennis for example In tennis you have to develop hand-eye coordination in order to hit the ball. Correctly. Tennis also increase your heart rate & burn fat cells, to help you lose weight. Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis have actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and head healthier , they feel they can can over the world. Isn't this the attitude everyone needs? Nature is all over and helps us are even if @CAPS4 don't notice. Like trees, they take in @NUM4) and release oxygen. Oxygen is key to life. Trees also are home to many living organisms. Like the saumel woodpecker or even owl. They all rely on trees to survive. But, if you are on the @CAPS3 @NUM5' hours a @CAPS1 @DATE1 you @MONTH1 not realize the nature and . Nature is a beautiful thing that over @PERCENT3 of peoploe say they enjoy relaxing outside, listening to birds singing morningsongs or a dear minding their own business feeding with their young watching. But, advances in technology also ruin this time belance of nature. Technology needs a power source, google, for example states to the press that,"" our business surely enjoys nature but needs to also run their corporation"". They go on to say.""we get our energy from oil and coal"" @CAPS5 according, to scientists like boy say that , oil primary source for big corporations. It is for but they don't keep in mind the fact over a million each year because . And ! that deplleats me protection we get from our ozone layer. Speeding the development of climate change. ""without advances in technology we @MONTH1 have a better and safer earth generations to come. Oh sure, says sue sarcastically. But since you texting her you don't know what and ask out her . If not for advances in technology people could make me right decisions. @PERCENT4 of texters say they have miss interpreted others texts. this means bad decisions all accross the world. @PERCENT1 also say have particifated in same of sexting like ther sending peictures a language. Underage children are participating in illegal activity because of advances in technology chief crimes head of the police department in @ORGANIZATION1 says that ever since the invention of the cell phone with the ability to send pictures & text he has need @NUM6 more cases on child pornography. @PERCENT5 of @CAPS5 people are under the age of without me advances of technology for cellphones this wouldn't even be possible for minors. Advances in cellular device has also kept families farmer & farmer apart. @PERCENT6 of parents sya that their children have had me some appreciation & lease that they had before they recieved cell phones. And @PERCENT1 of kids wine have cell phones say they don't think they need their family interaction anymore. Do you believe this is the message to be school to future generations? I thank you for reading this article and I hope you are now experiencing the other side of the debate children need to interact with their families more, enjoy nature and start exercising. This is impossible to do with the advances of technologe."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to recieve new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engenieer, says ""With the technology that we recieve from computers, we are able to be in the game."" @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occured sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flys high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand-eye"" coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most neccessarry aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to manuvor about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point-guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us @NUM4 each. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 comptuers for their society. The stated that it took onlyt @NUM7 months to get the money back that they had purchased on the computer's with the amount that had not purchasing book! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to recieve information instantely from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just @MONTH1 be less in the rest. Dreams of incrediable rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, int the long-run, the decision is yours is make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The creation of computers has greatly effected society. People are now connected to each other around the world. I believe this advancement in technology should be welcomed and embraced. Computers teach valuable skills including hand-eye cordination. People can reach information instantly. Lastly, the speed and quality of communication has increased ten fold. To start off, computers are great tools for learning. Young children learn hand-eye cordination by using the mouse while looking at the screen. Sometimes they learn this skill amazingly well. In the medical field, surgery is no longer done by hand, but with elaborate machines controlled by computers. @PERSON1, a @NUM1 year old student of @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION3, is studing to become a surgen. He is amazing with the computer system, not distancing many professional doctors with the new equipment. ""@CAPS1 is all because,"" scientist who have studied @PERSON1 say, ""he used computers sence he was little. This means he has an advanced sence of how they work and what to do when."" This prodigy was born because of computers.The talent of surgens greatly benefits society because better doctors means healthier people. Computers also benefit the information the internet. ""You have @NUM2 messages in your inbox,"" the window says as @CAPS1 pops onto my screen. I open my email, having not checked @CAPS1 for a day. @CAPS1 is filled to the with messages from @LOCATION4, telling me how far away my order is from my house I have an e-mail from @ORGANIZATION2, an article about the @CAPS2 rover. There is another e-mail from my orchestra teacher, reminding the class that the permission slip is due tommrow. All this would not be possible without computers. In a single second, I can know the headline news in @LOCATION6, or @LOCATION1. I can look at pictures from the @CAPS3 countryside, or a live feed from a submarine at the bottom of the ocean. The research for my social studies project was done in an hour with online rather than stay libray. The computer saves time. This means people have more time to exercise and enjoy nature when the monitor is turned off. Would you rather get in a dark, dark libray all day or enjoy the wonders of the world with a click of your hand, and still be in your own backyard to play outside? Also, people can acess data from around the world. Information on how to cook an @CAPS4 dish is available in @LOCATION5. Along with that, medical records are available every where, meaning all information can be combined to get a bigger picture of what your health issue maybe. Computers also improve the quality of comunication. Statistics show that in moder times, @PERCENT1 of meetings take place on a lap top, not in a board room. With video chatting, all of your partners can appear on a single screen sitting on your lap. You can answer and ask questions face to face from opposite sides of the world. This amazing feat would not be possible without computers. Instant messaging also allows for text to be transfer instantly over vast distances. Documents that would have otherwised been forced to send by mail appear at the speed of light in your inbox. This means instead of important documents taking weeks to appear, @CAPS1 takes seconds allowing the things that need to get done to be finished. Schools can take advantage of this by keeping digital copys of worksheets and other important documents insted of physal paper copies. This means less trees are killed. When trees are cut down, they no longer produce oxygen or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. With meetings taking place on a monitor, people no longer waste fossil fuels trying to get there, sence cars also produce carbon dioxide. Thus, using computers is better for the environment. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people say they prefer sending an email to sending a letter, due to the fact that letter costs money. Computers also alow for more interaction between people. If your father or mother is on a busness trip you can still say goodnight face to face. You can send an e-mail to your sister at college, who never answers her phone due to the time difference. Overall, computers make the world smaller, allowng for better means of communication. Computers are amazing peices of equipment, and I belive, they are a great benifit to society. They teach valuable skills, alow for fast and easy access to information and faster quality communication. Overall, the advancement of computers has benifited, and will benifit society greatly."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write rection on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand-eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about. First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom's friends, They decide to move to @LOCATION2 she didn't like computer so didn't look at @LOCATION2's laws saying, I'll find out when I got there. ""@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn't find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few monthes after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a buetifull country and all of arrests were accidents because she didn't know the laws. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, comptures improve hand-eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at the @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 of these kids that spend time on the compture are weak and need to get some exercise.Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS5, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS5, the people agree with what @PERSON2 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but @CAPS2 you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, @CAPS2 you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because @CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS5, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS5, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever @CAPS2 you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot! From so many students having greater hand-eye cooridination they will enjoy what their good at like tennis. @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Technology helps hand-eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines."" This shows how hand-eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. When a child goes to college they will still be able to email their famlies and talk to them. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact eachother to decuss plans on how to move toward economicly. Lastly, computers are useful and should be useful more. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand-eye coordnation, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. @CAPS2 an article is made to show the pros or computers, more people will experience the wonders of them."
0,"Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1 the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact daily with computer. You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". But do all these & exercise plans really work? According to a study done by the @ORGANIZATION1, the largest cause @ORGANIZATION1 obesity is actually computers! The students at @LOCATION1 had one group @ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they've been doing... Except their computers. They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfotunately, these happens @NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. Teens become in their society lives and become to their computers. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake @ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. Your children are without a doubt, through, the ones a by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sides"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Faced with the concerns @ORGANIZATION1 lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, separation @ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate natural children do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer"" or ""I wish I spent more time"". In the end, the choice is really up to you."
0,There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. Lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries @MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from. They @MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic (stocks). All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. Technology @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye cordination. Hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. This is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life.
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, click, clack that the sound @ORGANIZATION2 computer keys being hit right now. Computers are everywhere these days, even in the poorest places like @LOCATION3.

Computers are our sourse @CAPS5 infromation, and time @CAPS5 liesure these days, but we are fogetting that there is a life away from them as well such as having family time, and taking walks in the beautiful, nature.

Computers can cause many fatal problems such as seeing and vision problems, and obisity, due to the fact that you sit all day and @CAPS2't work out. Computers are like mind, and body eaters the slowly take away from you and let you cry, and weap @CAPS5 the rest @ORGANIZATION2 your life, @CAPS2't you agree? Do you know the @ORGANIZATION2 says that the second biggest leading cause @ORGANIZATION2 obisity is computer? Yes that is true! I have experinced problem. While growing up. When I was @NUM1 I was adictied to the computer. Day and night my eyes were guled to the computer screen. I had nothing on my mind except @CAPS5 computer, my mom got mad at me and yelled at me to get away from it, but I didn't. Slowly, slowly I started to put on heavy, awful faton myself, and later I found out I was over weight @CAPS5 my age. To this day I have not lost the weight I put on from using the computer, and I am sure others are to. Obesity just doesn't happen from eating to much. It also happens from not doing any cardio activities, which the computer stps us from doing. So basically the computer is unhealth. As said by @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 people from the state @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1. Time consuming computers, are taking away family time from many family these days. Do you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 families aren't getting to spend the time with each other as the wish, reason being computers? Kids are on the computer playing games, moms finding a resipe online to make @CAPS5 dinner, and dad is buying another stock online. Yes that happens a lot, insded @ORGANIZATION2 doing those things they could be doing something else, but no computer work is more important. My family used to spend a lot @ORGANIZATION2 time together, but because @ORGANIZATION2 the computer I never get to do anything with my family now. Do you know the time health @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 say kids who spend time with their family are bound to become more better parents than who @CAPS2't spend time with family. I bet you are a really good family man/women and spend time with please take these computers away and make families come together once again. @LOCATION1 has the most beautiful nature ever, the birds, the animals, the @DATE1 times and the fall time. If anyone ever wants to see nature they should come to @LOCATION1, but the sad thing is that the people @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1 aren't appriating nature themselves because they are do busy with things such as computers. I know one time we went to a comp out, and we were ready @CAPS5 nature and this boy brings his computer, and wouldn't you know it the whole got people forgot about nature and played with the boys computer. So many people missed out on the nature and the beautiful animals seen one the such as yellow @CAPS3 through that time was amazing and it is very unfortunet that many people missed out on that event. People these days are once again not apricating nature, which one day they will regret, because @ORGANIZATION2 the fact the one day you @MONTH1 not be around to enjoy this got given @CAPS2't let the computer tell you what to do lets be the boss and @CAPS5 ourself. It is now or never the decision is in your hand, make the right decision and say no to computers. Go out their enjoy nature, spend time with you family, and get healthy. Be the smart, and well educated people. (I know you are) and tell the world to not getting told by the computer @ORGANIZATION2 what you can, and cant do, be the boss control. Yes computers are fun, giving, but is bad. Say no to computers if you @CAPS2't you will regret it."
0,"The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational, the computer is the future plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that, paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances, such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of ""@CAPS2"", people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a @CAPS3. Where would be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows ""good"" websites to be viewed, and ""bad"" on potentially dangerous @CAPS4 to be binded. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites, includes content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminate, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use, and by doing so, better our own lives, and the life of @ORGANIZATION1."
0,"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremly exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. "" @PERSON1 later mentions "" it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be "" beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuests, a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be nessicary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what ""show"" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? Its sadi how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessvive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!"
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer per family has increased greatly in the past @NUM1 years. In that same time people are getting fatter and they need more exercise. If you use the computer it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money. In the past @NUM1 years many people @MONTH1 have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line. Another reason why computers dont give you exerise is because of google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights but if you walk you could burn up to @NUM3 times as much calories then if you just look it up on google. Another reason why computers dont give you exercise is you can get addicted to a game. Lets say that you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00pm. If you go on the computer at @NUM5 then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typeing a way on a computer game that doesnt help you anywere in life. When you dont go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight. Scients say that if you actully play a sport you can lose weight by up to @PERCENT1 then if you didnt. Before there computers life was simpole, no student forgot there homework. But now they use there computer many things can go wrong. First the printer can break. @CAPS1 year my printer stoped working @NUM1 times so I could not do my homework. My teacher said that forgetting my homework affectde my grade by over @PERCENT2. Another reason why handwriting is more convienet is you are capable of doing writing during school @CAPS1 year with my teacher @PERSON1 i had to write a prompt. She told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken. When I got down stairs she told me I had to write it so I got a @NUM7 because she could not read what I wrote. Every other kid got a @NUM8 or above but since I was not use to writing it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvienet is when you need to do research. My parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone I had to reasearch euthonzing dogs on the computer but there was a power outage. I could not do my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science so I got a @NUM9 on it. That grade brought my adverage down form an a+ to an a-. The only reason why I got a bad grade because I depended on the computer for reasearch and it let me down. If I had better hand writing I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason why computers do not benifit society is because they are a waste of money. Most computers caust up to @MONEY1 for the computer and installing. There is no need for them because everything computers have a library can give. The library has books so you can reasearch with books insted of computers. In my house all @NUM7 people in my family has a computer but @NUM11 of the computers are used once a week. They are extreamly expensive and there is no need for them. Also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by @PERCENT3. With that extra @MONEY2 you could buy many books and magisnes insted of a computer. That is why computers are not useful. People are not getting exercise, so the gain @PERCENT1 more weight. It is much less convienent then writing by hand. Finally they are a major waste of money. The decads without computers were much more useful and everyone lived happpier."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, I recently found out that you were diciding if computers had a positive or negative effect on people computers are a big distraction towards, adults and especially adolescents. They also seem to more families grow apart. Lastly, teenagers are more nerablen in getting hurt because of the computer. In my opinion I strongly agree that computers have a negative effect on people. Computers cause s distraction to adults and adolescents. Students in their teenage years spend more and more time on the computer that they do focusing on school. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of students get on the computer the moment they get home. This makes students not want to do their homework but instead procroctinate until a later time The more they put it off the less likely they will do it because they are too busy on they computer. This will cause students to fall behind in school and get bad grades because they aren't doing their homework. Not only student but adults also get highly distracted by the computer instead of doing work or a special project for the company that need to be the computer they on are waiting time online talking to friends. This @MONTH1 pose as a threat to their carrer. If they dont finish that project and it comes to the time where they have to present they will be unprepared. This might make it more likely for them to lose their job, and no one can afford to lose their job in this economic struggle and all because of a computer. Also, @MONTH1 adolescents have chores they must follow and if they are spending too much time on the computer it will never get done if it doesn't get done their parent might ground them or take away a possession. The computer is a huge distraction for all kinds of people. Adolescents as they get older become very independent very fast, and it is mostly because of the computer. They want to spend all their free time playing games or talking to friends that they forget about their family. This causes much tension between families because they are never all together to be able to act like a family. This can hurt teenagers in the long run because when they become older and they begin to have a family they won't know how to act towards them if they also turn out to be a child that is always on the computer the entire time. On the other hand when the adults are on the computer all the time being distracted, their children might feed ignored. If they feel ignored than they might not want to attempt to try to have a relationship if they think all their parents care about is the computer. This will make a huge strain in the family bend. When either part of the family becomes distracted by the computer it can cause fights to break out. If a parent tell their child to get off the computer and they don't listen then it @MONTH1 cause a fight between them. This could turn out to affect the child in a bad way because then they will just want to stay on the computer even though their parent disapproves which @MONTH1 lead to theym getting grounded or punished and only because they got distracted for too long on the computer. Teenagers spend much of their time online talking on websites, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4 which tend to be the biggest distraction it might seem fine at first but if they begin to talk to people they souldn't they become more vulnerable to getting hurt. By having teenagers talk to strangers on these websites they might get lured into a trap and get hurt. If they decide to meet up with a person that they met over the internet and the stranger chooses to hurt them than the adolescents life can be in leopardy. This stranger could be a predator and the teenager won't even know it until the stranger does something to harm them. A simple distraction of the computer could risk the lives of teenagers and eyppse them to danger without even knowing it."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people surveyed in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 agree that the use of computers benefits society. I personally concern with these @NUM1 people, computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple reasons why I think the use of computers really benefits society, including it can teach good hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn abour faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Once again I do believe computers can have a positive effect on people. First of all, its's a proven fact that most sports on physical exercise to involve hand-eye coordination to some extent. The computer can help reach people from a very young age good hand-eye coordination. When a person uses a computer they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard. This takes alot of coordination if you think about why don't even love to look at the mouse on keyboard when they are typing, they just know where everything is. People disagree with what I'm saying often use the excuse that when people spend to much time on the computers they aren't getting enough exercise. However, I believe that is not true. The hand-eye coordiantion people learn on the computer help to improve their skill and coordiantion in sports, for example in baseball a person has to be looking at the ball to catch it, but at the samee time they have to move their arm to catch it. That is were the hand-eye coordiantion helps. This proves that computers can benefit society through teaching people hand-eye coordiantion. In addition to this @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They give people acess to information about a foreign place or people be available in or other resources areas. On the computer one can go to a search sight and type in my place in the whole world. Then all they have to do is search and they have dozens of with information of that place and pictures, @CAPS2 are a society that is advencing in technology people are learnings learn and they can wtih great the of a button. In addition is think it's also a tool in schools. Teachers can have students do projects about different countries on people and the student can easily that the information on the computer. Computer benefit society in the way that they can teach about different loaction and people. Computers can help people become interested in these different topics and @MONTH1 be even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or hack different people. Finally, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people asked had some kind of way to contact with people online, whether it was through email or facebook. Computers allow people to take online with other people. In our modern society it is very important that a person has friends, are great why to keep in with friends, if live very far away from you on it haven't to them in a while connecting them on the computer is a great way to keep i touch. Those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe taht is just the opposite. Since @CAPS2 are living in modern ages families understand that kid leaves to college they might be going far away or even across the country. Having computer allows that family to chat an easy way to keep in contact talk with each other. People talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society. Its now or never! Computers can have benefit society. They reach people hand-eye coordiantion can be use all through our life. Most importantly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Lastly they allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 are living a modern time, society is advancing everyday and computers are a huge part of it! They are having a positive effect on people."
0,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend to much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend to much time on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they @MONTH1 talk with friends with @CAPS4, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant form each other when they sit around on @CAPS5. Teenagers spend too much time on the @CAPS6 going where they should instead of doing more benefitul activities like reading. I sure we all know at least @CAPS1 obese person or teenager. My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as @CAPS1. He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end. Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2 is obese is not exagrated at all. In my opinion, it is the fault of the @CAPS6 and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless @CAPS5 videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand-eye cordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage @CAPS1 to sit around instead of doing standard @NUM1 minutes a day of exercise. The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and @CAPS9 does. I would say that the average gets about @NUM2 minutes of reading a day because they are to busy chating with friends on the @CAPS6. I have a cousin who reads about a book every @NUM3 years and fail every test he gets and has stayed back @NUM4 times, but instead of reading and learning, he is chating and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunitys while their are people in underdevolped countries like @LOCATION3 who are lucky to own a book. I know more than @PERCENT2 of the kids in my class do not read anything execpt the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting @CAPS10 is about @NUM5 and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent. I have seen survey that say @NUM6 out of @NUM7 spend more than @NUM6 hours a day on computers. These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkey who can't even rad. The computers and @CAPS6 are doing more than just erasing brain cell and are health, they are taking away the expriences that we could have outside in nature. Nature holds natural wonders like the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 and the @CAPS13 @CAPS14. What beats sking down a large slope, or climbing the @LOCATION1, certainly not computers. Unfortunatly, that what most @CAPS15 choose to do. They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches. They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens, unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to help the enviorment we are siting on the computers sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen. We should be preserving and learning abouy what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computes and the @CAPS6. I have present a strong arguement against computers that you @MONTH1 listen to or not. I strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent. Set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers. We need to do something now!"
0,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are high tech devises that allow us to connect with friends and family in other places like france or @LOCATION2, allow us to research new information, perhaps for a school project in school project in school and even play addicting games, Computers have moderized our life, and it's affect on human being is dispicable. We have taken these simple devices to far and haven't used them in moderation. Did you know that at least an hour @MONEY1 exercise is needed everyday? Well @CAPS3 from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because @MONEY1 computers. Parents hard earned money is being wasted away on these extremely expensive computers, they can pay anywhere from @NUM1! What a waist @MONEY1 money! @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 kidnappings are caused because @MONEY1 to much information on the internet, do you want that for your child. Computers were once helpful devices that have now turned in to @CAPS4 worping machines. @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the world's @CAPS3 are obese today. Why are they abese you ask? @CAPS3 are growing fast they are meant in be active and playful and without any active sport like dancing nor basketball they are going to grow big. Kid's spend as much a @NUM2 hours a day on a @CAPS2, and not keeping active, @CAPS2 pull kid's in like a magnet. This obsessive @CAPS2 time leaves no time to keep healthy active and fit. I remember one time when one @MONEY1 my friends, @PERSON1 got a new computerShe wouldn't come out and play basketball with us anymore she just stayed inside. Eventually saly became obese and got diabetes. Parents is this what you want for your @CAPS3? Do you want to pay for a machine that makes your @CAPS3 extremley whealthy? Times are tough, money is tight and electronics are expensive. A @CAPS2 can cost anywhere from @MONEY4 TO EVEN @MONEY3 that is a ton @MONEY1 money. Parents work hard hours, for exampe @NUM3 that is a long day and probably dont make enough money to be waisting it on a @CAPS2. An average houshold spends @MONEY2 on computers in a lifetime. Do you really want to be buying your @CAPS3 a machine that costs an outragous amount @MONEY1 money that will only make your @CAPS3 unhealthy and pull them away from their sports? I remember when my mom bught me a new @CAPS2 for @NUM4 dolllars and the next day it broke. What a waist @MONEY1 money. Help your @CAPS3, don't buy a @NUM2,000 dollar @CAPS2, keep your @CAPS3 active and healthy. Make sure your green stays in your wallet. Hey, a small window pops up you screen. Who are you, you respond in an voice, @CAPS7, your freind @CAPS8's friend says the little window. You respond with an @CAPS7 hi, hey you want to come over, it's the cook thing, @CAPS9 ok you respond. What's wrong with this situation? Well a lot @MONEY1 things are but this happens to @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 online chatters. Just remember online you can be whoever you wont to be you could be only ten, but say your @NUM6. So many @CAPS3 are kidnapped because @MONEY1 online chatting. You can talk to your @CAPS3 all. you want but it doesn't mean thy won't be in that situation. The less time your child spends on the @CAPS2 the less chance will have @MONEY1 being kidnapped, The @CAPS2 is so dangerous, would you ever put your child in danger. Computers used to be helpful devices full @MONEY1 information, enjoyment and talks with aunt's uncles, and even your friend @PERSON2. Now these computers have transformed into pursuading boxes full @MONEY1 hamful side affects. Do you want your child feeling the wind in their ears the sound @MONEY1 their heart pumping vigurously and the smell @MONEY1 grass on do you want them to experience the bright screen in their eyes and the thrill @MONEY1 just beating level @NUM7? Do you want to spend @MONEY1 on unhealthy contraptions? and lastly do you want your @CAPS3 put in danger by simply just using a @CAPS2 at home. Computers are @CAPS4 morphing devices that take away @CAPS3's points in life. Do you want thet for them."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very convent pieces of technology but they can be considered a niesence. I recently heard that computers are frowned upon by many people. I strongly agree with this statement I feel this way because computers can cause people to not get up and exercise. Also computers cause you to not talk to someone ""face to face"". Finally, computers have many adviertisments that cause you to invest money. I want you to consider about putting my article into the newspaper so your readers can know how I feel . America has the highest obesity rate in the world. About @NUM1 of @CAPS1 @MONEY1 overweight or obese. That's @MONEY1 out of every three people! I believe that computers are part of this problem. @CAPS3 you are on the computer, you can do anything on the millions of websites the computer, you can do anything on the millions of websites the computer has to offer. You can playgames talk to friends and upload pictures. You can spend hours each day on the computer because you lose track of time. I remember @CAPS3 someting similiar happened to me. I went on the computer and began talking to my friends. Before I know, I had been on the computer for six hours! Instead of going out and exercising. I was on the computer. Thus, computers cause poeple not to exercise. There too busy playing games or updating their status @CAPS2. Another health problem with computers is lack of son. Your body needs sunlight in order to gain . If you stay inside, you will not absorb the sunlight and you will not gain some vitamins and minerals. A local doctor said, ""People who stay inisde on the computer all day, wont get sunlight, This can lead to skin cancer."" @CAPS3 you are talking to friends online; you are not talking to them face to face, you are typing to them. COmputers are bad because they can develop social problems. this someone always ""talks"" to people online vis A.I.M. They would never talk to someone face to face. This can effect someone becuase @CAPS3 they go for a job interview they will have troubles talking the person . That is not the only problem of ""talking"" only. @CAPS3 you are typing to someone, you always your works so it is easier to ypt. SOme example of the are ""lot"", ""ike"", ""k"". This abrevetions can affect your grammer because you are so use to typing those that is why computers cause you to lose face to face time with other people. Did you know that everyday, there are more than @NUM2 viruse?! That is staggering number. This is another baout cokm,puters. @CAPS3 you are surfing thw web at least once, you will get a pop-up that says that you are the @MONEY1 @MONEY1 vistor and claim your prze. These are very dangerous because these @MONEY1 all scams. If you where to click on the pop-up, @MONEY1 of two things will happen. You would either get a virus of they would age for youe credit card number. no matter what you would have a consiquence. A similar situation happened to me. My sister was online and a pop-up came up that she won @MONEY1. What little kid doesn't like money right? So, she click okay and it unlocked a virus on the computer. My mother had to bring it to best to get it fixed and it costed @MONEY2. We were lucky that they didn't ask for a credit card number because they steal my mom's credit card and use it. This is card identy that and the average person who gets their identy stolen, has to pay @MONEY3 to someone. The computer isn't s safe place. I know that you, the newpaper strat, is in a very difficult situation right now. But before you deside, I want you to consider how the will effect us the . they should be informed about new computers can cause problems. Also have it on other now social you are. Finally, they can effect you wallet. thank you and please try to nput this article into your newsaper."
0,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 a teanger growing up in this technologic era @MONEY1 society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. @CAPS1 a well-read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds @MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @NUM1's when they are really a @NUM2 year old working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer @MONTH1 be the quicker or ""easy way @CAPS6 "" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because @MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure @MONEY1 who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide @CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What happend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead @MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to @CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity @MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? Lastly computers can be dangerous and/or harmful to health. The use @MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss @MONEY1 the use @MONEY1 their fingers because @MONEY1 the movement @MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing. Getting rif @MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples' well- being-in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use @MONEY1 computers, there is really not that great @MONEY1 a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerous/harmful to health. Why spend hundreds or @MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks "" @CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @CAPS5?"" because, more than likely there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say ""@CAPS6 with the new ways @MONEY1 doing things technologically in with old ways @MONEY1 doing things manually."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers have become increasingly popular and advanced. So much so that I feel they are intefering with our lives andv having negative effects on the @CAPS4 people @CAPS5 example, many people spend hours on computer when they could be excercising and staying healthy. Another negative effect is how much computers cost, and the financial problems computers brings. Lastly, computers are a huge factor of how families have been spending less & less time together. One way computers effect us is exercise. Many people practically live on their computers and never leave the house. This is a problem, especially with the obesity issue how it is already in @LOCATION1. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS12 spend more time on their computers than exercising. It is not healthy to sit at a computer, ""frying your brain"", (as my mom would say) and not exercising at all. Why not go take a jog, or go to the gym with your friends, @CAPS6, I've chosen backyard football with neighborhood friends over computers many times, and I've been happy with that choice. I beleive that computers are effecting how much exercise we got and not in a positive way. If everyone ditched computers @CAPS5 a little while and exercised a little more, we'd be closer to erasing our countries tttle of the.""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 in the @CAPS9."" @CAPS10 the negative effect computers have on excercise is a major issue, it is not the only one. Another huge issue is their effect on money and financial problems. New technology is cool, but it comes with a price (literally), Technology, especially computers, is getting more experience almost by the day. Computers are ridiculously expensive, and it is starting to have an effect on the people wallets. Many people feel the need to have the bigger and better things, such as new computers. Some people buy a new computers model when it comes out just to say they have it. Who has hundreds of @MONEY1 to spend in the blink of an eye to buy a new computers which also supply you with even more bills. You need to pay @CAPS5 repair bills, @CAPS11 my computer broke and my dad had to spend close to @MONEY1 trying to fix it. And many people have computer in their house. This could let to financial problems and here are better things to spend money as such as healthy fresh foods that our body deserves. Computers have also started to limit the amount of family time that @CAPS12 are getting. Several families almost never speak to one another because they are to buried in their computers. One good example of this was on the @ORGANIZATION1 show. @ORGANIZATION1 had a family on @CAPS13 that was totally anti-social with one another. The mother would make dinner, and the other family members would just grab it and take it whenever to eat. The dad went to his office to do work on his laptop, the son went to his room to use the computers, and the daughter did the same. The mother was left alone, either to use a computer or to sit & eat by herself. This is a great example of how computer can and are effecting the amount of family time @CAPS4 families are having. With computers taking over their lives many families now spend little or no time with their family. There are so many other things to do, like to take a family bike ride, take a road trip, make a family craft, or even play a board game or learn to cook. The only way to get better families is to closer, and computers are restricting the amount of family time families are recieving. Now I hope you see the negative effects computers are having on @LOCATION1. lack of exercise, wasted money and minimal family time are only a few problems. If we didn't have computers, these problems would go away. @CAPS10 computers do have some benefits, it would be better in the long run @CAPS5 them to disapear. That is my opinion."
0,"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought @CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, @CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like @CAPS8 was home again. @CAPS8 ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids @CAPS15 a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""@CAPS10 night i had @CAPS11 homework. I had vocals @CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up @CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing @CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, @CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in @CAPS11."" @CAPS15 her computer, @PERSON6 would have to have and @CAPS11 @NUM2. @CAPS8 would have just kept failing @CAPS15 her time-saving computer. ALso, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computer allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertabrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @CAPS15 his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. Obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does @CAPS13 allow people to learn about places other than their home, @CAPS13 also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people, think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. Tere is video-chatting, e-mail and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web-chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as @CAPS2, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to @STATE1 and had to leave all my friends behind, the computers has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can e-mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on @CAPS2. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to @LOCATION1, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said. ""Computers just make @CAPS6 all of the information I need to knew about your brother's diabetes so easy."" @CAPS6 information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made @CAPS6 information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stayin touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that needed, and they make our school lives aint easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!"
0,"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too."
0,"To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room. Get outside go for a road trip save life humanity your fellow niebor your family."
0,"Dear @CAPS1-in-@CAPS2, More and more people today are using computers. They are making our lives better and easier, giving us a lifestyle that our ancestors couldn't of dreamed of. Computers make our world a better place. The society of mankind has always been social one. We @CAPS4 human beings have the need to be around and know about our friends and family. With computers, this has become drastically simpler and easier. Facebook, founded by @NUM1 years old @PERSON2 for the students of @ORGANIZATION1, is a site that allows not only communications, but true connection. A recent article in the @ORGANIZATION2 stated that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION2 had a facebook account. This is an incredible amount of people and because of this, not only kids but adults can connect with old friends that they don't know about. You never know, that third grade friend of your's might be the newest billionare. Let's say you did connect with an old friend on facebook, how would you communicate? With another invention that has changed our world forever, @CAPS3. Why send that message via ""snail mail"" when you easily have it sent and recieved in minutes. @PERSON1, a small buisness owner, recently stated, ""@CAPS3 allows met to connect with my customers, I can talk to them and get feed back on my products."" @CAPS4 you can see, @CAPS3 has helped @PERSON3 tremendously, @CAPS4 it does the rest of the world, even kids. But if your young, you might want something even better and faster than @CAPS3. What is this, you ask? Kids today can connect with each other over instant messaging, more commonly known @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @PERCENT2 of kids between the ages of @NUM2 and @NUM1 talk to each other over istant messaging. This allows them to chat and communicate, a proven thing to help kids develop socially, according to the medical examiner through all those advances computers help us to ""get connected"". For a moment, lets forget social networking, and get to something a touch more serious, buisness. The world revolves around money and buisness, just look around you. Most buisness run on computers, all of their records and information is all in computers. Remember those days when you would ""punch in"" a time card, well not anymore. These days you would swipe your key card through a scanner. Not only small buisnesses, but the biggest buisnes in the world is run by computers. The stock market is managed and dictated through computers. In fact, @PERCENT3 of investors buy their stocks online, on sites such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. And where do people get this money? It all comes from the banks. Online, people can manage their accounts or see if they can afford that @ORGANIZATION2 car. If you look at it mathmatically. According to the transition property. If computers run buisnesses in the world, the computers in the world. Through all of this, people need to know things. And the easiest way to do that is online. You can even get your daily news online, almost @PERCENT4 of news companies have websites, so you can check out the weather in @LOCATION3, or what just happened in the olympics. It is possible to go to @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION2.com and check out what is going on the world. Its not only news thats online, it's everything. Through search engine such @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION4, one can find anything and everyone. Rose of the hospital for special surgery stated, ""I was about to perform surgery on a young man. I noticed a small if the bone marrow, so I googled it and saw it was a prelude to cancer"" This @ORGANIZATION4 result @MONTH1 men's life! We can also look back in history, @PERCENT5 of history is online, and anyone can access it. Through these advances, we have made human smarter. Computers have changed our world, we a the technology age an ages I am happy to be a part of. Computers make a world a better place."
0,"Advances in technology would have a positive affect on people. Think about it, computers could help hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and allow people to talk to other people online. Computers would most definetly be a positive affect on people. As mentioned, computers would help hand eye coordination. This is very important when playing a sport. Baseball for instince players need to catch a ball that is trying at them they need to be able to catch it. same when hitting. Computers would teach people to have hand eye coordination and they would want to go outside and play, which also is good exercise. Think about this with computers kids would instead of being home doing nothing be outside playing a sport just because they were on a computer. Dont you think computers are a good idea? Also a computer would help kids get better at typeing. This is not only good now but when they grow up and get used if that job is being a consultant for a company they will have to do alot of typing. If the person is not good at typing then they probably will get tired. If the person had a computer then when they grow up they will be a better typer and not get tired. Do you really want to see someone not get u job just because there were no computers? Computers help people succed in the life and its is all do to computers. Besides, hand eye coordination, computers give people the ability to learn about farway paces and people. The computer gives people the ability to serf the web to find out cool and interesting details about places that they would be able to unless they had a computer, The computer would give the person a whole sheet or more of details about the place or even a person. I remember last year I was wondering what does my country I was born in look like? I looked on the web and sure enough it gave me a whole buntch of pictures and details about my country. I would have never been able to find that with a book. Also the computer helps with school. The teacher might assigned a paper and has have to use a computer to find the information. If has don't have a computer then you just that assignment. The computer helps students get work done in there house and not in a library. Computer help in many ways but if helps learn which is one of the most things. Finally, the computer gives you an opportunity to chat to people online. Some people have friends that they dont know number and so when they go online and chat with them they get the number. Without to computer they would have never gotten the number. Also maybe you havent talked to someone in a longtime and now with online chat you can. In maybe you cant talk about something but you can write in type in the computer can let you with one of your best friends and then you can tell them and feel much better about yourself then it all in, computer is one cool machine and not only will it let you surf the web but it. Will give a chance to chat online with one of your best friends. To sum up, computers are a sofisticated machine but would have a positive affect people. They help people with hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk to each other online. The computer at first might seem like a bad idea but if young think positive it will turnout positive. The computer would most defitely affect the people in a good way. In any case like this is there? Really a bad side to having a computer?"
0,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families,but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. on average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence."
0,"Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people."
0,"Dear editor, Have you ever would to know something so badly that you can't focus on anything else? Have you ever tried to find that information and had an""ah-hah!"" moment? What did you use to search for this knowledge? You probably used a computer. All you need to do is type in your request, hit "" enter"" and viola! Your screen fills with choices of information sites. Computers help so many people with everyday questions. Our country has gotten smarter because of computers. You can converse with friends that have moved across the state, country, or even world. At every click of your mouse there are new things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to lake. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to florida. I was devastaded. At first, we tried writing letters to each ohter. Then, as we grew older and became busier and busier, or connection with each other halted. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long-lost. You can also meet new people with one of the many sites available. How would you like to talk with someone all the way down in @LOCATION2? World communication has also opened up many business opportunities. Since the economy is failing, computers will open job spaces, help college students study for their futur career, and hopefully help to improve the lives of many people. Communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to came. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your. Any game you can think can probably be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitare to an advanced level of shift, games for any age and difficulty level can be found. New, some people @MONTH1 think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some peole that will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends or just read outside. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't help it. What we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun. The computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed. @ORGANIZATION1, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever wait to know from the vice president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to how wide the @LOCATION1 is can all be found with the click of a button. this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly. Most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently, you have all the facts all the time. I think our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long-lost friend in @LOCATION2 or talk to an expert on osprey in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in @DATE1. Have fun and learn lots!"
0,"Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are effecting the lives of many people. More and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life. People should be exercising, and hanging out with friends and family, computers dont even teach you that much if you really think about it. People don't even realize that computers can take away very important things in life. Fore istance, people aren't getting nearly as much exercise as they need. In this generation, more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation. People get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. Computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything. People already spend way to much time watching t.v. It rots your brain and studies acually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. Computers are the same as t.v.'s, you say that your just going to be an for a minute and then next thing you know @NUM1 hours have already gone by. Computers @MONTH1 be exercising your brain, but they're not exercing you and that's what really counts. Even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. Most people don't have the time to run out to the library to get the books that they need, so they just resort to the computer. That isn't the smartest idea because half of the websites that you click on or go to don't even have the correct information. You might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. Next thing you know, you have a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 on an assignment that the thought you aced. On top of getting false information, most people don't even know where to look to get the information that they're looking for. People just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter. Then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page. Then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were. People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. If people just went to the library and did research the old fashion way, then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on. People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. Sure you can talk to people on the computer but you can't bond with them or really see what they are feeling. It's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. Even if your spending time with your family or friends you're probebly thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there, so go out and do something for change, a little fresh air wouldn't kill you. You should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. People don't realize it, but after spending so much time with your family, rather than your computer, you will acually notice what you have been missing out on for so long. As you can see, computers aren't helping anyone. It's either not exercing, getting false information, or not spending time with your own family! Seems to me that having computers around isn't everything that it's cracked up to be."
0,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, the iTouch, and the iPad are all examples of the latest in technology, specifically from @ORGANIZATION2. Such technology can have many effects on people, both good and bad. But, our society @MONTH1 be too caught up in today's advancements. Computers have a negative effect on people. There are many reasons that support this opinion. First, the screens take time away from friends and family. They can also effect one's performance in school and prevent people from getting the exercise they need. @CAPS8, computers can negatively effect people. To begin, computers have a negative effect on people because they take time away from friends and family. For example, I got a new laptop for @CAPS2. I loved it so much that I spent all of my time on it. Usually after spending too hours on @CAPS3, and @PERSON1, he had to tell me to get off. He was angry with me for this. Another example is when my family scheduled to go see a movie together. The movie was called The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and was supposed to be astonishing. But, I didn't want to go because I was too busy watching television on @CAPS3. My computer was too addicting to leave to spend time with my family. Also, there was one instance when my family had gone over to anothers house. My friends and I went straight to the computer playing on @LOCATION1 and losing the thoughts of playing @CAPS7 or exploring the woods. Their mother had to scold us and say ""This is a computer-free playdate. Get off."" @CAPS8, these examples show that computers can take time away from the people that matter most to us. Another reason why computers have a negative affect on people is because of school work. For example, my sister is in fourth grade, so she doesn't have much homework. But even an hour's worth of math and writing frustrates her so she goes on @PERSON1 @PERSON1 instead of completing it. She spends at least half of an hour playing on the site until my mom tells her to finish her work. Another example is how I used to watch @CAPS9 shows on my laptop at night rather than getting sleep. I watched at least two @CAPS10 Family episodes in bed after my family had all said good-night. I wasted about an hour of valuable sleep on my computer, making myself really exhausted at school the next day. Another example of how computers have a negative effect on school is how it changed my reading habits. Since I learned to read, I have been putting aside @NUM1 minutes to an hour of reading each day. I would read before I went to bed at night. But now, I spend time on my laptop. I have lost my love of reading to computers. @CAPS8, they have negative effects on people. A final example of why computers have a negative effect is because of the noticable lack of exercise. For instance, one out of three children in @LOCATION2 are overweight or obese. This is partly due to the fact that nobody goes outside to play like they used to; they play on the computer instead. Also, I want to begin to exercise as well. But, I find that playing on the computer is more enjoyable than push-ups and sit-ups. My dad additionally is affected as opposed to going on a bike ride, he goes on @CAPS11. Computers obviously have a negative effect on people's exercise habits. People must decide their opinion on computers now or never. Computers have a negative effect on people. I have traded my love for reading and school for computers. People are trading exercise for computers. They are trading family and friends for computers. We must decide bad act now in order to save society from getting lost in the world of computers."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS1 has come to @CAPS2 attention that certain members of our society believe that computers are not beneficial. This position comes from lack judgement and a closed mind. Computers are lifelines to buisness workers who use them to complete all of their work, these tools also enable news of disaster or weather to spread efficiently and effectively. These technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends. In todays society computers are vital and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, being accompanied by multiple severe consequences. First and foremost, about @PERCENT1 of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. These works of art aren't just handy-dandy toys , rather @CAPS5 essential to the working class @CAPS5 a # @NUM1 pencil to a student taking a cut. @PERSON3, an owner of a small buisness, agrees. ""@CAPS2 company designs software and uses computers @NUM2. Many of @CAPS2 employees work from home and have to own computers."" The growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. By ripping our computers from lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences. Adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consists of computers. Nowadays students' homework is mostly online, computers decrease the amout of time needed to write an essay and are glare to students of all ages, @PERSON4, an eighth grades at @ORGANIZATION1, is an example of this dilema. Every night she has at least three hours of homework and usually one hour be @CAPS1 requires a computer, however, this isn't a problem because @CAPS1 cuts back the time @CAPS1 takes for @PERSON4 to do her homework. She can quickly type up an @CAPS3 essay or research a science topic instead of doing @CAPS1 painstakingly slow using an old fashion method. Moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of @LOCATION1. Whether some people like to believe @CAPS1 or not, @LOCATION1 is a bit of a sicludded area where people aren't aware of what is going on outside of their closed off town. Computers cause news to spread like electricity and open @LOCATION1 residents eyes to national and global problems @PERSON2, another student at @ORGANIZATION5, states, "" @CAPS4 the earthquake took place in @LOCATION3 @CAPS2 friends and I were all at lunch, @CAPS5 we came back to class @CAPS2 teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the white board"" @CAPS6 computers were taken away a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children. Most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. Families can connect with each other no matter @CAPS6 they have cell phone reception or what area of the world they are in, @PERSON1 is a senior at @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION1 who agrees. ""@CAPS4 I go to college next year I am going all the way to @LOCATION2 and want to be able to talk to @CAPS2 family, via email and instant message I can contact them even @CAPS6 its inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away."" @PERSON1 brings up a good point computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep @PERCENT2 of healthy relationships, @CAPS5 shows a study at @ORGANIZATION4. In conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. The are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. Computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the @ORGANIZATION2, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a possitive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happend to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. Thiss guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity if has had on society but @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computers. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2, on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show thas @PERCENT3 of families have waste their college money in computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1 do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children at."
0,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you keep in touch and @CAPS1 do computers effect your job? Some people are using computer to often and arent able to enjoy the outside. World. Some use computers for other things then to some times just waste time. I believe with computers having a strong a positive affect on people. You can keep in touch, you can learn, and you can have fun with computers. Computers have a big role in our society, and I know you'll have the right decision on whether or not computers are used to much. You can keep in touch. Not only can you keep in touch with relatives, but also people in different countries, or states, and even people like your friends who live next door. E-mail is a great and healthy way to communicate with others. There are also other websites like facebook and skype were you can actually post pictures up about yourself and family and be protected. @CAPS3 if you live miles and miles away you can easily show your friends the things you've been doing or your new baby boy. @CAPS4 also shows things about your personal info. You can make friends with people and plan @CAPS1 your going to hang out this weeked. Yesterday my @CAPS2 emailed me a picture of a cub bear in a tree outside of his cabin he was playing in, in for. He's over @NUM1 hours away and I can still email him back saying, ""@CAPS2, did you make a friend."" With in seconds he can respond saying, ""I even got a bear hug =)!"" @CAPS3 I talk to him while he's away and were almost together. I bet you use email as much as we do to get a of printers and. @CAPS4's a fast and easy way to communicate. You can learn.. Computers are a very big part in the learning experience. Teachers, students, parents, and grandparents learn everyday with computers. There are educational websites to learn about things. In our school yesterday on ""quiz.com."" @CAPS4's a website for schools were you can take quiz instead of paper. If your a busy parent, with kids, you can work online. You can get payed for the work you do with, websites, and. You can also go to school online. There are people are very busy and dont have time to go to college classes can take classes. They can learn and even interact with. The computers teach you they dont hurt you. Everything. Security, jobs, bills, school, contacting, games, everything. Most people, schools, catch their buisnesses with out a computer. Computers protects you and help you grow. You can have fun with computers. A lot of people go online and play games on numerous websites. These game can past time and the player some fun. @CAPS4 might not be running but its fun. You can do @CAPS3 many things on the computer to have fun. You can play online games, download music, skype, browse, shop,, and even meet people. Meeting people is a big thing. A lot of people these days are using. way to meet and interact with new and interesting people. My cousin is now @NUM2 and he used online dating and met this really sweet and pretty girl that lived nearby. @NUM3 years later they're maried and are more in love than imagined. See @CAPS3 love can be found out on computers and a lot of fun too. You have read my reasons and you have realized what the computer does for the world. Most everyone owns a computer and almost everyone needs one. This an easy way to communicate or keep in touch, you can learn from, and you can have fun with the computer. Many more things that are in good use. I have now convinced you that computers are very positive for people."
0,"Recently, there has been debate about whether or not computers benefit society. Although each side has its own reasons, computers do have a positive effect on people and on society. Computers are beneficial in several ways. With the use of computers, you have the ability to research and learn about foreign and local places you are able to communicate with others and the help people complete everyday tasks. At one point in everyone's lives, you need to know about local or even foreign places. It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about. This is where computers come in. Over the internet, you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in @LOCATION3 all the way to the day the new year in @LOCATION1. You learn about things in the comfort of your home, or of your home town. I rember once in @NUM1 grade I had to do a research project on @LOCATION2. By going on the computer, I learned all I needed to know and they some. The project was a breeze, and I got a perfect score. Also, you can learn about local upcoming events, and about the world around you. During childhood, every kid has many questions, some their parents might not be able to answer. Using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers. Computers help educate the minds of people and without them, we might not know anything. Communicating with people on the other side of the world is difficult. Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipiant. Computers provide us with a imediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away. Last year, my uncle moved to @LOCATION3 for work. I never got to see him.We communicated with each other over computers, and when he came home for christmas, we were as close to each other as we were before he work. Computers kept our relationship healthy and I do not think it would have been that way without them. Scientists say that about @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 have communicated with someone at least once through computers. They also say that @PERCENT2 of these people regurally use this method of communicating. Although we still use phones and ""shall mail"", I do not believe that our society would be able to function socially without the availiable use of computers. Everyday, computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems. People get things done quicker, giving people more time to do what matters most, interacting with their families. Without computers, everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life. @PERSON1, my neighboor, said ""@CAPS2 and banking are so time consuming. I do not know that I would be able to handle it without the ability to do my banking online."" In addition to takes and hancing, computers help with everything from shopping to woking for the perfect phone company to use for your new business. Having the ability to shop and browse online takes away ariving, walking and checkout line time letting you relax and take your time throughout the rest of your day. Typing also gives you hand-eye coordination without it, you wouldn't be able to do everyday things such as opening the door to playing sports outside with your children using computers helps people get through their lives easier and more efficiently, I could not even imagine life without them. Computers benefit the people of society in every possible way. By helping them obtain knowleage, purifying and strengthening relationships through constant communication ability, and helping make their everyday lives easier, they have a purely positive effect on people everywhere. Computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people believe that computers are one of the best pieces of technology in this world today. However, computers can actually be much more of a nuisance than people realize. Computers do serve their purpose and they are very useful, but computers take the place of too @CAPS3 important things. Computers have such a negative effect on people, which is destroying our society. Computers have this bad effect on people because this technology takes time away from people exercising, people rely to much on computers, and it takes time away from interacting with family and friends. Have you ever wondered why @LOCATION1 is sometimes referred to as fat? Well, this is because citizens of this country don't spend enough time exercising, and spend too much time on the computer. The average persons is on the computer for at least an hour a day. According to health statiticians, a person should get at least an hour of exercise a day. The time that is spent on the computer could be used for exercise. Now @CAPS4 you're really ""glued"" to the computer, you can still use it while exercising. For example, while my dad is using the treadmill, he watches television series on the computer. So. being on the computer for a long time is not an excuse for not exercising. Unfortunately, way too @CAPS3 people don't believe this, which is part of the reason why computers have such a negative effect on people. @CAPS3 parents of children who go to school agree that students rely too much on computers. This is very true. When students get home, they go on the internet to find the answer to their home work. Instead of ""surfing"" the web, these children could easily walk to the library and get an encyclopedia or dictionary to find the answers. @NUM1 times out of @NUM2, you can find answers better in a book than online. In addition, kids always rely on things like e-mail to stayin touch with each other. Whatever happened to calling someone, or mailing a letter to them? It can be guareenteed that @CAPS4 the internet across the world was shutdown for even just a day, kids would go insane. This has a negative effect on the human mind because people don't know how to work hard anymore because everything is on a computer. now, why should our society be destroyed by just a little piece of technology? How @CAPS3 people get to interact with friends and family on a daily basis? The answer is: not too @CAPS3 @CAPS4 people would take some time a way from computer, they could interact with family and friends. Instead of contacting there people through a computer, it would be much better to actually see them in person. Furthermore, instead of playing game on the computer, you could invite some friends over your house to have a friendly game of cards. The kids have fun, and get to interact with each other @CAPS5, instead of e-mailing your family, family, you could have dinner with them somewhere. It gives everyone a chance to catch up on things. Plus, @CAPS3 people seem to have a better time when they can verbally interact with each other, rather than through a computer. @CAPS4 computers didn't take the place of family and friends interacting, maybe this technology wouldn't have a bad effect. In conclusion, it is clear that computers have a negative effect on people. First of all, computers take time away from people exercising. Secondly, people rely too heavily on computers. Last, computers take time a way from people interacting with family and friends. Think about it. Computers are having bad effects on people, and we don't even realize it. @CAPS4 we are supposedly such a strong country, how can we let the simple computer slowly destroy our society?"
0,"Over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 citizens have at least one computer in their homes. Recently, however, people have become concrened with the effects that these modern machines are having on people. However, over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 citizens with computers, state that they find computers to be extremely beanificialy to not only themsleves, but to the enitre world. Not only do computers allow people to educate themselves on foreign places, but they also provide a way for people to interact with others, and are a more efficient way to complete both work and school assignments, quicker, learning more time to play with friends and exercise. Clearly, if computers were effecting the population in negative ways, they would not be as popular as they are. Picture @PERSON1, he is a @NUM1 old man who has always been interested in the traditions of @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS3 people. One mornign @PERSON1 wakes up and decides that he finally will go to @LOCATION1, the land of his dreams, only he does not know when to go. He climbs out of bet and shuffles over to his @CAPS4 book pro computer, and opens the web braser. In a matter of seconds he has discovered that more are many traditional festivals ion @DATE1, and the weathe is good. He also knows where some traditonal parties will be held and what type of clothes to pack. without his comuter, it would have taken @PERSON1 hours to find all of that information. Computers greatle help people nlearn about far away places. You can access news in seconds and be reading on article about the @NUM2 earthquake in @LOCATION4, because your @CAPS5 could have loaded a news atetion. Computers allow us to educate ourselves on worldly matters more efficeintly. You could learn about the war in @LOCATION5 and about the tsunami waves in the @LOCATION2 at the same time, and since computers are world wide the information is most likel as acurate as it gets. People across, not just the country, but the world use computers, which makes inetraction with friends and family @NUM3 times easier. Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 teenagers say that tehy use computers to talk to either their friends who live near by or their second cousin who lives halfway around the world. Interaction tough computers is spreading like wild fire, across the globe amd with all of iots new features, why wouldn't it be. Showing of your new puppy playing in the snow on facebook of working out project do takin a chatroom on instant messaging have become what nearly @PERCENT4 of the world do on a daily basis. Communication can be anything from sending an email to video chatting on skype. It is all possible and time efficint with computers. Many say taht computers are the csuse of the spreading of obesity, whereas they consume time taht should be for fun, healthy activities, however, this is not the case, it is really the opposite, actually. Computers one a way to accomplish necesary work at a more effint speed. Writing a @NUM4 word if hnd written, hower can tak as little as @NUM5 minutes when typed in a word processing, application. not only us time a factor in this, but going acuracy of work. If an assignment is typed, you can both spell check and edit the document handing it in. While the work increases, the time does the opposed allowing more children and adults to get and play ourside. Infact, it cuts down your consumption of time by nearly @PERCENT5! Computers are a positive influence on the population of @LOCATION3, as well as the world. They provide simple access to information, encourage social interaction and even cut down time indoors allowing people to be active. Clearly the population positively benefits from these magnificent machines, I doubt we, as a natio, could function without them!"
0,"How would you like to got a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after-school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 posibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didnt know what to do, so i online and spend only watching youtube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non-sense. Computers can and make you. I honestly never seen someone on the computer for."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 have been many debates on wheather computers have a good or bad effect on people, but if you think about if computers have a great effect on people! computers give people even more ways to communicate with friends and family, they give you the chance to enjoy nature and enjoy faraway places. Finally computers teach hand-eye coordination! Video chatting, iming, audio chatting ect. These are jsut some of the many ways that computers give you a boost up in comunicating with your family and friends, while still enjoying @CAPS1 face, or voice! Video chatting is on many or most of the laptops, and desktops that people own. Video chatting lets you, and a friend/ faimly member to talk to each other by the computer while seeing and hearing them. Its a great way to communicate with people that don't live so close to you. IMing is when two or more people can instant messaging each other. This is handy for when you don't want to call someone but just have a quick question to ask a friend. Audio chatting is who a phone call but on you computer. So if your ever without a phone you can go on your computer and call someone, using the phonebook thats also on your computer! These are alleasy free ways to communicate with your friends, and family when they are not always right @CAPS1 to talk to of to hangout with. With computers you can bring the nature indoors! With our technology word getting so big its easy for people to own laptop. With laptops you can go every where and still be able to go on the computer! So you could go out to the beautiful park sit down and go on your computer enjoing nature and using the computer. If you wanted to go on vacation to the @CAPS2 you would go on your computer and book your trip. This way you would use a computer to get a vacation to the wondered outdoors! While your at the @CAPS2 you would probably want to take lots of pictures of all the amazing things you see, so then what do you do if you want to show all this amazing pictures to your family just upload the pics on to your ocmputer and email them to as many people as you want all around the world! So with computers you really can bring the nature to you! Even though you @MONTH1 not believe this computers teach hand eye coordination. This can help and translate the many other activities that people do. One example is driving. without hand eye coordination you would be in a real pickle leave you need to control the wheel and look where your going so its good that computers double your skill. Another time that hand eye coordination comes in handy is when you are in school. Writing inuctes moving you pencil and loading where you are writing is you didn't have really good then you would have very messy handwritingand would not succed much in school because no one conviced you even use in eating! because you have to look where your forth is going bring it back up to your mouth! if we did not have computers to benefit then we would be very shock. If you ever hear your mon say to you get off the computer!"" tell her why your not going to, and then thats see what she says back! computers learn hand eye coordination, they bring hte nature to you, and they give you many more ways to contact and talk to your friends and family. These all give a much more positive affect on your social network, and adventure! So if you think computers are ruining our generation think again they acatuly make it better! "
0,"Where would be we be wihtout computers? There would be a had time communicating for a lot of people, the is used to do homework and business and it also allow you to learn about things and places you have seen before. So, obviously computers have apositive effect on people because of the communication they allow, the help they give students and workers and lastly the knowledge they can give about pretty much anything. I know of a lot of people who have trouble commicating with family members and I see that it hurt them. Without computers these people would have even less communication with the people they can't see on a daily or even monthly basis. My friends lives in @LOCATION3 and only comes to @LOCATION2 for special occasions like holiday's and my friend doesn't have a phone so he can't call his dad to talk to him. The only communication that he has with his dad is video cahtting and without that his dad would have no part in his life. Clearly computers have a positive effect on human's when it comes to communicating, but it doesn't stop there, it also is used for kids and adults to do school more and business. As a studnet I know that I wouldn't be bale to get @PERCENT1 of my homewrok done if it for the computer, so it really comes in handy, as for writing adults, I know always see my dad a from because that is where he wroks and it is a lot of fun and as a part of working at home my dad has to do all of his work on his laptop. If my dad didn't have his laptop then everyday he would to you to @LOCATION1 and I probably wouldn't see him until dinner time. So, the computer has played a very positive role in my life far. I believe taht it will keep playing and important role in my life, for the rest of my life because I am going to have to be more organized and get more information which is what the computer helps you to do. Not only does the computer allow communication and work to be done, but it also gives fun facts and allow you to learn about crazy places or people. Everybody likes to do more than work on the computer, one places like @CAPS1, or @ORGANIZATION1 that allows you to learn about things you've never even heard about. Speaking of @CAPS1 it can let meet @LOCATION1 peopel or learn @LOCATION1 things about people. you already know. So it really allows you to have a big social life. A lot of people go on vactions to places they've never been before so before they go they might go to a website about that place so they can learn about the attraction and what to do when they go ther. Also, I go to sports websoyes like @ORGANIZATION3 sports or @ORGANIZATION2 to learn about all the sports news and the scores that happened in the games. It is a good reliable source that is a good way for people to know what happened if they misses a game. any data can be found if you look hand enough on the computer. So, clearly computers give a positive effect on people for the of, that they allow people to communicate when it is tough for them to see each other, gets work more for students and business people, and last but not least it is a good source of fun facts and knowledge, you might need down the road. People really enjoy computers and therefore you can see they put a positive effect on all peopel that use them, so whoever says they don't has probablly never used one. Thank you for reading my opinion."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer benefits society due to the possitive affect on people. Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1. I was working on a long history paper and @CAPS1 essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, @CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. In history, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge of this hunger, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @NUM1 hours. Research has proven that @NUM2 children in countries of africa die a day from malnurutousment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume. Thus through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my . Do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @LOCATION4 as well as @CAPS2 they have recently traveled to. Also @PERCENT1 as the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 and staying in contact with my fr iends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online, with other people the use of computers benefits society. Through the internet, people can learn about @LOCATION2 places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computer."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer. Our access to such a large network beings us together, can broaden mental horisons and keep many @CAPS5 hard workers on key point so that when time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms. Our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build sley scraping towers, educational fucilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run, they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls. Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help chane opperators maintain their skills during their of season vistually. It @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectation. To one it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a persition to such a task. Pull the lever to quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction causing it to tip over. One of feild reponters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders. That just goes to show that @CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site. I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy going to a class outside & school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly. The internet provides an efficient low casting, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language. In @DATE1's society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home canbe just as afective, but that can awkward for those that don't particulary do well in face to face setting. However, havbing a complete at hand can make learning an enjoyabl experience. Once can find blog posts about someone's visti to there country of interest & even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for and acception vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well. Some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives. Social networks on the web makes connecting with lvoe ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean. I hope that everything I have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill maintenance tool, educational, and as a connection for our foreign born citizens. Thank you for"
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, Are you tired of technology? Are you concerned about your loved one using the computer to much? If you answered yes to all these questions, then you to agree that computers do not benefit the society. In my opinion computers have a bad effect on people because more people are spend time on the computer than they do exercising. Also, @LOCATION1 has such breathtaking nature but no one takes the time out to enjoy it. Besides this, the effect of the computer has even effected interaction with ones family and friends. So now if you please read on I will be happy to tell you more about how computer effect people. Have you ever wondered @CAPS3 so many people travel to @LOCATION1 each year? The government states that every year at least @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who are traveling to @LOCATION1 came to mostly see @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 nature. But the sad story is that @CAPS4 @CAPS2 rather sit at home on the computer than than enjoy the magnificint nature that @LOCATION1 has to offer. You might be wondering how I know that @CAPS4 immagrants come to @LOCATION1 to see nature. Well, my uncle from @LOCATION2 wanted to come from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. I asked him @CAPS3 he came and he said, ""@CAPS3 I wanted to come enjoy the nature here."" @CAPS4 people though just like to sit at home on the computer. This technology has made people really lazy. A recent study shows that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that were nature lovers now traded there hiking sticks for computers. Now this isn't good at all and shows hwo computer affect people. @PERCENT1 of people that exercised daily are now saying that they rather spend time on the computer than excercise. Now people have become so busy with the computer that they say they don't have enough time for excercising. For example, people can now do anything on the computer from watching movies to playing games. This has caused people to forget about the world around them. Besides that, if people dont excercise and spend their time on the computer the obesity rate might go up. Even @PERSON1 says ""that the obesity rates are starting to rise as more and more people start to use the computer. For example every time a person eats they need to do some type of physical motion before sitting down. But peopel that use the computer are now just eating and sitting right back down so they can use the computer. Now this is mad if you ask me. Yes I know the computers helpful but it also is helping make sure people dont excersise. Isn't spending time with your family and friends important? A research study shows that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 @CAPS2 have stoped interacting with friends & family since the computer came out. For example many people have stopped going shopping with there friends because they can now shop online. This makes people even more lazier because now they can things online so they dont even have to get up. Yes over though this is easier it also makes many people less interactive. Besides this, many parents are setting bad example to their children and teens. Our furture workers are now starting to use the computer and became less interactive as well! This isn't good at all, and this reason @CAPS3 comperters effect people. As you have read you can tell that computers do have an effect on people. In my oinion computers are bad because people spend less time excercising and more time on the computer. So now stop what your doing and on stop these computers that one taking over over nation as we know it. We need to go stop the bad effect that computers have on people"
0,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would life effect you if you did not have a computer? I strongly belive that computers have a great effect on people all around the world. It helps you at work for a job and at school. Computers also help students and adults talk to people. Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can find out all of that information. Read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school. Just think, without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong. Work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says, on the computer, you work is always going to be neat. You mcan e-mail your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if. you need to change something for a paper, it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not effect me in a horrible way because it helps 'me get my work done faster. Computers help people communicate with other people. By having a computer people can talk to other people. In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong. I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on facebook and if they are on, talk to them about what they wanted to do kthat night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that. You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place, you want to go, you will see if they easy way to get there and that might not he by car. i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching. Now I can just go on the website and find out 'everything I wanted to know about that place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I would not want to travel that far so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like. i use the computer for mostly everything I do. Comming through our minds have showed you what we have thought about the effects computers have on us today. We can make work a lot easier, talk to other ;people, and get imformation on places you want to visit somebody. The computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this."
0,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there @CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it let's people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it let's family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks/changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updates on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you @MONTH1 ask? Emails don't recquire paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness. Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effect on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did."
0,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 not advance in technology?"" asks four year old @PERSON2. There are countless reasons, people are spending way too much time on the technology we have already such as the computer. @CAPS9 of wasting time on this device, people arent excersicing, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with their friends and family. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? According to a study done at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the best colleges in the world, you're only burning @NUM1 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer so that's @NUM4 calories. Even if they did aerobic excersize for the rest of the day, they couldn't burn enough calories @CAPS9 you can only burn @NUM5 calories an hour at the average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they became obese, if they are obese they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! @PERCENT2 of the obese population in the @LOCATION4 die from a heart attack. With out a doubt, computers are like poison, if you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use to much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. If you are in @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 who have actually seen something like this with your own eyes you're lucky. ""@CAPS3 fellow @CAPS2, I painfully state this fact. The rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being cutdown as we speak. This is @CAPS9 the @CAPS5 never go out and smell fresh air & see how beautiful the rainforest really is. We must stop them!"" pleads former @CAPS6 @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speach. Too bad only @NUM6 out of every @NUM7 @CAPS2 could relate to kid message. @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 have never gone out into nature. @CAPS9 of this, people are saying who cares about nature & the rain forest? ""@CAPS9 of this, the rainforest is mercilessly being destroyed and animals are loosing their homes. When a pool was given to the @PERCENT3 of people who don't ever go outside to ejoy nature @PERCENT1 of them responded that it was @CAPS9 they are too busy spending time on the computer. The computer is a monster - it's killing our planet."" I love @CAPS3 mommy. I @CAPS10 her everyday before dinner,"" sadly states eight year old, @PERSON1. Using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones, even if you are communicating with them on the computer. A @NUM5 year old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3 was on his death bed what he wished that he could change about his life, he answerd, ""I wish that I didn't use the computers as much I got to know @CAPS3 family & friends better! @ORGANIZATION3 died lates that day. Do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death? No, you don't. In a drug rehab the @ORGANIZATION4 asked the patients @CAPS1 they started drugs in the first in the first place, @PERCENT4 answered that it was @CAPS9 they didn't feel love by their families. After they answered, they were asked @CAPS1 they didn't feel love, @PERCENT5 of them answered @CAPS9 the people that they love were to busy on the computers. Unless you want to put one of your love ones' in the hospital do not use the computers. Obviously, computers are aweful technological devices. Yes, they do help with coordination, but would you rather be fast, not enjoy family & nature, but be able to catch a ball or be healthy, loved, and loving?"""
0,"Dear Newspaper, Computers! Computers! Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and excirsising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not whats truely important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Polution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people, because now these computers are brain washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Their the more, computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any excirsive, which is a health issue we need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have! Consiquently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This @MONTH1 be old fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the @ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time, writing on paper is like writing it in you brain. Therefore, students, children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and resonsibly. @PERSON1 is an english teacher that has been with the @ORGANIZATION1 school since before computers, she has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right befor her eyes. @PERSON1 told me, ""@CAPS1, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reativeness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time. Last, but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively. Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers. These fancey computers are very expensive, but also very useless. In my opinion many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers effect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all there money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very usefull,but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are."
0,"To the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1: I think that computers have a positive effect on people and it is an advance in technology. The computer is a new technology that can be very useful for education purposes. Computers can also be used to connect with family and friends, and the computer can have useful games that can help us. The computer definitely has positive effects on people. for school and any other educational purposes, the computer can be very useful for @CAPS2. Computers can help @CAPS2 with their homework or projects with a click of a button. They can research about any topic online and use that information if they don't have time to go to the library. The computer also has @ORGANIZATION2, a program that is often used at home, offices, and even in school. With this program, @CAPS2 can type up their paper and just print to have a neat copy that they can turn in. Teachers also think that the computer can be very useful when it comes in education. In a survey, @PERCENT1 of teachers use the @CAPS1 or any other program on the computer to try and learn a lesson. More and more teachers are discovering educational websites and programs that can help @CAPS2 learn a subject. @CAPS2 also take a liking to that subject when they find that they can interact with the subject online. It can make the subject more enjoyable for the @CAPS2 to learn, and for the teachers to teach. Computers will always be on the aide of education. People can also use the computer to interact with friends and family online. Family you don't see for years can be reconnected with you through video chatting or instant messaging. You can also reconnect with people who live far away. Through websites like @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION3, people can talk to their friends and family more easily. @PERCENT2 of teenagers would rather talk to their friends through the computer than talking to their friends through the telephone. It is more enjoyable to see your friend while talking to them if you are videochatting. That is what you can use the webcam for. many people have the webcam and they use it for connecting with friends and family. It is a great way to be social and branch out to your peers. You can also use the @CAPS1 to meet new people and learn about others who you have never met before. Computers are a great way to connect with friends and family and be social. Computers can also be very useful for @CAPS4, groups, and committees that are trying to reach out to the other people. As the @ORGANIZATION1, a widely known newspaper I'm sure you have a website that readers can log onto and learn more about your newspaper @CAPS4 use the @CAPS1 to create websites that can inform buyers, partners, or other people who want to find out more about their business. And through the @CAPS1, they can also advertise their business if they wish. It is very useful and can earn you a lot of money by attracting customers to buy your products. Groups like the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 can use the @CAPS1 to inform citizens of what they are trying to get people to support and to acknowledge the awareness of the importance of that group. They can use the @CAPS1 to gather supporters and expand their group. @CAPS4, groups and committees will use the computer to lure in customers and supporters which will earn them much money. The computer can be useful for many different reasons and it will always be advancing our new technology of the day. Whether used for educational purposes, social purposes, or business purposes, the computer has a positive effect on people."
0,"Dear local newspaper, The effects computers have on people is not exeptable. The effect make it bad for people. Also, the effect of computer bad for children and kids. The computer could also lead to not healthy body. There for the effect of computer on people isn't great. First, many effect on peolefrom computer is bad for them. The computer make people go blind and that really bad. If everyone goes blind then know will we discover new things and cook food. Another reason is that going blind could waste a lot of money for glasses and there about @NUM1! Many family can't afford glasses that make their children can't see! Another way computer has bad effect on people is that their body isn't right. Most people who uses computer everyday and don't excersie are fat. This is bad for your health. For example, I have a grandma who stays on bed and watch @CAPS1 every day. This is like usingthe computer. It turn out that her blood pressure was high since she don't move. It causes her to have stroke and now she in a nursing home. As we can see this could happen to people who uses computer everytime of their lives. Another way it bad for your body is because will spend less time with family number. Spending less time with family will make relationship of one another just break apart. For example, I have a dad who always go to friend house and newer spend time with me and my sis. So my dad and I don't really get along. So that why using computer bad for your health. Therefore, computer is bad for everyone. Next computer effect one bad for little kids. There bad because now website has ad that show someone naked or something not appropriate. As the parents can see this is bad for children who don't know anything nad start talking aobut it in school. Also sometimes computer show bad word and soon those kids who see it will learn the word and start to swear. A memory I had is that one day I was on the ocmputer and saw bad word and ever a lady in a bikini. As you can see I was very affonded by sseeing that. I was confused, another reason computer effect kids i because lots of the website give flase information aobut website a child went on to search sometimes it should give a child a incorrect information. One day I wnent on wikipedia and search panda. It said that the panda was blue. And we know it not right but the children don't know that. There, computer have a bad effect on children. Last but not least, computer effect is ad for people health. For example, I have a friend who eat junk food, while on the ocmputer doing something everyday. this was bad for her health. It turn out she had to go to the doctor for eating to much junk, see!! The computer mader has not exercise reusing her to be in a unhealthy situation. Also, most people would sit and look at the computer. This is bad for everyone blood pressure. Expecially when we eating and sitting. This could cause all of have high colesteo. another reason istant no one will excercise making you body fat and won't decrease fat cell. As we can see it bad for everyone health. Therefore, computer is bad for you. In conclusion, computer effect are bad for people and should be step. Since, it not good for everybody by not talking to family. Also computer effect is bad for little kid, since the bad ad. And last it always bad for your health. Thus, people should only use computer if needed."
0,"Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 and all loyal readers, @CAPS4, you are in the big city. You walk down a once bustiling street, but it is now empty and deserted. The only person you see stares straight at the ground as he walks by, as if he is afraid to interact with you. You walk into a nearby shop. The only person in the shop is an obese lady. She is sitting in the corner on her @CAPS5. Not effected by your presence. The smell of junk food and sugar fill you nostrils and the enjoying clicking of the keyboard fills you ears. With the growing use of computers, people are not exercising as much, not enjoying nature, and not interacting with other people. Computers definiatly have negative effect on our society. First, to many people are spending too much time on the @CAPS5 and not enough time getting exercise. Sitting at the @CAPS5 all day will just increase the amount of obese people in the world. The amount of obese people is already high, but it is growing at an astonishing rate, due to the over abundance of @CAPS5 usage. A study by the medical department at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that the number of obese people in the @LOCATION1 is increasing by @PERCENT1 every year, this study also @LOCATION1 that computers are the #@NUM1 cause. It is simply not healthy to sit at the @CAPS5 all day. On top of that, it is a fact that when you are sitting at the @CAPS5, you are more prone to over eating. For example, @TIME1 I was playing a game on the @CAPS5, I look out a jumpo bag of chips. I was playing and eating at the same time. Before I knew it, the chips were gone. It was almost as though I didnt know I was eating it I though computers are great pieces of technology, the health problems they cause make it not worth it. Would you want this unhealthy fate for yourself? Next, when you are sitting at the @CAPS5 all day, you are not able to enjoy nature. It is a fact that our bodys need fresh air to function properly. @PERSON1, specializing in the effects computers have on our bodys, wrote in his book, @CAPS5 @CAPS6,  In order for our bodys to be healthy, they need fresh air and the outside sunlight. Computers are preventing use from getting this. Have you ever been sitting at your @CAPS5 and got a massive headache? Well, people that spend over @NUM2 hours a day straring at the @CAPS5 are more licky to have chronic headaches and eye problems. In fact, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that they are more than @NUM3 times more likely would you want to have serious diseases just because you sat at the @CAPS5 to much? Finally, when people spend to much time on the @CAPS5, they are notable to interact with others. It is a fact that this will create a rude, innositerite way. I once went to my friends house. She was too busy on her @CAPS5 to even say hello to me! Computers just dont create the skills neccisary to be nice and friendly to others. Would you want this fate for you and your children? Now, @CAPS4 that same world I described in the beginning ecept without computers. You walk down the street and people greet you and say hello. You see people smiling and laughing, smell fruit and vegetables and you hear laughters. Though we live in a world ruled by technology, its not to late to change. We can live! Our lives healthy excercising, enjoying nature interacting with others. So fellow readers of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, stop using the @CAPS5 and live you life!"
0,"Dear Newspaper, I'm sure you use computers a lot, typing up your articles. Many people in this world now use computers. There are people that work on computers sit on the @CAPS2 all day as their job. You can find so many things on the internet & @CAPS2 I think computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact, helps the environment and people, and helps remember things. First, computers now are very important and useful. There is always so many kinds of websites that you can meet you date or catch up with you family members. There is many people using facebook and myspace. Now you can instant message them to talk to them @CAPS1, you can find old friends or people in college. Secondly, some people might say oh, @CAPS8 you're on the @CAPS2 you have no social skills but you @CAPS6 you type and talk to people. You even improve your writing skills. @CAPS5, it helps with hand eye coordination. There are many people that has no hand eye coordination like me. When you look at the screen you have to move you hand to get the mouse where you want it. Computers @CAPS1 help you type faster @CAPS8 you type a lot you get practice, just talking to a friends you even improve. These are my reasons why I think computers help our society in interaction. Secondly, @CAPS2 now have everything you can think of from buying food at @CAPS3 & @CAPS4 to textbooks, all you have to @CAPS6 is search it on goodle and there it is. @CAPS8 more people use the textbooks online, than printing @NUM1 page books will @CAPS3. This means it will help the environment. People @CAPS3 cutting down trees because more people are using online books that means animals will keep their home. Secondly, you might think computers give radition, well more & more computers are trying to fix that, to help your heath so its not a danger to be on computers @CAPS5, @CAPS8 more people are buying and using computers they will need more jobs to help build them and sell them. Right now there are alot of people without jobs. So @CAPS8 you keep computers popular there will be a lor more jobs. These are my reason why computers are good for the environment % people. @CAPS5, people can remember things @CAPS8 they have really good memory. For me, I don't have good memory. And i know a lot of people that don't as well. Well that's where computers come handy. There is a button you press on mac computers and it pulls up a ""TO @CAPS6"" @CAPS7 and you can just type in whatever it will be there so you won't have to miss place the paper. Secondly, @CAPS8 you have a @NUM2 page essay you wrote on paper put it in your binder the holes can break and the paper is lot. Then when the teacher ask you where it is you have no clue, @CAPS8 you typed it you can go back in saved files and print it out. You have it. The good things is you get an A not a @CAPS9! @CAPS5, computers you can set something where it tells you every hour to @CAPS6 something. So while your on the @CAPS2 it will say one hour pasted and you can go @CAPS6 whatever you needed to @CAPS6 every hour these are my reason why computers help you remember things. As you can see, there is a lot of positive things when you buy a @CAPS2. There are many people that use computers are a positive effect on the society because you can interact helps the environment & people and helps to remember things."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A resent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negitive affects on the society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finaly you can chat with others. I belive computers can only benifit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassels of life. With computers you are able to plan your life with @CAPS1 output. This program ables you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when time is done to that event. With this program you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer you are able to gather information at extreamly high speeds. Supose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars, you just enter cars on @ORGANIZATION3 and get millions of results. this save much time than going on the librery and finding a book. This can take up to on how . Finally, with a couputer handy there are programs for special needs people to wright. New programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 word have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who can not wright because of blindness or a disability speek to the computer what he or she wants to wright. In an istant it will pop up on the screen. Computer ease peples' lifes jarasticly. Besides esing lifes, computers teach you about far away places and people. pictures on a computer give one a first hand acount of how a far away place is like. Insead of just reading about it you can see it. Acording to time magazine if a person sees a place they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first hand acount of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and, pores, and events that are in the far of place. For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers you can talk to people around the world. you can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can esily do so with video chat. Not ownly can you talk to someone you can see them. i remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I mised my friends in @LOCATION2 so i video chted them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a bussness meating around the world with out having to traval out of your town. For example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3 they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money of travaling. Also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, video chated many people in @LOCATION4 to undersand now bad conditions were after earth quake. You can talk to people with ease with an computer availible. In conclusion, I believe computer are benifical to a society. They ease life, teach people about far away places and the people who live there, and alow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help the society a great deal."
0,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that manypeople are not benefiting fromusing computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As i mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people whouse computers too much are overweight. That is an extremly high statistic! By computers affecting this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be over weight. If these people aren't getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer. If peopole are getting addicted to the computer they @MONTH1 start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes @MONTH1 not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you @MONTH1 know, getting freshair is good for everyone. Its always nice to smell the nice @DATE1 air after being in school all day. Many people dont do this because as soon as they get home its to the computer. These people are losi a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed @PERSON1 she told me that, ""many people don't get to see what's on in the world because of computers."" They never take that to look at anything thats going on around them. By keeping updated. You never know what topic @MONTH1 pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home i have and by helping these animals you're saving life. Many people dont have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is hat by being on the computer you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be innoying to have to do but you're helping your family and thats all you can do. Also, if you are a parent that has children they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say ""hello"" to anyone. I find this extremly rude. I just hope that family members don't get offened by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers. By using computers people don't have enough exercise, aren't enjoying nature, and spend less time with family. Thank you for reading my opinion."
0,"Most adults beileve that computers are just awaist of time and are somtimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well its true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future. So the next time you log on to your comptuer do some of these things and turst me your will think exactly what I think."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe computers are having a negitive effect on people all around the world. People spend too much of their time on computers and its ending up ruining their lifes. People are spending more time at a computer rather than exercising or spending time with their familys and friends. Cyber-bulling and online predators are major internet threts that inocent people encounter everyday because of too much computer time. Computers are ruining good peoples lives perminitly. Computers really have a negitive effect on people. Take my friend @PERSON5, for example, she was a star athlete in lacrosse and hockey and was always active in some way. However, when @PERSON5 recieved her first laptop last year, it slowly began to take over her life. Instead of going outside to practice, she @CAPS3 sit home on her couch and surf the web. She ended up quitting all of her sports and staying home on the computer day. She started leading a very unhealthy lifestyle and got classified as obese this past winter. This is a very sad story and it really does show how a computer can and will negitivly effect your life. @PERSON1, a very well-known doctor, was recently quoted saying, ""Computers are the downfall of our generation. They ruin lifes and too healthy people into lazy people. I cant tell you how many kids I've seen become obese because of too much computer time and not enough exersise. It's so sad."" @CAPS3 you want to end up like my friend @PERSON5 or the thousands of other obese americans because of a computer? Computers can also negitivly effect peoples personally lives. Take my cousin @PERSON3, she the most girl in school who loved hanging out with friends and family members. However, when she get to high school she started using the computer more and more. She soon seemed as if were out with her friends, her grades segnificantly dropped and she stopped talking to her family. Her whole life was overtaken by the computer and it completly changed her as a person. It's so hard to watch this happen to someone you love. But you should know that @PERSON3 was not the only one who this happened to over @NUM1 american have been completly taken over by the computer. Scientist @PERSON5 recently conducted an experiement with computer usage and got some sheering results. He said, ""People become like addicts with the computer and they just cant get off"". @CAPS3 you want to see you or someone you knows life get ruined because of something so silly such as a computer? Lastly, computers can effect people but exposing them to cyber-bulling and online predators. My dearest friend came was just like any other middle school girl in the country and like most people she had a facebook one day an older high school girl started bullying @PERSON4 online to the point where @PERSON4 fell into depression. One day she decided it was too much and took her own life. Her family and all of her friends, including myself, were so disterbed an heartbroken over the whole situation. As you can see, cyber-bulling is a real danger and can potentially be life thretning. A recent study showed that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 kids admitt to have taken part in cyber-bulling before @PERSON2, a detective said that @PERCENT1 of teenage suiside is due to cyber-bulling. Do you really want to be exposed to theese serious dangers? All in all, computers can seriously effect you in a very bad way. They slowly start to ruin your life and make you loose the great person you used to be. I think computers are very bad for you and people should stop using them."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 many people have been arguin over whether or not computers are good. I think computers are a great invention that help many people. With computers people can stay in touch, learn new things and even helps them with research. A major portion of people who have computers chat with others online, via the internet or e-mail. People can send each other messages or pictures in just a few seconds. However, if you wanted to mail these things it could take days and more money. Also, if you lived in another country the prices for mailing to another country can go way up. Luckily, with computers you can chat with people all over the world without having to pay extra. Finally, people can chat quickly over instant messagig and even through webcams. ""Computers are a great way to stay in touch,"" says @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 for kids. ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids @NUM1 use computers to chat."" I think that is a vast amount of people. My second reason on why I think computers are good, is they help you learn a variety of topics. If you go on the internet you will notice every major company has a website and @CAPS2 @PERCENT2 of privately owned businesses have a website to. Some of these websites can teach you how to cook, build, etc. Then you can also look up events in history and get at least @NUM2 for major events. The internet can give websites that teach you new things you might never learn in a school room because few people knew about it. Finally, they can give step by step instructions for many fun activities to learn. Instead of buying a cookbook you can go on-line and seach for recipes. This brings me to my next reason. My third and final reason on why I think computers are a marvelous thing to have is they help with research computers might cost money at first but the will save you a lot of time and money on the long run. They can type up reports instead of you having to take a pen or pencil and have your arm ache, until it feels like it is about to fall off. Typing makes it much easier especialyy when you are doing research. It is like double tasking. Instead of spending money on cookbooks, encyclopedia, dictionaries etc, you can use you @ORGANIZATION1. You can look up definitions in less than @NUM3 seconds and type it down if you need it for research. That serves a lot of time instead of looking for a writing utensil and paper, then flipping through a @NUM4 pages looking for just one word. If you're looking to do some cooking, type in a recipe that you want to try in the search bar and then in a few seconds there will be thousands of choices. Finally, if you need to write a report on something in history or animal or anything don't go looking through encyclopedias. Get on your @ORGANIZATION1 and look up whatever you need on the internet. In a moment you'll have all the details you need and can start typing away. In conclusion, I think computers are an important think to have. Not just because you can play video games on them, but they keep people in touch, teach new things and help you with research. I think I proved a point to the people who think computers are bad because they kep people from interacting with family and friends aor keeps them from excercising or enjoying nature. However, on the @ORGANIZATION1 it helps you with all of these things and I hope that you agree with me ."
0,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to."
0,"Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They arent communicating with any of their friends, and arent really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didnt have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the worlds discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. Childrens specialist @PERSON3 says, @CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports. @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. We wouldnt want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didnt have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people dont have computers & cant communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they dont talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. The same family as before is sitting in bright, sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, hey, look at his  and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!"
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 since the day it was invented, the computer has been regarded as a piece of technology that can help us. Over the years, companies and people have modified and improved computers to the point that they can fit in the palm of your hand. We rely on the computers and in return, they do our work efficiently. However, some people are concerned that computers could be bad for us. I'm not one of those people. After all, is there anything wrong with increasing hand-eye coordination, learn about whatever you want, and talk to anyone online all at the single click of your mouse? I used to get ot a @DATE1 camp, where I boarded at a college and took courses for three weeks. In this time, I met plenty of friends. As you can probably tell, by the end of the three weeks, I had to say goodbye-but not before collecting all of their @CAPS3 adresses! @CAPS2 friends came from all over the world. For example, @CAPS2 roommate came from @LOCATION1, and @CAPS2 classmate came all the way from @LOCATION2! Computers, in this case, became @CAPS2 means of communication. I could send all @CAPS2 friends an @CAPS3, and they would recieve it in less than a minute ( much faster, compared to ""snail mail"" which took a few days to receive. @CAPS2 computer allowed me to stay in touch with all of @CAPS2 friends, with-out the costly phone bills, or slow delivery time, @CAPS3 helps almost everybody-from the business people discussing urgent matters, all the way down to people like me, who are just trying to talk to their friends. However, emailing isn't the only good thing about computers! Have you @CAPS1 been assigned a school project on something rediculous that you don't know, like the element of @ORGANIZATION2, or how to build an engine? No matter what topic you're assigned, the internet will have an answer, or at least a theory. A big advantage of having a computer is the fact that there are expansive search engines, such as google or yahoo. Because the internet is unlimited, you can find your answer online, whether it's from the online scientific dictionary, or a nobel prize winner's bestselling book-which is very convenient. By doing so, you literally have access to all of the knowledge in the world. @PERCENT1 of people who use their computer have better hand-eye coordination than those who don't use a computer, according to a recent research experiment. Hand-eye coordination is an @CAPS4 part of our lives. Without it, we wouldn't be able to pick up something, or do most functions with our hand! From these statistics, it's clear that there's a strong positive correlation between using the computer and hand-eye coordination. After all, how else would @PERCENT1 @PERCENT1 of computer users have better hand-eye coordination than people who don't use computers. Because hand-eye coordination is such an important part of our daily routines, I'd say that it's safe to assume that computers benefit society, as well as ourselves. As you can probably tell, computers have improved our world in so many ways. With the invention of super-fast processing computers, we're able to do things even quicker than before. From gathering information, to improving hand-eye coordination, then to communication, I think that we should be able to agree that computers, @CAPS5 not @CAPS4 to the physical needs of the human race, are a wonderful invention that should be cherished, seeing as they greatly help and benefit our society, even up to today! *- @CAPS5 books @MONTH1 hold the same information, it's much easier to find it online rather than skim through a myriad of pages to get your answer."
0,"Dear @CAPS1's Newspaper, I'm @NUM1 year old student of @ORGANIZATION1. Today I will tell you about it a good idea or bad idea for people who using computer a lot. Well my opinion is I agree for people using computer any time they want, because I think in a good for them. My reasons are help they learned about teach or computer, it really helpful for who first time come @LOCATION2, and it will help some people got no lonely felling anymore. I will explain those reason next. First reason was help they learned about teach or computer. Well on you know when you grow up, you get a job to do @CAPS3, then you really need computer to help you. Because some job you don't need computer and some some job you have to. Learn how to type fast on key board, it very helpful when you get a job. Let say you have job, your job is about taxing on computer and you have @NUM2 min to be done tax paper. Get what you don't know how to type faster, you suning out of time, and you getting fired. Becasue you don' t spent long time on computer to learn how to type fast. If you know how to type fast you will doing find. Second reason was it really helpful for who first time came to @LOCATION2. This reason it my favorite one, I will tell you about it. @CAPS3 far you readed my letter, there it a lot spelling wrong and bad written because my @CAPS2 not very well, @CAPS3, by the way, when I first time come to @LOCATION2, I really don't speak @CAPS2 much. After that I went to @ORGANIZATION2, my teacher told me to go to computer to learn @CAPS2. @CAPS3 far, I learn how to speak @CAPS2 and write. Because I spent some more time in computer and @CAPS7 @CAPS3 it really help me. When I know how to speak @CAPS2 more better, I told my dad to go to computer and enjoy this program, it very helpful and it fund. Latter on, he know how to speak @CAPS2, just a little. Wow, I can't imagine that computer is very helpful for me and my family. Third reason was it help someone got no lonely felling no more. My @DATE1 I was in @NUM3 grade and I has been sent to @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS10. It my favorite @ORGANIZATION2, you know why because my birthday was @NUM4, @NUM5. I was @NUM5 year old when I came to that @ORGANIZATION2 and I'm in @NUM7 grade. I got some friends in there that I really don't want to miss them. Those friends are @CAPS11 @PERSON2, @PERSON1 and some more I forgot their name. They are my best friend and they are in my band class. @CAPS3 right now I live in @LOCATION1 and they live in @ORGANIZATION3. It very fall away to talk each other @CAPS3 I fell lonely. Then I find out @CAPS12 email on computer. Wow, I was kinna happy to get @CAPS12 email, because right now I can talk to them and I can see their face. Some of them really miss me and I miss them to. In the conclusion I hope you understand what I am talking about. @CAPS3 my reason are help they learn about teach or computer, it really helpful for who first time come to @LOCATION2, and help soemone got no lonely felling anymore. My reason already told you why it good for many people who spent more time on computer. But I think some time people really need careful to use computer, because who know it bad stuff on the computer. "
0,"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy natire like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize? Well that's the problem you don't get any exersize. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count! A recent survay has been conduched and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @PERCENT2 are over-weight or indanger of being over-weight. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day-lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a facinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, ""but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. The most important thing in life is family and friends, technology should @CAPS3 get in the way of that. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? Loving family and friends of course! If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4-@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exersize, spend more time in Nature, and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 used in moderation,I think computers can be a amazing and source of entertainment, education and communication. With advancements in technology everyday, our society grows and learns even more without computers, I find that I would be lost. Luckily thogh, I was a @NUM1's kid and blessed with technology. As people's lives begin to grow more and more hetic, there's less time for people to do what they really want. I know this is the situation in my life; I'll wake up early in the @TIME1, scuttle to school for seven hours, and stay after for two more hours I come home from school at @TIME2, and suddenly, it's bedtime for me. Like many other people, I like to watch @CAPS2, but with my hetic schedule and lack of a our, I can't watch shows that i've been dying to see all week, like @ORGANIZATION1 or lost. With websites like @LOCATION5 though, I can shows that provide entertainment for me. @LOCATION5, streams episodes of @CAPS2 shows on it's website, allowing for millions of people to watch it, who wouldn't be able to otherwise. Also, as another source of entertainment, people have played games on the computer for a while now. The provide a fun way to pass the time and you can be happy, while you do. A very popular game currently to @LOCATION1, on @CAPS4. Many of my classmates play this game, and I can hear them chattering about it, in the halls, with more computer advancements, more ways of entertainment @DATE1 up everyday. Whenever I have a research project do, I jump straight to the computer. Why? Because I know it's a never ending source for information, unlike @NUM2 years ago, research is now much simpler to do, I'm currently doing a research on the oppression of women by the cultures that they wear. By using the computer, I've gathered usually information about tightlacing cassets and binding in the song dynasty. The computer allows for a faster, more convient way to expand your knowledge on any subject. If you need directions to a place, you can @ORGANIZATION2 it. Or, if you need to know the capital of @LOCATION2, you can @ORGANIZATION4 it. The computer also allows an faster way to access news. Within minutes, I can find out about the latest breaking news. I remember going onto @ORGANIZATION5's website to find headlines about a typhoon making windfall in @LOCATION3, where my best friend was for the @DATE2. But with my computer, I was able to find out it had not struck any damage in @LOCATION4, where she was. For me, the computer is a wonderful source of information. With my sister in the @CAPS5 currently it's hard to get a hold of and see how she's doing, I worry about her, being alone in a different country, with no one to code after her. But with the program @CAPS6 I can easily video chat with her erasing all my questions of her well being. @CAPS4 is also a popular social networking site, which allows people to reconnect with old friends. My aunt uses it to find her old high school and college friends that she misses. Also, with websites like match.com and @ORGANIZATION3, adults can find people, that have mutual interests as they do. With advancing technology, the computer continues to be a link between people. In my opinion, there's no better invention that the computer. It allows us to achieve things, we never thought possible. It allows both ourselves and society to grow as one. learning every step of the way. Technology has blessed us, and we take advantage of the oppurtunities that a computer gives us"
0,"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers possitively affecting society? As technology advances, humans are relying on them more and more; most people use them daily. I believe computers effect people possitively because they help write papers, are a social tool, and are a big help with research. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a possitive effect on people in society. My first reason why computers have a possitive effect on people is they help with writing papers. Whether it is writing a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand. Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect; it is a pain to write each draft by hand. In additio, it is easier to read someone's writing @CAPS1 its typed, especially @CAPS1 the writer has hand writing. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. My second reason why computers passitively effect people is by being a social tool. Many websites online these days have social networks such as youtube, facebook, twitter, and myspace. In the listed websites above and many others as well, people can meet other people through other friends and games. The nice thing about meeting them online is that you don't have to plan a time to meet the person, @CAPS1 you are both online you guys can begin chatting. The chatting also helps @CAPS1 people have long-distance relationships, whether friends, mates, or family. Online chatting help people stay in-touch with someone they might not see everyday. That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping then us ""the "" @CAPS2, online sites like eharmony or match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family. This helps people live happier lives, another possitive effect. Finally, computers possitively effect people by making research much easier. My dad always says ""You kids got it easy. @CAPS1 I was growing up, we'd to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" @CAPS3, its simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. Libraries might not have the most recent books, or someone might've checked out your topic's book. Then what can you do? The internet is also an extremely useful help @CAPS1 the research topic is very specific, if its a certain becteria or species that a book @MONTH1 only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research, taking less time to understand, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. To conclude, computers have a possitive effect on society, because they help write papers, they are a social tool, and are a big help with research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites. What about how hours of research are @CAPS3 two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should appreciate all the do for us."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People all around the world use computers everyday. I believe that computers have very good effects on people all over the world. One positive affect that computers have very good effects on people all over the world. One positive affect that computers have on people is that we are able to learn a great deal of information of topics that we never knew existed. Another good effect is that people are able to interact with other people around the world. The lost good effects that computers have an people in that we are able to research objects that we @MONTH1 purchase in the near futer and buy it online. People, everyday use computers to learn about topics that they know existed. To this day, I have had multiple projects due for history, @CAPS3, and almost every other subject. If I did not have acess to a computer I would not have done nearly do well as I have. I am working on a project in history class about @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, The I chase was @PERSON1, or great secretary of stud and military leader, there aren't many books in our library about him so I go straight to the computer. The computer always have information on any topic or object last week I look a survey, and over @PERCENT1 of all the students in my school use the computer and internet for either there homework or projects. That is one reason how computers have a positive affect on people and children. Using the computer can also help you interact with friends, family or even people you don't knew and would like to meet. Almost @PERCENT2 of all adults over the age of @NUM1 have @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. On those webistes you are able, in meet new people and talk to your friends. I have a @CAPS8 account and it is good people meet new people and become more with their lives. I have more provids on my account and I can talk to them all the them. The by if for example that are still while we in the @LOCATION1. My mother keeps with our relatives in @LOCATION2 by @CAPS8 on its tiny are still with us. That is my secon computer people everyday. Computers are for buy in the . Using this you are not money because you can as much time and the object. Last your for my birthday I on that as in @CAPS9 car and I got over @NUM2 million hits. I reasearched the cars and round the one the suited me and was not less expensive. I believe that researching objects can save you time and many. For example, if you go to a store and the store does not have the item then you just lost aproxiounetely @NUM3 hours. You @MONTH1 also waste money becasue if you just search the object you want, then you are able to see where the lowest price is. The computer can save a tirp to a store by just ordering your item right from the internet. My mother always busy my shoes and her paper online because she does not have the time to go shop for one. That is my last reason why computers really do have a positive affect on people. Now you how why computers have a positive affect on peoples lives everyday. Computers help students leanr about topics for school, they help people interact with other people and save you time and money while shopping for items. I strongly suggest that you agree with my arguement, computers affect and help everyone with their lives. P.S. strongly recomend you agree with my argument."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and kids of any age at this society, are way to focused on the latest technology. One piece of equptment that is affecting peoples lives, is the computer. We need to get rid of this habbit and learn to do different activites! People are spending way to much time on computers and less time enjoying nature excersing, and need to interact with friends and family more take the time to agree with me as I confront you on how the computer is taking over our lives! Is time flying you by? Are you overwhelmed, at how life passes you so quickley? Well, if you answered yes, stop the computer madness and head on outside! Your no enjoying nature! Nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 love oceans with pink sand. Who would want to miss this? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house. Just think you won't be able to see the stupendous, the seasons changing, withought going outdoors. ""I want my @CAPS6, to experience the wide variety of nature as she grows old."" @CAPS5 of her daughter. Well, @MONTH1 I add, little @CAPS6 is not going to get much nature out of her, if she does not get her eyes unglued to the comuter screen! Yes, comuters, are very brilliant, and have lots to do, but if you want to be missing out on the new trees being discovered every day, be my guest! @PERCENT2 of all the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to technology brought into our world. The greatest impart is the computer! high-paid physicians try and teach their parents at a young age, to go out and play sports - while excersing at the same time and nor to stay home and play videogames. Now you tell me, would you rather get a good healthy excersise, and have all the energy you need or would you like to slowy add on to your and gain issues as you the internet? I remember @DATE1, I grabred my nike hightops, and my pink ipod I started jogging at a slow while listening to my favorite song. Naturally by I felt amazing when my was complete going each day is as healthy as eating a bannana, @NUM1 apples, and cheese eery morning their healthy! ""@CAPS7 since technology has been a part of my life, my two daughters have not visited their grand parents in over @NUM1 years! This needs to step!"" @CAPS8 @PERSON1 to the press. Yes, comuters have ""online-talking"" devices such as @CAPS9, but if you are never going to spend quality time with family, this is a bad habbit. On @DATE3, @DATE2, my brother and I, were too busy on the computer, we missed a birthday party the family we are addicted to this device, and need to spend time with our loved ones. @PERCENT3 of all therapy computers have @CAPS2 into depresion and have been with their plains, due to the high amount of to do on this device and less time bonding with members of your Who would rather play on a old, gray, computer when you can have fun talking about you day and the game life with your family? @CAPS10's now a never! What will you choose? Do you agree that computers take over lives? If you try and prove me wrong just remember, nature is a big and many people are missing out on the advantage technology is taking over peoples excersing habbits, and many families are less bonding @CAPS10's up to you keep the population of @LOCATION1 in good hands!"
0,"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you @MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?"
0,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a majority of the @ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day. Our society has been around computers so often that some peole will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. This, however, is something to take as a concern. when people are dependent on computers too much, they loose valuble skills that the once possesed and they spend less time, outside exercising while also loossing touch with famly and friends. It has become near that computers have become along part of peoples lives. Computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" @CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to loose the ability to use books like encylopedias and atleses or even simmple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experienc, that I can barley look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuble information. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones. They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers. Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. When people begin to spend hte majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less excersise, and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survay of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be addicting. Students, parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any excersise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. but not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. Once, the only way for us to really talk to her through facebook. As you can see, computers can be a dangerous thing. think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably thnks of quiet a few. Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less excersising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy life style. Also when people use computers too much, they loose valueble skills. Remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am @NUM1-year old student in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Me being a teenager and all you'd probably assume that I love all of the new technology coming out recently. I am however, against it. Once someone gets on the computer, they wont' be offer hours. They are truly missing out on life. Computers users should have limits so that we as a country can improve our health standards, reconnect with friends and family, and protect ourselves from the vicious world of the computer. First of all, our health standards have fallen quite a bit. The obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT1 in the past @NUM2 years. Admit it, our country grows lazier and lazier by the minute when we have new technology to do simple tasks for us. Such as cracking eggs for us! It is unnecessary! I've also noticed that not many kids go outside and play anymore. What happend to going to your neighbor's house and asking them to play kickball? Our lives have been sucked into a black hole that is controlled by a cyber filled world. Gym class @MONTH1 be the only time that some students ever indulge in physical activities. It is time to make our country healthy again just one step at a time. Our second step could relate to reconnecting with family and friends. Secondly, our lives are no longer personal. We share everything with everyone. Take my mom for example. If she wanted to reconnect with high school friends, she could easily go on facebook and type them a message. Sure that's easy but wouldn't it be so much greater if my mom wrote a letter. It adds a more personal touch to whatever my mom wants to say. I'm also positive that the receiver would much rather get a letter than a facebook message. The internet lets you reconect, but the experience of meeting up with the person @MONTH1 lead you to much greater rewards. Not to mention that the internet can be very dangerous. The world of computers can be very dangerous to the unexperienced eye. First of all, there are many cases of cyber bullying. Not only has cyber bullying hurt people's feelings some kids have taken their life because of it. It happens everywhere and it needs to be stopped. Secondly, people put up provocative pictures themselves, which can lead to stalkers or ridicule. Girls and boys can get kidnapped by other people because of this. In some cases, because of the pictures, two people will meet one will ask if they can meet somewhere and then they can get taken, @CAPS3, there are many many hackers. If you input a credit card number on a site, someone could use it to put even more many on the cord. Finally, viruses come around all the time, In order to clean them off or if you have to buy a new computer, it costs a decent amount of money, which you would not want to waste. In conclusion, I believe that people need to limit themselves with how long they spend on the computer, and what they do an it as well. I'm not saying that computers should be banned; people just need to be aware of what they do. Instead of spending three hours on facebook, why not spend half-an-hour on facebook and then go outside, play with their friends, and embrace the sweet scents of nature. Computers can be useful, when used the right way. Until then, we should try to put out a good message of staying fit, getting outside and learning how to do things for ourselves."
0,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have advance a lot since they were first made. Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain, while others see it has a learning device. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online. To start off, computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child. When you're on the computer you're just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it. Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite, instead of taking the time to go outside. By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy, and they need to do something productive, not play computer games and talk to their friends. All school day they talked to their friends, they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy. By using the computer as a babysitter, you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games, and they aren't properly taking care of their body. On the other hand, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on @LOCATION2 that was do in a week, what would you do? You can't fly to @LOCATION2 and ask the @CAPS1 people what you want to know. That would be a waste of time and money. And if you go the library and they don't have any books, then you're in trouble. But by using the computer you can find endless information about @LOCATION2, and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to. Also, if you were going to @LOCATION4, but you knew nothing about @LOCATION4 you wouldn't be very confident about going. And you would feel like a tourist. But, if you went online and searched @LOCATION4, you could find the traditions, the clothing, and so much more. Lastly, if you wanted to know more about a famous person who isn't around anymore, you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did, how they became famous, and so on. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and you can't call to often because your phone bill will get to high, what do you do then? You talk online since you both have computers and it won't cost you to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in @LOCATION1. When we call there it costs a lot because they're so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on @ORGANIZATION1. Now, not only did we talk to them, but we also get to see them too. If your friend didn't have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework, you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places, and they allow you to talk online with other people."
0,"Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society."
0,"Dear local newspaper, A question that recently came to my attention is people are spending to much time on the computer, and if this is a good thing, I believe that computers are a good electronic item to have. I think this because, it helps people learn. Also, people can keep in touch with their friends even if they I've in a different country. In addition, it can help people or students be @CAPS1 please consider this in our newspaper. Would you like students/people to have internet and searches that can help them learn? The answer is ""yes"". Having to computers can help students to learn. They can go onto @LOCATION2 and type in any question they want to be answered. Picture this a child has a question that she wants answered, but she is embarrased to ask her parents. She can simply type the question in on her computer and get hundreds of answers. There is nobody in the world that knows everything, but there are computers that do. Computers can give you the answer to any question. When my mom was little she didn't have access to a computer all the time. @CAPS1 when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know. If they didn't know the answer than she couldn't know the answer. If more people had computers then they would the to questions. Computers are a good way to keep in touch with people. These are @CAPS4 programs such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, aim, ect.. My dad owns a buisness and needs to be in touch with people for seven @CAPS1 he around his iphone to talk to them by email. It helps my dad know when pappers and whos asking on what. I asked ten adults if they think everyone should have to a computer and ten out of ten said ""yes."" @CAPS4 people think that friends and family important and should stay with them every and a while. I have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1, but I cant contact her with my phone because are doesnt me and her talk on @CAPS2 all the time. @CAPS1 if people dont own phones then you can still stay in contact with computers. if they far away. Do you have perfect handwriting? The answer is probably no. People use @ORGANIZATION1 all the time because there handwriting isn't Computers help people stay clean and tidy. Computers have of folders and programs to store information you need. This all stays next all on the computer. My friend just get a computer for her office. Before she got it one hand everything and kep them all her desk in a mess. She had filled with pappers. But after she got a computer she typed everything neatly and kept all her pappers in the folders of her computer. She was @CAPS1 neat and clean that she got promoted. My friends moms changed because she got a computer. She became and cleaner. Picture this you are overwhelmed by all the papers on your desk. You dont know what papper is what. Well if you had a computer you could type eerything and keep them in your computer files. also @PERCENT1 of adults staying is good. I know you the local newspaper, have a very hard job and decision to make. I beileve that computers are good and helpful. Because they can help people find information they need. Also, they can keep people in touch with buisness workers, friend, students, family, ect. In addition, computers can help people get neat and clean. @CAPS1 please consider puting my essay in the Newspaper."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society."
0,"Dear local newspaper, more and more people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that they benefit society. The use of computers has greatly contributed to the weight issue in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 cannot find the time to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air, and they almost never see their family or friends. Computers have a negative effect on people and must be used less frequently. First off, computers are a minus for @CAPS1 because they can become addicting and @CAPS1 people do not receive their much needed exersize. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of computer users only get about three hours of exersize each week. Which is far below the minumum. in addition, @PERSON2, a childrens physician stated, @CAPS1 people think that computers are harmless to their health, but actually, when children sit at the computer for hours, fat is building up on their bodies, which quickly leads to obeisity. @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1 displayed an article last week, listing the harmful effects of computer use. They are @CAPS2 on the top @NUM1 list of contributers to weight gain the country. A few minutes turn into hours, and then you are hooked. @CAPS1 never go outside, and dont get the proper excersize. Although @CAPS1 feel that computers are helpful to society, they have negative effects on the body which can be hurtful. Moreover, computers are a minus because they take up @CAPS1 peoples time, which then does not allow them to go outside and enjoy the @CAPS3 air. Dr @PERSON5, a health specialist has said, @CAPS3 air and the outdoors are crucial for a growing childs developement. @CAPS4 @CAPS3 air, they @MONTH1 grow at a very slow pace, and sadly enough, miss a part of their childhood. @CAPS5 says that computers are mainly to blame for this issue, and in order to fix it, must be used far less frequently. Additionally, @NUM2 out of @NUM1 adults and children are only outside on an average of two days because they are emailing or using the computer. @PERSON3, a youngman, never went outside except for walking to the mailbox each afternoon. His reason? @CAPS5 was on the computer, emailing , gaming not enjoying the great outdoors. As a result, @CAPS5 grew weak and regreted going outside. One @MONTH1 feel that computers allow the average person to learn of far away places, however, they @CAPS2 take away from their valuable time outdoors. Finally, computers are minus because they take away time to spend with family and friends. CNN.com reported that families in @LOCATION1 are rapidly growing apart due to lack of family dinners and family outings. Reporters point their fingers towards the computers, because this is where @CAPS1 families claim that they spend most of their time. @CAPS2, a recent survey showed that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are lost over the course of six months because they never see each other outside of school. @PERSON1, an @ORGANIZATION2 school student claimed that she and her friend @PERSON4, didnt speak for over three months, and never noticed because they were always playing games on their computers after school. One @MONTH1 understand why someone else might think that computers teach hand eye coordination, but really they only destroy strong family bonds and potential @PERSON3 lasting friendships. To conclude, computers have a nasty effect on @CAPS1 across @LOCATION1. They have greatly contributed to the lack of exersize, eliminate time in the @CAPS3 air, and loose family and friend time for @CAPS1. Thse negative effects must be known to the public, as @CAPS1 of them use their computers far too much. Please let the facts be known!"
0,"The computer is a good way to contact family and friend. People send messages all over the world or just to fon. People like playing video games or be on websites that they like. People all over the world by laptops to travel to one place to another. Everybody don't be on computer because they think its not go to have but some people do like to have one to be sending messages to hang out with one another or be talking about how was your day. Many people want computer because they do have enough money to @CAPS2 one. Some computers cost a lot @MONEY1 money like, @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 and even more than @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 it depend witch one they get. Around the world many people sell their computers to get money to @CAPS2 different stuff like, shoes, clothes or games. They always sell stuff on ebay to get less or more money, instead they can't take the computer back to get your money or to get a new computer. People want the classic computers, but now they come out with new ones like, touch screen ones. Many people been buying them at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION1. Every seens the new computers came out people been buying a lot the company been making a lot @MONEY1 money from making the touch screen computers. Every new year the company make new computers so they can get thousands or @MONEY1. Company all over world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and @CAPS2 them. New styles they make more money they make. Some people make their own companies to get money like the other companys get theirs, but some @MONEY1 the money you make some goes to the government. The money the give to the government is to take care @MONEY1 the homeless people. Computers are used from leaning or for fun. People share computers with other people they can't not share it because it wouldn't be fair. Some people take turne using it. Some people don't like taking turn with one another. Everybody share or have they own and they use it or not they can't force their server to it if somebody wants to net on it. Some people lie and say they were geting on it. People like joking around with others. Parents always say a computer is not a tag to play with computers cost a lot to repair and get it fixed all the people spill water on them a the computer mess up and the people be mad and maybe he/she just got a new computer. When computer first came out people bought them to see what they will be like. Many people liked them and it got all over the world and people were talking about them and the company made more and more until it got in stores all over the world. The computer got famase and the company made newer styles for everyone else. People bought a lot @MONEY1 computers everytime they come out with a new style. Many people had @NUM1, or @NUM2 at home as they @CAPS2 them. Companys made other company mad because the other companys were making better styles. People were ordering online to get new computers. And company how make them is making a lot @MONEY1 money. Company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the @CAPS1 one ever. When they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one. Some company joined to make one together."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 name us @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers! they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games, or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educatiional websites on the internet which children can learn from. In @CAPS1 personal life I can name so many examples @ORGANIZATION1 entetainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is sloveling infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. Also, expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook, or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1 and since we do not see him often. our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because @ORGANIZATION1 this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends, or family. Sixty-three percent @ORGANIZATION1 the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most @ORGANIZATION1 the time. Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. this shows how much people communicate over the computer using, facebook, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at @CAPS1 house, everytime I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6 devistation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they foud out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 recieve news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are!"

Entertainment is dull, and it is hard to receive books for learning. Ending the usage @ORGANIZATION1 such @ORGANIZATION1 technology as computers would surely be the first step to sending us back to such a barbaric time! Computers present job opportunities, educational opportunities, and a way to communicate with others! Furge you to continue using computers, for without computers our modern civiliz would be lost! Firstly, it is important to note, during our economic crisis, that the development and manufacturing @ORGANIZATION1 computers creates thousands @ORGANIZATION1 jobs! In fact, each year @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION3 jobs are created in the @CAPS5.S alone in accordance with the development @ORGANIZATION1 computers! @CAPS14 the customers who buy these products were to stop losing them, these jobs would be lost and any progress we've made in the economic crisis would surely fall! Do you, the fair people @ORGANIZATION1 our nation, wish to be responsible for such a catastrophe!

0,"Dear newspaper writers, Have you ever used a computer and learned of a way that it improves your day and makes life more interesting? Well, if you have, then you have had a taste of how computers benefit society. I use a computer to help me keep track of which of my favorite producs are being made and i can even watch my favorite shows on the computer. Computers can also help inother ways beyond watching shows and finding out about newly released iems. For instance, they teach hand-eye coordination every time you use the mouse. also, plenty of websites give information about faraway places and other people, and i bet you guys use almost @NUM1 of those websites. Lastly, communication on the web is a major part of people's lives. Just read on, and i'll tell you more about the wonder of computers! First of all, hand-eye coordination improvement is a major issue with computers.I used to have little to no coordination, but now, after using computers, I can use my sense of touch and sight to do anything, even with my bad hand. You must it forget all of the helpful and even fun computer programs made for the sake of teaching coordination. I remember a program hat tought me how to easily type letters on the computer without moving my hand around. I only know of two other hand-eye coordination exercises, and they are playing difficult video games for hours and hours and boring physical exercises that don't really help. So, basically, computers are the best way to help your eyes and hands work together. Also, if you want, you can search for info about faraway places such as @LOCATION1, and people such as the man who invented the sandwitch. For example, i recall a time when i had to make a poster for @PERSON1, and i searched on the internet for a icture and information about him, as well as where his @DATE1 championship took place. There also a program called @ORGANIZATION1 which someone to se every inch of our planet. @PERCENT1 of americans use the computer to get their information on people and places. There are some pieces of information that are found on the computer that can't be found in a book. These are some of the reasons that a computer is the best place to get information. Lastly, communication on a computer is fun, and sometimes a necessity. This reminds me of a time when i wrote a letter on the internet to my favorite company about the upcoming robocop movie, and they actually responded to my letter. There is a website called myspace.com which is used for introducing people to other people. There have been instances of communication over the web where people would be hunted or killed after telling the stalker their name and adress, and that is why new privacy systems are made all the time. Before i forget, there are two computer games made for socializing and having fun at the sametime: @CAPS1 of warcraft and second life. Communicating on the internet doesn't just benefit society, it connects it, too. I hope that this letter better helps you understand how important computers are to society. Computers have special ways of helping people learn hand-eye coordination. Information is easily found and in great quantities on the internet. Lastly, the web brings thousands of people together almost everyday. The computer actually helps people live their lives. If they were bad, @PERSON2 wouldn't still make them. Please, make the right decision and support computers the way i do."
0,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 is obvious or should be obvious to everyone that computers have mainly had a positive effect on everyone. There are some that argue about how computers have made things worse but in reality our world has just improved with this highly sophisticated manor. If  our people of @LOCATION1 didn't have our computers we would all be lost. Computers are spontaneously fascinating because they keep people learning about what's going on in the rest of the world, they let people communicate in a matter of seconds, and they help people learn about anything they want. The first detail of why computers have benefited us so well is how @CAPS1 helps us learning about the world. Whenever you go on website there is probably and telling you something that's happening in another country. Without computers people would never know of the starvation of the people of @LOCATION2. If you go to any news website the homepage usually tells you a lot about something important happening in the world right now. Even after these facts people still say you can just read a newspaper. This is very false however. If you are reading the news and something big happens the news can't change. If you read newspaper online however, the sites are constantly edited keeping you exactly up to time on what's going on, without computers our country would sound ignorant and foolish for we woudn't have an idea of what's going on in the world. The continuing detail on why computers are intriguingly important is because people can communicate with a chatter in a matter of seconds. If you need to ask something to someone you can just send them message and they get back to you very quickly. People will say @CAPS2 can do these things but they can't do one thing a computer can do and that's webcam. With a webcam you can contact a person and talk them like you're with them. You can even see them on your computer screen. This is great for friends that move away or parents that are on work trips. You just click on the webcam button and the person you want to webcam with and you can see them without even being near them. Computers bring communication to a whole new level and without @CAPS1 we'd be out of date and lost. The last reason computers have done only goods is that @CAPS1 helps people learn of whatever they'd like. If you need to learn about something for a project instead of searching through a book store or library or a book store you just search up wahat you need and find @CAPS1 out. You can type whatever you want to learn about into a computer and learn all about the subject in an hour. Computers have made our society more intelligent and that will help us in the long run to keep our human race alive. We maybe people who rely on technology but in our generation @CAPS1 is only making us smarter with all of its computer search engines. After the facts that have been presented here @CAPS1's plain to see that computer have done so much good for custle bad just fades a way. These ingenius devices keeps us informed of the worlds problems, let people communicate in a matter of seconds, and they let people learn of whatever they want very quickly. There are so many positives affects computers have had on us that @CAPS1 is almost impossible to beleive they are a problem like a egative affect on us."
0,"Computers are a very useful advance in technology but I think they consume too much time from people when they could be excersising, interacting with others, or learning about things on their own rather than using a computer to do their work for them. America already has a lot of children who are not excersising enough. Adults are starting to increase their numbers in that category as well. Having a computer at hand all the time is not really the best for a person. @CAPS1 tempts you to use @CAPS1 all the time for unnecessary things when you could be excersising and lowering the percentage of people who use computers a lot every day. People of all ages are starting to fail to realise that computers are at your service, but aren't really always the last thing for you, a lot of children play computer games and less childrens are going outside and excersising. When you excersise you can do @CAPS1 with friends and others while bringing up your heart rate and being able to excersise more often. The more children make @CAPS1 is better to excersise than to play on the computer. the thought will spread but until we get children in that mindset. They will continue to be tempful to use computers over excersising. Humans were made as they could internet with each other. People can't talk and be with others @CAPS2 all they do is surf the web @CAPS1 is important for people to be with others because @CAPS1 makes friends and gets you further in life. You cant go far @CAPS2 your computer is your only friend. When you internet with others, you start to learn more about the person and usually you get to be quiet where you are with good friends. Making friends is also difficult to do when you all of you fine or the computer. Computers do have with where you unless you have your computer and go out to to actually the person is person really making real friend @CAPS2 you ever hae the choice using and guilty of with friends no matter what the activity choose to go out because @CAPS1 will you talking to people in is a lot more fun. Computers has and valid information know for a start but what people to be lazy and look up information on computer. I think that people need to make effort to go out and find and explore the world yourset and in person rather than taking someone else's word for @CAPS1 who actually explored the fact on their own. There are so many things to in the world @CAPS2 people would just realize that they got all that information from a screen. @CAPS1 is actually, I think more valuable to explore things for yourself rather than not person. experiencing @CAPS1 because you remember more and you can relate to other things related to that more you actually @CAPS1. Being able to find out information rather than trusting someone or what they thing who is usually a stranger to you is much more valuable in life. Overall, computers are a very good asset to our society, but they should not replace people excersising, interacting with others, finding out information or your own @CAPS2 more people would do these three things more often our society wouldn't be so depindent on computers. We would be able to take care of @CAPS2 computers ever failed because we would know how to do things that are obscure to us when all we use is life for everything is a computer."
0,"Hour after hour of gaming online and posting blogs on social networking sights is all one sees. Unaware at there surroundings, many people zone to their computer screens and only break @CAPS4 absolutely necessary. That is not what the world should become but that is what is society is creating. Computers do not create positive benefits to society. Because of all the time spent on the computer, people's bodies are taking the negative effects. There is also less and less face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Another huge issue is cyber bulling. These are all problems that should be addressed. With all the time spend on a computer in a stuffy, dark room, how will our bodies be maintained properly? Exercise is a key ingriedient to healthy living. It is like trying to make bread without flour, without that necessity the bread will not rise its full potential. It is the same with the health and functions at our bodies. Exercise must be took part in to burn fat and calories, but it is also needed to build and maintain muscles. In fact, muscles start it is recommended to get in at least one hour of exercise of outside play a days. Not many succeed with this goal, which brings up another negative effect to the body. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 helps to maintain strong bones. To get the recommended dose of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 a day you only need to absorb @NUM1 minutes of sunlight a day. It doesn't seem like a lot but @PERCENT1 of our population is not outside to recieve it. Instead, they are inside on their computers. Parties, lunch breaks, or even a family dinner are great times to socialize. But, what if one day you decided you were going to skip your lunch break with friends and instead spend time posting a daily blog. This is social time lost. If this habit continues you might soon see yourself drifting away from your friends because you don't make the time to spend lunch break with them. Even @CAPS4 a child interactions @CAPS4 chatting with friends on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6, anything could be said. Children wont learn at a young age how to think on there fact language. This will effect their later years @CAPS4 interviewing for things such as colleges or even jobs. Social skills are the difference between success and failure. Spending life on a computer is equivalent to being a caterpillar in their while at least attempting to be an extreme will turn you @CAPS7 and @CAPS7 are all created with the ominous cyberbulling. One simple way to prevent this is spending less time in the computer. The effects of cyber bulling can be brutal. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be bullied in face then over the internet. The reason being a of cruelty is displayed through cyberbulling over the internet because it takes much less courage to type something up then it for a bully to say something to them victims face. Such cyberbulling has even led to suicides. In fact, a girl in committed suicide due to cyber bulling just @NUM2 weeks ago. If you don't have In conclusion, computers produce more negative effect on society than good. A lack of exercise and proper body maintenance results. Reduced social interacting and skills also result. And maybe most importantly cyberbulling which takes lives occurs. In prevent society from turning into a social waste and felled with the glow of computer screens, lets all turn the monitor and get outside with nature and all its benefits."
0,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 new amazing technologies are coming out of this new age. One of the @CAPS1 is computers. If you spend your time wisely on them, they can help you communicate, learn, and relax. One brilliant thing computers can do is help you communicate. Do your cousins, the @CAPS2, live in @LOCATION1 state? Mine do, and the way my family communicate with them is by sending emails. Email is also a fun and easy way for friends to communicate. Emailing is also a more casual way to communicate with people. For @CAPS1 guys, calling a girl's house can 'be very intimidating. Communicating to her through email is a fun and simple way to talk to girls without them thinking you like them. My friend @PERSON2 email's the girl he likes all the time and says ""@CAPS3 is fun, and @CAPS3 is not as, never racking as if I had to call her."" @CAPS4 benefit of uding computers is that there is endless knowledge on the internet. Computers can help you learn from all around the world. My sister @PERSON1 is a softmore in college, but the problem is that the college she learns is texas @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 would be to difficult to have her live on campus because @CAPS3 is far away. So she takes college lessons online, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of college learn through online applications, and of that , @PERCENT2 of them graduate. You can learn in college and live at with your family at the same time, thats to computers. @CAPS4 amazing about the computer is that @CAPS3 is relaxing. You can play games on and watch movies, and even read the news on a @DATE1 @TIME1 like my dad always likes to do. My neigbors @PERSON3 and @CAPS5 both agreed that ""plating computer in the morateg is a and way to more yourself up and start off your day,"" I definately with them and enjoy playing online games with them. When we play world of in the @TIME1, we have fun, and the game. A stastic says that @PERCENT2 of videogames players are fit and . Are you stresses out off your home from work? Well thats a thing of the because you can get off the computer and fed very relax. Just because I believe computers are a reccrity in these times. I do not believe that you should be on them for excessive times. @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS6 all agreed that ""the computer should be taken in moderation."" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and my friends all do is play internet games and talk on them, and after a while. We all decide to go outside and play basketball. Three days ago we all did that, @CAPS8 and more and @PERSON2 were all playing a computer game called world of wareroft. We taliking microphones and an internet website that lets you talk as if @CAPS3 was through a phone. They both live on my street, so we occioed to all go outside and play basketball, and play more computer later. If you monitor your time playing, then you can play and get your daily exercise. Do you want to go home and relax after a long day of writing @ORGANIZATION2's? I am sure I do, and one way is by going home and playing computer. Does your husband have a meeting four states away? Well, the computer can help you say good night to him and that you love him. Computers help people communicate, help you learn, and allow you to relax ofter a hard d ay of work."
0,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently become aware of the debate regarding the effects of computers and the internet. I strongly support the influence computers have on society today. Computers not only effect the medical world but they effect the economy as well. Computers also effect @CAPS8 education. My initial reason why I support computers and internet is that they can effect the medical world. Imagine you are on a trip in @LOCATION1. You get hit by a car and you are severly injured. You do not have your medical records and you have a metal plate in your head. The doctors in the @LOCATION2 send an email to your doctors in @LOCATION1 and they are informed of the plate before they do an @CAPS2. Computers just saved your life. Without computers or internet you would have been given an @CAPS2 and the plate would have been pulled out of your head. My secondary reason why I support computers and internet is that the internet opens up new opportunities for @CAPS8 to learn. The internet can help @CAPS8 research for projects, labs, tests, and @CAPS4.A.T.'@CAPS4. Last year my class was assigned an essay at the end of the year. The subject was to find a way for the @LOCATION2 to lessen @CAPS5 casualties. We were given time to research our ideas. I had no clue what to write about but after I researched a little on the internet I decided to write about privitizing the @CAPS5 because @CAPS5 contractors have been proven to be more effective than enlisted soldiers. I was the only one in the class that used that idea and I recieved an ""A"" for the essay. Every last piece of information I used was found on the internet. This shows that the internet not only gave me an idea for an essay that I had no idea what to write about but it also gave me all of the evidence I needed to support my idea. This could be true for many @CAPS8 around the world. In addition, @CAPS8 can learn about far away countries easily. Unlike before the internet was invented. Back then, you either had to read an entire book about the country you were studying or actually go to the country itself. My final reason why support computers and the internet is that they can effect the economy. In these hard economic times the @LOCATION2 is relying on the internet to help stimulate our economy. The intenet can make people money and can also help people find jobs. Both of these things are crucial to the economic recovery of our country and are made easier by the internet. Many people buy and sell things over the internet. In fact, forty percent of all trade is done through the internet. This alone could effect the amount of time it takes our country to recover from our current recession. Also, in order to use the internet, you have to pay. This could help some companies get out of the red zone. Internet plays a very large role in our economy. In conclusion, computers and the internet play a very large role in our lives. Medical disasters can be simply avoided if medical information is transfered through the internet. @CAPS8 can be given ideas and supporting evidence for their school work as well as learn about countries quicker and easier than ever before. In addition, the internet can also stimulate the economy by making people money and finding people jobs. These are all positive outcomes that can improve our country greatly. "
0,"You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society."
0,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job."
0,"@CAPS8 more and more technology is being invented, people use the computer to do work and to learn. But more time on the computer is not neccessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my freind @CAPS1 for example. He was a triathlete, who trained everyday so he could be in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. But then he got his computer. @CAPS1 had suddenly lost interest in exercise and spend his whole day checking his e-mail instead of training. But he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers. Experts say that @CAPS5 with computers at home get only @PERCENT1 of the exercise @CAPS5 without computers get. @CAPS5 with computers also were more likely to be overweight and choose chips over an apple in a study performed at @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1, who headed this study said, @CAPS5 are taught by society that computers can do such wonderful things and educate them. However, they are not taught how bad they can be for you health when used too much."" @CAPS6, computers are a problem to our health. Another reason computers are a problem is because they strain you eyes. When my school had disabled people come and talk to us @DATE1, there was a blind lady named @PERSON5, who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spend too much time on her laptop. But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientests at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientist, @PERSON3, reported, ""@CAPS8 more people begin to use the computer, more people seriously hurt their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3."" @CAPS9, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or talked to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a @CAPS10 an fighting dragons on the internet game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting @CAPS5. ""Too many @CAPS5 are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It's alarming!"" @CAPS12 reason could you have to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your @CAPS5! Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous for our health. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and health. Is this @CAPS12 you want for your self and generations to come?"""
0,"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for useage of priveleges that we already have. While people are using the computer for random activities, they are not having any physical activity. Also emailing and facebooks are great websites to communicate with but people are checking emails all the time instead paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work. With this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks. Computers are great invention but with todays society there are to many issues that aren't always being appointed. In the first place, people aren't getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video chatting with a friend. About @NUM1 of america is obess so excercising should definitely be a priority but with these new websites and activities on the computer people are getting held back. With this, kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time. The computers have so many stupid activities that are not needed which make us not excercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed. Indeed computers are a technology that is needed but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as excercising and being healthy. In addition to computers taking away from excerscising they are also taking time away from your family. For example, @TIME1 when my dad got home. From a long day at work no @CAPS1 truly a bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sisters friend just said on facebook. Family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way, computer use absolutely has to be changed. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs but when you rae talking to your sister through facebook eventhough there just in the next room. It is lobvious needs to be done. Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than @CAPS1. Finally, computers take away family but also schoolwork and works. Most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework. This is unexeptable and can be away, kids and teenagers are always playing games, facebooking friends and video chatting making them realize at that they need to start their home work! A girl from @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 time I was on facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my @CAPS2 essay!"" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain. Moreover, yesterday I remember that I was video chatting my friend for @NUM2 hours and didn't start my homework until @NUM3! The computer evryone that goes it which is uneceptable. Without computers a negative affect people. off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible. Also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them. With this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework. Overall computers are that make life that much more stressful. Thank you for listening."
0,"Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.That is why computers have a negative effect on our society."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definetly taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & @CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article."
0,"North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects."
0,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I have heard talk going around about computers. People are saying they are bad because they take away @CAPS1 much of our lives. I say that isn't true. We do spend a lot of time on computers but that doesn't necacerally mean we are wasting our time. Computers provide us with infinente knoledge. They allow us to talk to our friends and family across the world, and they have allowed human society to take massive leaps in everyday things. First, they provide infinete amounts of knowlegde. Today, you can find just about any thing you want on a computer. An expieriment was conducted last year by a @ORGANIZATION1 proffesor, who @ORGANIZATION1 people and society. Professor @PERSON1 took a pole to see what people did when faced with difficult, everyday questions. He went house to house and risked average people. Over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of them went straight to their computers or laptops to look it up. Another <@PERCENT1@NUM2> took out thier cell phones, went on the internet and looked it up. The last @PERCENT1 said ""I don't know"" and walked away. This adds up to a total of <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of people who use their computers or internet. Is that a large number of people or what? This reminds me about a good friend of mine from a while ago. He got onto the gameshow ""@CAPS1 you wanna be a @CAPS2?"" and was doing pretty well. We went to his @ORGANIZATION3 house to watch it with her. She is a very intelegent woman, but doesn't know every thing. @CAPS4 friend ended up winning @MONEY1 because of a computer. He get stuck on a question and used phone a friend. When he did this, the phone in his @ORGANIZATION3 house started ringing. I hadn't even celized it but she was already up and at the computer  it up. She found it in less than @NUM4 seconds, gave him the answer, and won him @MONEY2. What would've happened if she didn't have that computer? They would've gotten nothing. You see, publishing if it weren't for that computer, even for that one website, he would have sot. This website is called, ""@CAPS3"". @CAPS3 is the #@NUM5 most used website. I provides countless websites and information for just about anything. Isn't that helpful? @CAPS4 second reason involves family and friends. Websites susch as yahoo and facebook, allow you to instant messages from across the world. Others like @ORGANIZATION4 allow you to web chat with someone, you can see them on the computer monitor and hear them too. For example, @CAPS4 mon works for a company called ganz. She is constatnly traveling places. Even now, as im writing this, she is on a plane flying to @LOCATION6, @LOCATION1. She also goes to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3,  places in @LOCATION4, and to @LOCATION5 as well. Most of these trips last only a week or @CAPS1, except for @LOCATION5. She goes to @LOCATION5 @NUM6 out of @NUM7 months every year. She misses @DATE2, and @DATE1. @DATE1 is the worst for me. Not only does she miss halloween, but she misses @CAPS4 birthday. I am @NUM8 right now and the last time @CAPS4 mother was home for @CAPS4 birthday was when I was @NUM9. I can't take it but on @CAPS4 birthday she sets aside two times to talk to me on @ORGANIZATION4. @ORGANIZATION2, if you take away computers you take away the only chance for me to talk to @CAPS4 mother for weeks at a time. @CAPS4 last reason is about computers and the advances they help us make."
0,"Computers have been one of technoligy's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfall. Originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places, computers have been proven to do quick the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids. It is the main reason why society is today, predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation. These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removes from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. Since @DATE1, the amount of adolescent users has shot up @PERCENT1. Amazing ly enough, @PERCENT2 of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. This takes away the pleasures or reading, exercising, spending time outside and hnging with friends and fmaily. These negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society, especially teenagers, the most frequent users. As a result diet and exercise are curtailed, raising the obesity number by @PERCENT3, and lock of ourdoor or family activities have promoted anti-social @CAPS1 this alarming rate out fufture generation @MONTH1 indeed be balancing on a cracked foundation. In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also the source of yet another act. As long as the computers are plugged, they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Use of computers have to cause brain-tumors and leukemia, asw ell as brain disorder and cancers. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cuse and stants the child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day to @ORGANIZATION1 compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are @NUM3 times as likely to develop such possibilities. The ultimate prevention to such risjs is to to the rest of such causes, computers and it completely. Lastly, computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open. As an adolescent unthinkingly says the web and chtrooms, they are at risk of atteck by thousands of children predators prowling the web. Computers contain extremely valuable and secret information, such as names, birthdates, genders and even social security numbers. With one click, acfepting a strongers inivte, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obation such valuable information. Or the predators @MONTH1 be less postive and attack directly-asking questions to the child themselves. In fact, a familiar story tells the unfortunate fare of one local @CAPS2 girl, who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. This online predator smoothly invited her to the mall, where they moved. A couple devastating, weeks later, the girl's reamin in were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen. Three for, computers are simply too dangerous, a predator's thumbbook as they search for their next victim. by removing the computer, you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well. It is amazing to learn that technology's greates advanvcement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. Lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunded by the ever distracting computer its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health and lastly, it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel, sneaky online predators awaiting your child on the web. By removing the source of all these troubles, those acts can be prevented and society @MONTH1 begin to the pain for reform."
0,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people our community use computers was an essenciail port of day-to-day. However, little do they known, the interaction between computers and humans can be negative. First of all, when going online, you discuss your thoughts with virtualpeople, rather than reel friends. Also, you do not recieve the required exercise and sunlight your body needs to provide to stay healthy. Finally, computers are a large distractron in the eyes of teenagers and students. Computers not only are negative, but decrease the ability of soeralizing in schools and other places in our community. Throught online chat rooms, facebook, and other anteractions between a group of people, can not only be harmful, but dangerous. For instance, @PERCENT1 of middle school students decide to become friends with or talk to people they never even heard of as seen before. As a result, you are trusting a figure you have never physically seen before, who might as well be sharing your personal information. Another reason that virtual negative, is because of the of socializing. Through recent studies, @NUM1 people only talk on facebook, without greeting one another in public. This can not only decrease your ability of speaking in public or in front of a group, but the idea of interacting with other people your age. Finally, virtual people on different networks can be figures that are harmful or not feel you who they. For instance, one girl from @LOCATION1 didn't know her ""bestfriend"" on facebook was a @NUM2-year-old man seeking information from her. However, the idea of no exercise appears to as important. Without exercise and the ability to get from sunlight, your body won't function properly. For instance, the required amount of hours to receive exercise is one hour per day. With on message of the goal won't be reached. reason exercise could be a top priority, because of the avaiable sunlight scientists have recently discovered that teenagers stay up late because of lock of sunlight while on the computer. As a result teen not receiving the proper sunlight but sleep grades. Finally, one last reason, is how children end even adults over the years have became choose, and overweight. The main factor is the race of sitting in front of your computer for more than @NUM3 hours a day. Exercise and socializing not only effect humans, but serve as a as well. Through online gaming and other programs on computers, these factors can serve as a huge distractions. For instance in @DATE1, @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 students didn't or forgot to do each task or assignment from school, due to computers. This both decreases and the to focus as well. Another aspect, its how teenagers are denying and disobeying chores given to them by parents. For instance, I remember being @NUM6, and telling my mother I would set the table, but was @NUM7 minutes late because of of a program. I was playing. This resulted in both a consequence and disadvantages lack responsibility one last reason, you @MONTH1 be an important stuation, but then decide to take a break. Without a time unit humans go on the internet not knowing how much time they have actually sent of it. All hree of these aspects to why computers are negative. Ever since the manufacturing of computers began all ages have been interested in the technology. However, computers are unsafe, due to virtual friends, hours of exercise have gone down, and people have continued to be distracted. Even though the world needs technology computers have their flaws."
0,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I have been hearing about people fighting over computers and if they are or are not good for our us. But I do have to say that I think they are good. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons why I say this is because it will allows you to talk to friends and family that are away or they can even be accross the street. @CAPS7 over all it's a great way to keep in touch with people. It also helps kids with school work. For example you @MONTH1 find games that will help you in @CAPS2 ever class you need or you can find information on certain things that you need to know for projects. The last idea I can come up with is that you can pay your bills online. You @MONTH1 not think this is a big topic but it is. Say if you have a bill that due tomorrow you can get emails stating that you have a bill due tommorrow and how much you need to pay. @CAPS7 these are my reasons for agreeing with the fact that computers are good for us. Alright, lets get started. My first reason for thinking that computers are good for us is that you can stay in touch with people such as your friends and family. But although there is the risk @ORGANIZATION1 people talking to strangers but that is their @CAPS2 I mom by that that they mine a stupid choice and they face the consiquences. But other than that most people do the smart thing and talk to the friends @ORGANIZATION1 family @CAPS3 or @CAPS4-@CAPS5 theres just a great @ORGANIZATION1 things you can do to stay in touch with friends and family. @CAPS7 I hope you are starting to think about the good things computers do for us. Well @CAPS10 it is time to tell you my @NUM1 reason for thinking computers are for us. This topic is school working is almost every class room you walk into there is a computer. The computers really help got school work They canprovide information on projects or even provide little games for extra help and I bet @NUM2 out @NUM2 students would agree with me. For example I just had a project on the ""@CAPS6 @NUM4's"" and I used my computer to find information about @CAPS7 it I can use the @CAPS8 for school work you can to. Alright @CAPS10 to start off my third reason for thinking @CAPS8's are good for us heres a quote from @PERSON1. ""@CAPS10 that we have had @CAPS7 many advances in technology it is @CAPS7 much easier to pay your bills online."" @PERSON2 is the top guy at @ORGANIZATION1 and he even thinks that paying bills online is a great help too. Plus if you forget about a bill they will send a to your @CAPS4-@CAPS5 or even give you a call. I even think it is easy. I watch my mom pay her bills and it is just click click done. This is my final reason for thinking that computers are good for us. @CAPS10 that you have heard my ideas I hope you join me and the other @NUM5 million people that think computers. But these three topics I just wrote about are only same @ORGANIZATION1 the things that computer makes easier. There are just @CAPS7 many things you can do on the computer. @CAPS7 I hope you agree with me. But I hope you remember the computer is as easy as a click @ORGANIZATION1 a botton."
0,"Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer. I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and ofcourse education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers aren't aware of their surroundings at all. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them. Adults also do use the computer, but not as frequent as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause safety issues. Now more than ever people use where they talk to friends. But, what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be what they think it is. Lately, on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because of people who they were talking on the internet was not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids. But, even besides having bad people online, computers can with your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your information to other people so, we really need to watch out. Computers though not only cause safety issues, but health issues also. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. T.V's use to be the issue for people not excercising, but now computers are doing just the same. There are so many things to do on the computer that just doesn't make you bored. That there means that there is no way to from it. But, you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like it's hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up. Computers can also have an impact with your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our computers do the same with education. Computers can really be bad with our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that than of them whom people spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're suppose to do simply becausewe're distracted. But, eventhough we forget our homework, we also @MONTH1 forget to study before a test. This would result in a in high grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people, but instead helping them. I think it's not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, etc. We have so many distractions in our that we don't need more! Computers really don't have a good effect on people. More and more people get computers everyday. They should know what its doing to them, and what's happening to the world around them go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe, go to the mall with friends and. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people."
0,"Dear People of @ORGANIZATION2 many computers do you have in you household? I'll admit myself that we have in mine, one for each person. However, I feel, that this technology has had a negative affect on people, despite its benefits to society is a whole at several personal risks, no matter @ORGANIZATION2 safe they think they are. The time spent staring at a desktop is the time you are take away from your own heath, and possible your lifetime. Yes, there are ways to communicate with person on a computer, but this process seperates people from their families, and teaches kids to live in a typed world, so they don't know @ORGANIZATION2 to act face to face. Then there are those people who use computers or any such technology to harm someone. Why would you give the real world for such chances? I have @NUM1 questions for you. @ORGANIZATION2 much time in one day do you spend on your computer and have you ever noticed the correlation between that amount of time and your pant size? A study done by a group at the @ORGANIZATION1 found that for every hour spent on a computer you gaini another half of a. Crazy, right? But this happens because you aren't execising or even just walking during this time, This also accurs because as you sit, there, your body's healthy doing anything, as it slows down your digestive systems. Another way that affects health is that is almost encourages unhealthy habits smoking. @PERCENT1of people who fail at an attempt to quit smoking spend an average of @NUM2 hours per day on a computer. This because your mind isn't, so i'ts free, to give in to small impulses and desires. We all know such unhealthy habit to bad to and eventually . When you ask your child what they do with their friends, you ever locking for the answer. We t'll a lot? No, because you know that the way someone sounds in a writter, phoned message, isn't always @ORGANIZATION2 they are in real life. If you have difficulting talking to or liking a person when you see them face to face, then your relationship with them isn't real. An all can lie to you or be cruel because the person on the other end forgets you are real. Computers are a way for kids to spend all their time on a false relationship. Two polls were taken by the same @NUM3 people. One asked if you had a good, or bad relationship with your family. The other asked @ORGANIZATION2 many hours you spend on a computer. The majority of @PERCENT2 people said the devote @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours to their computers but that same majority also said they have bad relationships with their family members. It doesn't take much to understand @ORGANIZATION2 this happens. Not only is the time separating a family, but as a person gets more addicted to their computer they become more wrapped up in their own, non existent world. Being online can be very dangerous, because there are people out there who want to hurt you, or are just plain bothering you. A few years ago, a teenage girl had a friend she completely truisted that she @CAPS1 often. They planned to meet at a mall. The same girl was found dead in that mall. As you maight have gathered, communications online can be dangerous, and very unsafe. Any one can have access to you and some people will contiunue to pester you wheneven you go online."
0,"Dear local Newspaper, The digital age is taking over human life! As technology progresses every day. People degress along with it. People spend too much time on the computer, playing video games, watching television, and listening or playing on their ipod. It is taking away from our luxeries of life and turning us all into overwight, lazy and disconnected people. We are loosing our minds and our lives are being taken over by computers. Some people don't even realize that they are spending upwards to eight hours a day sitting at the computer or texting on their phones, and this needs to stop. One of the largest problems in society today is obesity and it gets larger everyday. No thanks to computers. We spend eight hours a day sitting at the computer wer we could be outside getting sorie exercise, playing on a sports fear, or just enjoying life. Everywhere I look I see people texting, talking about who said what on facebook, and listening to their ipods. I'm not saying that it is a bad thing, but it becories bad when it is all people do the wholeday. You always hear that obesity is rising, and thats because all we do is sit online doing mindless things. No exercise leads to unhealthiness, which leads to obesity. Another thing that people don't realize is that when they're sitting at the computer, the'y usually grab something to eat too. Again, I'm reaching for an applr to eat, it's usually peotetoe chips of a soda. That's not helping the fact that you're not exercising. Its a double whammy that is turning society into an obese society. People are always saying, ""life goes by so fast,"" or, ""I wish I could slow myself down"". Well, those is one way to slow your life down: @CAPS1 your computer and television and go enjoy life! We spend so much time on the computer that it is just eating up our lives. If we had week of the year that everybody unplugged their computer and got out and enjoyed life, people would not be saying how fast life goes by. People just waste the time that they could be spending with their family or friends reconnecting and having fun. We would have a lot more spare time if we could stay away from our digital devise and cut back on how much we watch television. If you told certain people that they couldn't be on computer for a day. they would not be able to do it, and that's a major problem, and it gets worse ever, single day. A lot of people ask about the future of the digital age. Scientists will definately keep coming up with new devices, but what about the future humans in the digital age? If we keep going at this rate, pretty soon we will loose face to face meeting and everything will be online. All we'll be doing is sitting at the computer all day. I don't know about you, but I don't think I want to have my eyes not out of my lead from staring at a scren all day. In conclusion I really believe that the digital age is amazing, but it is turning society into a sack of couch potatoes, life is too short to be spending all of it glued to a computer screen. We need to get out and enjoy life because pretty soon, we'll all wake up and realize we wasted @NUM1 years of our lives on the computer."
0,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowlege. But, many people do not think about the negative affects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make comunication easy, but there are many negative affects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside excersising and communicating with friends and family. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know whats going on outside of the office. There, are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computers functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as microsoft powerpoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Typing can help majority with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great pendmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computer, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer, instead of ouside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abrevations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""i dont know"". This language is damaging how kids read and write. Although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can do also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. this is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened. As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe, if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their childs safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drasticly over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable."
0,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also computers have so many different forms of entertainment. Computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even @CAPS1 the hassle of coming home with thee assignment or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other @ORGANIZATION1 program such as powerpoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto boand paper. There adveances in communication through computers that have been made. Things such as cideo chat (vchat) where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on community by havinf simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can alos provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look out funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links websites where you con find details on your topic, or relative things one fun website is that of 'youtube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibility are endless on the web. Another fun website is '@CAPS3'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post viedos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friend, and provide entertainment. We should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science, and they are a great help, and also fun! "
1,"What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people @CAPS1 created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the oppurtunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual.      With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is theraputic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was dibbed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken back? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, ' @CAPS1 deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today their will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type?     Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person @MONTH1 be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the @ORGANIZATION1's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succesion from the @LOCATION1. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the @ORGANIZATION1 it created a hatred and false sense of the @CAPS4 in the childrens' eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child @CAPS1 is only @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it.      The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publically display a controlversial topic no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library @MONTH1 decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarentee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not lfe. Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual @CAPS1 they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public, it will just destroy an oppurtunity to grow.     Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public, because they are not the public. Every person poses their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies will no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality from the world. Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. The struggles of one person @MONTH1 be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow"
1,"Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away."
1,"In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many @CAPS1 are opposed to. While libraries @MONTH1 seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be.     One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @CAPS1 to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library.     A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an @CAPS2-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. @CAPS5 censorship should be applied to libraries. Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. @CAPS5 type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of @CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the @CAPS2-rated movie, if his @CAPS1 deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. @CAPS5 gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. @CAPS5 same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library.     Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @CAPS5 is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become @CAPS5 way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. @CAPS5 ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that @CAPS5 is acceptable? These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials.     These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. Today's society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable. While some @MONTH1 see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games. Removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often"
1,"Katherine Paterson, has stated a quote about @CAPS2 books off the self that are bad for our children. I believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea. There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that are not good for some people to read or hear about. Some people do not realize what they are reading and what they are watching.      Censorship for book, is a good way to keep people from knowing about things they do not need to know about. For example, little children do not need to be reading a book that has foul language or sexual contenet in the material. This would not be apporpriate for them to read. @CAPS2 these krinds of books out of there reach is a good idea so they do not go around cusing and talking about sexual things. Also, not just little children that people are worried about, they are also worried about people knowing things that they should not know about. Another example, while at war, librarians would take books off the shelf. Therefore, people did not know what was going on and they could not know what was happening.     Katherine Paterson once stated, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from a shelf- that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The author is stating that if we take away the bad books that should not be read, then there will be no books for any of us to read. She also satates, that if you have the right  to take them away then you need to do so if you think it is bad. If you had all the books in the world, and went to take out all of the offensive and not appopriate ones off the self, what would be left? Books have lots of meaning behind them and they also have good and bad meaning to them. @CAPS2 books that are bad or offinsive in anyway, off the shelf, @MONTH1 be a smart idea. You @MONTH1 see children today, that are learning about things that they should not know yet. You @MONTH1 think, 'wow' I never knew what they know at there age. You @MONTH1 have just learned about it, and they are younger and already know about it.       Trying to take music that is bad or offensive away, @MONTH1 be a little harder to do. People are still going to want to listen to that music, if it is taken away. There is not just bad music, there is lots of good music that could be listening to. It is that person listening to the music opinion to what they decide on. Everyone, is different in there own ways. Music, just as any other book, magazine, or even movie, is a personal opinion. @CAPS2 away the bad music, to try to cut back on what people @MONTH1 think about, is a good way of solving the problem. The problem is that too many young people, do not understand what many things mean. It is ok for these young children to not understand what everything means. Just because they do not know what something means, does not make them dumb. They have many years to learn what somethings mean in life.     Katherine Paterson, has made a very agurable point. If you have the ability to take something away that is bad, them do it. But just be aware that when you are finished, there @MONTH1 not be anything left for other people to learn aabout. Take movies as an example. Movies @MONTH1 have many offesive ideas in them, but when @CAPS2 them away, you have to think is this one movie worth @CAPS2 away. If not them leave it, there are plenty of worse movies out there, to take away. Watching a movie, is different then reading a book. In a book, you can make an image in your head of the setting, whereas in a movie the setting is playing on a screen for you already. In a movie, you do not have to think about what to imagine in your head, which @CAPS1 you not have to use your brain. In a book, you have to imagine a setting of the story that is happening, and you have to use your brain to think about what is going on and what is happening. Therefore, @CAPS2 movies and books that are bad off the market or the self is a good plan, if you do not want your children learning about things that you do not even know about.      All these examples, are a good way to support that @CAPS2 these materials off the self is a good idea in my opinion. Katherine @CAPS1 a clear point, that she believes that if she has the abilitty to take the materials off the shelf that are offensive, that she will. But on the other hand she also knows that when she is finished picking out all the offensive material, there you @MONTH1 not have any books left on the shelf for anyone else. In conclusion, @CAPS2 all the bad, offensive, and sexual content off the selfs @MONTH1 be challenging, but if that is what you are wanting, then you have the ability just as anyone elae has the ability. Once again, Katherine Paterson states, ' All off us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."
1,"When mankind was young and primal the stories created by mankind were passed through oral translation. However these stories were subject to decay as the human mind can not recall evey detail that it hears. Great stories that are lost to time will never be recovered. Then written languages were developed to keep better more accurate records of data and stories that were told. Many sheets of written work were bound together into what is now known as a book. Archealogists have found troves of books predating @CAPS1 and many thereafter. These books let us peer into the past with such detail that no human could remember the remarkable events that took place in that time. Books are still published following the traditional use of information transmiter and story teller but they have changed in their content. When many books were written in @LOCATION2 many feared to speak openly about their views through their books for fear of persecution by the @ORGANIZATION2. Today in a more evolved society where people can speak freely some books are published that do not fit everyone's ideaologies. But why should the authors be afraid of this? Haven't we evolved as a people to let people speak their beliefs and not fear prosecution? I think so.     The world today is filled with many religions and beliefs that all share different views of our history and of world events. This can cause uproar when a book is published that does not agree with the individuals belief's. There have been a few books published in the last @NUM1 years that have caused such outcry's that cause people to desperatley want to remove them from the children's eyes. One such book is '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4'. This book is the story of a black man and his master during pre-civil war times where slaves were legal. This book could be considered hainous to readers soully on their morals. The story is graphic at some points throughout the novel and can anger people. Many school's and instituion's have already banned this book from their libraries. Some books such as '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' can clearly be denoted as 'harmful,' or 'inhumane,' to some readers. However, people opposing the banning of this particular book state that 'Our children need to learn from history so they do not repeat it.' And many take this as a valid arguement.      Then again, some books are hated entirely for their content because it does not agree with a person's religion. A more recent example of a book series that some say is, 'unfit,' and 'harmful,' for a child to read is the famous @CAPS8 @CAPS9 series. Millions of people enjoy the book series for it's stories of a young boy at a wizard school. But some people banned their children from reading them because they believe that the book is telling children that witchcraft is an acceptable practice. This extremely violated their religious views and wanted the book series to be removed form library shelves everywhere. This arguement is just as legitimate as the one for '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4'. Though they are both considered 'bad' they are just expressions of the authors mind not intending to brainwash children or start a second civil war. The authors just had and innocent idea for a book and decided to put those ideas onto paper. The authors are just as innocent as everyone else even the protestors to their books.     This new age has brought the front of a changing planet. Connections between people are becoming faster and ideas can spread to a wider audience. This world also has new rules on what people are allowed to talk about. In the @ORGANIZATION1 it is every citizens right to have free speech without persecution. Some other countries have stricter laws than the @LOCATION1 yet are still less strict than they used to be. This new age has also brought about new forms of communication such as, video, text, phone call, internet, and many others. Today's literature has evolved into the digital realm. magazines, books, movies, and music are all now digital. The music today is a new genre and can contain lyrics that not everybody approves of. The artists are just expressing themselves through lyrics and rythm they are not trying to offend anybody. This music spreads to a larger audience around the world and thus causing a larger revolt against it. Today it is much harder to deal with the masses of people that have access to your creations. This can cause people to stop creating their work.      Why? Why extinguish this unknown talent just because some people didn't like it? Many people do not care they just want it gone. Killing this talent is like killing soemone for the color of their skin. It is just wrong. Artists today should not have to live in fear of how their media will be judged around the world. This media should not be destroyed it should be saved for future generations to watch, listen too, or read. That's how we learened about our past right? Why should we try and clean up the media to appease a few people and create the false illusion of a perfect world when there is no such thing. We can not clean up what has happened. We can only learn from it for a better understanding of our fellow man and create the better world we all dream of.      In conlcusion, I think that there is not justifiable reason to abtain the future from learning from the past. We can create our future and we can know what has happened so it doesn;t happen again. Society and the world has changed and all of us need to change with it so that creators of media can do so without fear of what might happen and be able to know that it will be accepted and treasrued for all to see now and in the future"
1,"People throughout society today are exposed to censorship due to movies, music, books, and other similiar materials. Today's young people know more about censory than many of us knew about in the earlier years. Parents educate their children on contraceptives and illegal habits and other situations that will appear throughout the human society. But, not all of the parents take the time to do that for their children, that doesn't mean the child doesn't get educated. Schools and other corporations take the time to teach young adults about situations that will eventually come up in life. If you think about it, people are not the only place to find out about censorship though. Public libraries contain books, movies, music, and internet access where an individual can obtain many facts about certain ideas, topics, or even just personal questions. But, should this be a place where we can go and find out about certain things without parental permission.      @CAPS1 is a period of time where we all go through the phase where we question things and become curious about things that @MONTH1 be happening around us or just throughout the world. Children go through the phase where they should know about personal intercourse between opposite sex, or the dangerous medications or the illegal substances that can cause major danger. Lets perhaps think, should each and everyone of us have free resources that allow young adults and even children explore on such topics. Different families and individuals people have their own outlooks on specific things. Religion @MONTH1 take huge part in someone's life, which restrict them from certian circumstances. Today's world has changed enormeously from twenty years ago. The resources were not as available to all of us as they are today. In my perspective i believe that we should be exposed to the censorship but @CAPS1 are times when a limit should be set.      Public libraries give the public the chance to research and read, and watch about an umlimited amount of resources. @CAPS1 is a certain circumstance where finding things out should not be as easy as it is. Although, the facts that are out @CAPS1 are not always the complete truth, which @MONTH1 lead certain individuals in the wrong thinking about a certain situation. The internet and technology has brought us so far, many of us rely on this resource. Not always does this lead us to the correct facts, which misleads us and leaves us with wrong thinking. Parents have an idea of what they want their children to learn about and what they want to wait to teach their kids about. The saying '@CAPS1 is a right time for everything', fits this situation very well. Ages come along and the older you are the more responsible you can be.      Books have allowed children and even toddlers to become exposed to curse words and intercourse and situations where they should not have the chance to discover at such a young age. We all think well the library isn't the only place where children are exposed it is the people throughout this world, but if we could cut down one resource where they could have limits on what to research and explore than it would suit the communities benificial. Children get caught up in places and habits at such an early age, but in order to manage the number of children who go through this we need to take pride in ourselves and have the nerve to stand up to all the rest of the adults and bring this issue to eye. The books that are put out with such topics such as illegal substances or intercourse or curse words should only be available to children at an appropriate age. We need to take the time and realize that maybe we do need to bring this situation to the attention of the adults throughout each community to give them the chance to put a better input on our children these days.      These extreme censory should be limited and not just put out for people of all ages. I believe that we do need to go through experiences but @CAPS1 are children getting pregnant at the age of @NUM1 and kids doing drugs in early years of middle school. We adults have possibly allowed these habits to become exposed to the younger generation when they have done nothing but influenced the children with a bad habit. The small things that we do not think about are the ones that put the most impact upon the young people. I understand that they want to explore and have the life experiences to learn from, but these past twenty years has changed so much that it is hard to believe.      @CAPS1 are parents who cuse infront of kids which gives the child the thought of it being alright. Well news flash children and young adults should not be using this language or have those type of reactions to situations. Many children learn it from the people that they are around, the books they read, the media they watch and now basically it is available to all. Information is easy to get ahold of these days. This society should come to realization that the time has come where we need to take a stand and do the young generation a great deed in the benefit and show them what is truely right and less dangerous. Some children are headed down a hard road and each child needs a motivation and a person to be @CAPS1 when they get caught in these situations. We all need someone to help us understand our wrong doings. But the censorship needs to come to a limit, and not be so available to just anyone. Things need to change and without the reacting of the older individuals we can not help this change. Lets take a stand and do what is right and beneficial"
1,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the @CAPS1  finds offensive. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live.     A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. If they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.      If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @NUM1 or rated @CAPS2 movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the @CAPS1.The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.      In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive @MONTH1 be different then what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in @MONTH1 not be the right thing in another familys view. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated @CAPS2 movies. If you took all the rated @CAPS2 movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @CAPS2 movies. What my family believes @MONTH1 not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offenesive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies.     In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age appropriate. Just as in @PERSON2's quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the @CAPS1 has to follow"
1,"Censorhship should play a major part in which books should enter and leave the library. Thats why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or cd should deffinitly should be removed from the shelf if it is found offensive to atleast ten children. Now it would be asking too much to have the libraian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about. So therefore a library should have a certain section that if a libraian thinks that there might be some bad language or refrence to drugs or alcohol then that book should go into that part of the library. I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I dont think a little kid should be reading but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the libraian.      Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for. Just because the movie has a title that dont seem that bad dont mean that there wont be any grapic images in that movie, or that there wont be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie. Now since movies are alot easier to review and since they also have a rating then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not. But there should deffinitly be a part in the library that if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room.      Music would be another thing you would deffinitly have to watch out for because with each song could change how the languge is in that cd. So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and persoanlly listen to that cd before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to. But personally i think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new cd album that an artist makes he could easily change how his wording is in the songs. So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music. One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words.      Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, cd's, or movies catagorized by age. As a child gets older he will be tought more about certain things. Then once he picks up that book and sees that its mentioned in the book it wont be that big of a shock to him or his parents. With the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence. So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence then there would be nothing left on the shelfs for kids to listen to or read.      Your not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or cd that has something to do with violence or alcohol use. But you can take some of the stuff that has alot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf. By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that @MONTH1 seem inappropriate for children will deffinitly make a big difference and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a cd and hears the artist metion something about that.      Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violene. So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf there would be no games left for kids to play. So there are just some things that contain violence that you just cant keep your child from seeing at one point in time. All the games have a rating on them so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game. By doing that you will be able to somewhat controll what your child will see and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available.      So I have pretty much covered about how who ever is in charge of the games, books, movies and cds should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf. You dont have to censor everything but there are deffinitly some things out there that should not be put out on the shelfs for little kids to look at or listen to. And if a little kid wants to get a game a parent should have to look at the game and the rating of the game to determine if that child is mature enough to handle what goes on in that game. But overall I personally dont think that they should just go through and ban everything from going on the shelfs it should be up to the child to determine if they can handle what that movie or book contains"
1,"'@CAPS1 @CAPS2'@CAPS3 in todays society are all about censorship. Whether that it be on television, books, news, etc. We all act like thing s are too bad to see when they really are not.     Different @CAPS3 have different beliefs on what something offensive is. some @MONTH1 take to offense what others @MONTH1 not. It is just all how you look at it, but no matter what, everyone will find something in their life that is offensive to them. To take a book off a shelf because it @MONTH1 have a few things that @CAPS3 @MONTH1 find offensive to them is appauling in my eyes. @CAPS3 are way too far away from reality in the @CAPS2 today. @CAPS3 are going to see things that offend them whether you like it or not. Think about magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@CAPS5.' some @MONTH1 find these magazines offensive but yet we do not care to take them off the shelf in fear of someone be offended.     Movies are a big topic that @CAPS3 are always onto. Even putting ratings on them warning @CAPS3 that this @MONTH1 offend you they still seem to have a problem with it. When do we draw the line and say that if it offends you then why bother to even look at it? If something truely does offend you then dont take the effort to make a point about it and just move on without making a big case over something that does not even have to go as far as it is going.      I do agree that we as americans @MONTH1 say and do things that will offend others. But taking entertainment off of the shelves just to please some few @CAPS3 it offends will not sit right in a lot of @CAPS3 eyes. The @CAPS2 is full of offensive things, and is full of @CAPS3 that will always have a say in what stays and what goes. It would be much easier for @CAPS3 to take a step back and realize that this is life and you can't have everything that you wish for. Citizens today need to get used to the '@CAPS6 @CAPS2' and find some meaning instead of sitting around complaining about things that @MONTH1 offend them. It is much easier just to walk away if you are offended then if you make a big deal over it.     Children growing up are going to see things and are going to hear things that maybe wrong for young @CAPS3 to hear. It is the @CAPS2 that we live in today, and you can not stop it even if you tried. Today, that is why they have age requirements that keep immature @CAPS3 from witnissing anything that is offensive. For example, in a movie theatre to see a '@CAPS8' rated movie, meaning restriced, you have to be eighteen years of age or older because that is the age you are considered to have an understanding of things and wont be offended over the small things. Yet, that is not good enough for @CAPS3 today. Now we want books, and movies taken off the shelf and having things taken off the news. What on earth is that teaching @CAPS3 now? @CAPS3 growing up will have no understanding, and will have their lives shocked the first time they ever see anything offensive if they are not exposed to it before hand.     My father's job has taught me to see things for how they really are and not try to see what i want to see. The @CAPS2 today is not going to do you any favors because @CAPS3 do not are about your feeling, but only care about what they find as entertainment. In today's society everyone and their brother wants to see something that really isn't there. Brain washed by what they want to see, @CAPS3 do not want to be offended, but it is going to happen whether you like it or not. taking books off of the shelf to save someone from having to deal with something that offended them in not right. It will only cause future problems for @CAPS9 with protest and start a fight that could have been avoided in the first place.     Why call it a free country if you dont even have the right to read something or see something because it @MONTH1 offend some @CAPS3? It is not fun to be offended but stopping it from happening is just not possible today.      All of the things i addressed in this message i really hope you take into deep consideration. If @CAPS3 dont want to be offended then dont watch, read, listen to what it is that offends you. Just walk away and act like it never happend. At such a young age i find that i have a great and detailed idea of being offended, mainly, because of what i have grown up around. I personally have not been @CAPS1 from many things, and I truelt believe that it has helped me become the person I am today. Someone who is not looking for something to please them or trying to hurt them. I'm just looking at the big picture in life and not worrying about the small things on the side that @MONTH1 offend some @CAPS3. I will leave you with one last thing to think about. Is taking the time to @CAPS10 all these things really worth the time to help the few @CAPS3 that are offended by whatever it is? Is it going to hurt us in the long run. My whole belief is based around that @CAPS3 live in a @CAPS2 and need to come to see the reality of it and not live in a little fairy tail land. Because it is not going to get any easier no matter what you '@CAPS10.'"
1,"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right"
1,"Have you ever found or seen books, music, movies, or magazines in a library that are offensive to you? If so, then would you have wanted to remove it off of the shelf so none of your children or anyone else that might have found it offensive, to see it? Well, I have actually gone to the library and seen some things that was offensive to me, and I have also heard my family members talking about it. So I am going to talk about what I have heard about my family seeing or finding books, music, movies, and magazines offensive. Also, I am going to explain how I felt and what i wanted to do when i seen those things in a library that was offensive to me. The last thing that I am going to talk about is how I feel on censorship in libraries.     First, I have been hearing from my sisters, my mother, and my step-mother about how they find some books, music, movies, and magazines at a library that was offensive to them. Now I do not know exactly what the books, magazines, etc., was that they found offensive but I do know what they thought about them and what they wanted to do. So one day, my sisters, mother, and step-mother was talking about a couple of books that she found offensive. They never said what the books were but they kept talking about how they felt and what they would have liked to do with them. Now she told my family and I that she was badly offended by what they were called and what they were about. Also she was saying that she would have really liked to have taken the books, music, movies, etc., off of the shelves, so other people that might have found them offensive would not see them. But, they all did also agree on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves. Their reason why they do not have that right is because of there are a lot of people who they do not know if they find it offensive or not. The people who do not find it offensive might actually want to read them. So, they just agreed to look past them and ignore what is there if it offends them for the people who do not find them offensive.     Now, from my point of view from finding or seeing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., in a library that are or was offensive to me. There have been a couple of times where I have walked in a library where I found a couple of books that was offensive towards me. I really did not like what the books were all about and called, and I really would have liked to take them off the shelves and throw them away so no other person who might have found them offensive would find them or see them. So what if there are other people who would have actually wanted to read those books? That was what I thought about when I was tempted to actually remove them. So I decided not to remove the books from the shelves, so the people who did not find them offensive could read them, if they wanted to. I respected the fact that there are other people that are out there that would want to read those books but at the same time, I knew that there are people who could find them offensive but I just thought that they would just ignore the fact that they are there.     So, on to the last thing that I am going to talk about. Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves, at a library, if they are found offensive? Also my views on censorship in libraries. Well I do believe that they should be removed so they wpuld not be offending anyone that walked into that library. But, if people had the right to remove books or anything that is offensive towards them, then there would literally be no books left in the libraries. Then there would not be any point in having libraries or in anyone writing books. So then again, I do not believe that any person should have a right to just remove the books that are offensive to them at all. I belive that if they find a book that is offensive to them, then they should just ignore that it is there and respect that there are a lot of people out there who would want to or like to read those books. So I do not believe that there should be any censorship in libraries at all. It is not anyones fault that people find books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive to them. So no, there should absolutely not be any censorship in a library.    So there, I have just explained my views on censroship in libraries and if I believe that people should have the right to remove books from a shelf just cause they found it offensive.  Like I have stated before, there should not be any censorship in libraries at all. But yes, I do understand that people find things that are offensive, but they should just ignore that they are there and respect that there are people who want to or would like to read those books. Once again, do you believe that people should have the right to remove a book from a shelf just cause they found it offensive, and what are your views on censorship in libraries?"
1,"Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too ? Your cousin believing in one thing,means you have to believe in it also? No,not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate.      Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere;in stores , in schools, inside, outside , they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about,that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it,well I say we don't.      Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked ,was of an offence to another , does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion.      I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one,it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they @MONTH1 see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong.      Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like,that is another person , anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us,so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We @MONTH1 not all agree with their way of life, we @MONTH1 not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another,so why should an item?      A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate,but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate,especially in the world we live in today.     If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile , and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like , and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives,have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too.      So just because I agree with everything I said , are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not,but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we @MONTH1 not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is,because it is what you live in and it is what you have,because with out it nothing would be anything.Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things"
1,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3. Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive? Think about @CAPS3"
1,"Should students, or anyone for that matter, be allowed to take offensive books, magazines, music, etc. of library shelves? No, students should not be allowed to take books off of shelves of libraries. If people took all the books off of the shelves that they thought were 'offensive', then there would not be any books left for the rest of the reading public.      However, there should be an age restriction as to when one can start reading or listening to that material. Take '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1', whose author still remains anonymous,for example. It was published right after the author, who kept it as a diary, died and was out on store shelves everywhere. That diary was written in the @DATE1's and was mainly discussing her drug addiction. At my school library, a student or faculty member must @CAPS2 to read the book due to the graphic and offensive @ORGANIZATION1 of the published diary. The book is simply left behind the counter, waiting for those students whom are mature enough to read it. If library faculty members get many colorful emails from parents portaining to the book that their child has just read, then they should take those books and set them behind a glass case.     Say that that librarian did @CAPS1 through all of the contents in the library just to satisfy everyone. Could one even satisfy the public by sorting through all of the books and removing the 'offensive' ones from the library? No, it simply could not be done. He or she would have completely wiped the library clean of all the books, magazine, movies, etc.. Is that really fair to the public that liked or loved some of those items? No. There are times where people are going to be offended by the @ORGANIZATION1 or content of the reading material. Why should one have to censor what they read or listen to just to satisfy others if the others do not have to read or listen to it? What happens if a student, that goes into the library every week, decides to reread a book that he or she has read several times before and he or she cannot find that book? He or she would not be able to reread that book due to the fact that someone did not like the content of the material. Again, is that really fair?      Now, say that that same librarian did remove all of the books that had offensive material in them. The regular flow of people coming in to check out books are going to be devastated to learn that a book they saw in the library just the other day was removed. The more the people are disappointed about the libraries, the more they are going to gossip. They are going to discuss how the library does not have any more books, music, etc.. They are going to tell all of their friends and relatives and people that they know to not @CAPS1 to the library. Soon, people would then start to visit the library less often until hardly anybody, if any at all, would visit the library. More and more people would resort to the @CAPS3 for research and books. The @CAPS3 is far more graphic then the library, in my opinion.     Everyone was born differently. People have different tastes in clothing, music, books, movies, etc. If there someone were wearing a certain type of clothing that I found offensive, would I @CAPS1 directly to that store and take it off of the clothes racks? The chances of that happening are slim to none. I simply have no right to take away something that belongs to the public just because it simply does not comply with my feelings and/or beliefs about the appearance of that peice of clothing. Now, if I read an incredibly offensive and graphic book, would I take it off of the shelves as well? Again, the chances of that happening are slim to none. Although, I probably would mention the selected book to the librarian and see if she he or she could put that somewhere for more mature readers.      I also think that if one does not like a certain genre that @MONTH1 be offensive, then that person should not read or listen to it. Just because that person thinks that that book or @CAPS5 is offensive, does not mean that the next person will find the book or @CAPS5 offensive. That person is not being forced to read it or listen to it. There is always going to be someone that @MONTH1 have different feelings that someone else. No two people are going to agree on everything or have the same opinion on something. It just simply goes against @ORGANIZATION1.     Honestly, I do not feel that books of graphic or offensive @ORGANIZATION1 should be removed from shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think, however, that they should at least have an age restriction or be placed where more mature readers can view them. People should all learn to respect one another and their opinions. All humans are created equal and people should just learn that opinions are normal in todays society. If that means that there are going to be offensive content in @CAPS7 libraries or any other country's library, then one should just have to learn to respect that. It takes all types of people and all types of opinions and views to make the world @CAPS1 round"
1,"The idea of censorship is indeed helpful in some aspects of literature, such as in the printing of school newspapers, yearbooks, and magazines. After a work has been revised, edited and displayed on shelves in communities, everyone has a right to read it, and authors have the right to keep it on the market due to thier freedom of speech. Censorship in libraries to avoid offence is not realistic. Also, anyone @MONTH1 find offence from anything they wish to be offended by, and therefore, if there are many people who are offended by what they read, libraries will be left with nothing. Finally, if someone realizes something will be offensive in what they pick up at the library, they always have the choice not to pick it up.     The idea of using censorship in libraries is unrealistic. Shelves would be left with nothing, and knowledge would not flow freely. Say that someone did not like @ORGANIZATION1 and decided to rid it from the library, the poetry, the stories, everything would be lost. Students could not use a library book to help them with school work, and anyone who wished to study @ORGANIZATION1's works in a deeper context, would not have the resources. Also, if something like @ORGANIZATION1 would be removed from libraries, scholars would lose their look into the past, unable to study the language of @CAPS1 society and the ideas and lifestyles formed there. Something like this example would happen with many books and magazines, @CAPS2 and music, leaving us with nothing, and with no insights to other thoughts and ideas. There would be no exposure to new ideas and therefore no chance to learn. Just because a few people might agree that a material is a bad read or @MONTH1 influence someone in an undesirable way, does not mean that it will be bad for all people. What it comes down to is a matter of opinion and what one does with the knowledge they collect from a certain material.     Secondly, there is the matter that people can choose what to be offended by. Depending on the values they want to keep and whether or not they are willing to be influenced a certain way, will change their view. Take, for example, religion. If an athiest walks into a library and decides the @CAPS3 is offensive, @CAPS4 will be left with nothing. @CAPS4 will not find the @CAPS3 offensive, but on the contrary will want to share its good news with people who haven't heard the story of @CAPS6 becoming man to save the people @CAPS7 loved with a passion incomprehensible to the human mind. There is no way to keep from offending someone through a work of litereature. Different backgrounds and ideas will have caused different people to have contradicting ideas. There is not one film, song, book, or magazine in which someone will not be offended. In a teen magazine, what one girl might see as helpful beauty tips, another girl might see as a message saying she's not pretty enough to be seen by a boy. She could change her views to something different so she might not be offended by an article about beauty. Being offended is a mind game. Do you want to be offended by a particular subject? Or can you approach it with a different point of view?     Finally, instead of the option to change one's views, a person has the option of not picking up an offensive piece of literature in the first place. Through their work, authors try to convey messages, and if the public decides they don't want to hear a certain message, they have the choice to not pick up the book and leave it for someone who does want to hear it. Authors do not worry about the people they offend, but rather hope they can reach out to someone through their words. If someone writes a bad review on a piece of fiction I wrote since I am an author, my first responce would be '@CAPS8 did you read it if you knew you wouldn't like it?' No one is left without the option of putting down a book once they've been offened. In ancient @LOCATION1, @CAPS9 offended many with the words @CAPS7 spoke, contradicting what they were being told about @CAPS6. @CAPS7 offered new ideas of a loving @CAPS6, a life in @CAPS12 with him for eternity where everything was as it should have been before sin entered the world. There is no denying that @CAPS7 offended people, and they could have chosen to stay home instead of flocking to hear him speak. They could ignore his movement and decide not to listen to what @CAPS7 had to say. A library should be like this. It should be a place filled with ideas, many ideas which some people @MONTH1 not want to accept. Therefore, everyone is benefited by having the choice to read what they want to read.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a ridiculous idea because there is no way to not offend someone. To find something that is not offensive to anyone would be impossible. Therefore, the best way to structure a library is with a plethra of choices, filled with offensive literature expressing ideas someone @MONTH1 not like. In the end, who knows? One might actually benifit from hearing some good news they thought was bad. Censored libraries would be doing no favors."
1,"There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone @CAPS4 a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what @CAPS5 it is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic.      People that say that they have offense to whatever the material @MONTH1 be usually use the phrase '@CAPS1 it's offensive and i don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then @ORGANIZATION1 (the writer of the song/book/movie) can claim that he @CAPS4 been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone one to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone @CAPS4 the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring @ORGANIZATION1 down, then @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as @CAPS1 take everything else down with it.     So, if some one finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If some one is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty rediculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book that to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there @CAPS4 a right to be sold.     On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author @CAPS4 written it this way. If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf. Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or where @CAPS5 it is played, then someone could be offending them in return. Having an open mind will let the so called 'offended person' see a whole other light being shown on why the 'offensive material' was even created. Then everything can stay ON the shelves!     People have opinions, and that is one hundred percent okay. But sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter. If some people get offended (or think they get offended) by something, they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores. But if they just sit back and think about it, then it would be okay. If they have a right to remove anything from the shelves, so does everyone. If that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 song really, really offends they, they should just change the radio station and forget about it. And if they have open minds as to why the things are still 'out there', then all the songs, and all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy. I do not approve of removing anything from stores just because one person feels like if they don't like it, then it absolutly @CAPS4 to go. No, they world doesn't just revolve around one person, and it never, @CAPS5 will."
1,"What kind of books are the children of our world reading now and days? Are the books they get ahold of age appropriate or the movie that they go and watch really what they think it is? Parents, teachers, and just regular citezens all over the world are asking themselves these questions almost everyday whenever they see their child reading a book with the front cover of a girl and a guy kissing or whenever their child is watching a movie thats pretty graphic. The next thing that needs to be asked is why, why are children at certain ages aloud to pick out this book or movie from a library and be able to take it home with them and watch and almost scar their lives forever from watching one simple movie or reading a book. Books and movies need to be reviewed so parents, teachers, and citezens don't half to ask why?      When you go to a library you expect to find different sections for different age groups of kids. Well sometimes if the kids are sent to the library alone they don't follow the guidelines of where they are suppose to be getting their books from. That's exactly when children of such young ages pick up book, movies, magazines, etc. that they shouldn't be picking out. Their needs to have be certain age requirements on different books because to many kids now and days are learning and hearing about different things that they shouldn't be hearing about. Either a parent needs to go with the child when they go to the library or the person who checks the book outta the library needs to check the book. If people can't even check what kind of book they are giving to a little child then they need to be taken out of the library. Those kinds of books and movies that are being given to little kids need to be banded from the library or put in a special place where young children can't get ahold of them. Books, movies, magazines, etc. need to be reviewed before putting them on the shelf, especially if it is going to be in the reach of a little kid. Even though the cover might look age appropriate doesn't mean the words on the inside are.     I can remember myself one evening, my little cousin was over at my house and we were just talking. I had made the mistake myself about having a show on tv that wasn't appropriate for her age. My little cousin started to talk to me about things that I myself that was bad to just randomly blurt out and talk about. My little @NUM1 year old cousin was talking to me about sex. I had to ask her where she was hearing or even learning this kind of information from. She flat out told me that she had read a book from the library at school that was talking about all that kind of stuff. I was appalled to hear that even at a school library there were books that consisted of talking about things that adults should be talking about. Books like that should be taken out of school libraries for good and be put in a more responsible place. I understand, yes that having books like that in a public library in a top shelved area where a little kid couldn't reach it or maybe a high school library is ok because kids at that age understand what that kind of stuff is, but when it becomes a time when a elementary school kid talks to you about that either from reading a book or watching a movie from a library that's when it needs to be taken care of!     So yes, I agree @PERCENT1 that if the person putting the book on the shelf isn't going to take the time of day to overlook the book or watch the simplest movie before they put it out for the public to be exposed to, then the book shouldn't go on the shelf at all! You never know what will be on the inside of those books. Kids don't deserve to half to sit there and read or watch a movie over things that they don't need to know about. Even myself as a teenager find things like that offensive to see in a magazine or movie, never the less a @NUM1 year old in elementary school that still has a life to live. I might be @NUM3 years older that my @NUM1 year old cousin, but i still believe that items that include offensive behaviors or fowl language should not be available! I feel that everyday I can walk down the hallways and just hear people talking about what they watched or read and most of the time it includes offensive things.     So in conclusion, I believe that items that are marked as offensive to anybody should be taken off the shelves and put into storage away from the world. Even if that one book or movie is to be told a number one hit, it needs to be taken off the shelves to save little kids and even teens from having to deal or hear about those items. Take it off the shelf or don't put it up at all!"
1,"Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another"
1,"Dear @CAPS1,      @CAPS2 name is @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3, and I believe that the censorship in libraries is in great need for improvement. Personaly I do not believe that the books and magazines that are in the library should be compleatly removed, but something needs to be done to keep the children away from the things that are not appropriet for their young minds. Children, in this age, are exposed to much more than they should be; through the internet, magazine adds, television, music on the radio, and now even some books. Their are many ways for the censorship in libraries to be improved upon, including; keeping things that are consitered offensive away from children, keeping children's minds focused on alternative healthy activities for their age groups, and having an area for just adults, where the materials we do not want our children around can be kept.     When you go to any public library you expect things to be family friendly, and that it will be a healthy environment to take your entire family into, including your children. An excellent way to keep children from even thinking of picking up something that they should not pick up, is to not give them the option. If children never see the book in the first place their is no way that they are going to want to look at it. Keeping adult books, magazines, television programs, and music out of childrens sight and mind involves much more than just putting the book up high on the top shelf, it also involves advertising. When libraries and book stores are trying to encourage you to pick up a copy of the latest book they received they do so by putting it on display, and advertising to their customers that they now have a new book, that is a great read for everyone. Children are very influential, especially the younger they are, and with that kind of advertising it would be very easy for them to want to read that book, just because their is a sign outside of the library which said it was a 'must read' or that it is 'great for people of all ages!'      @CAPS4 way to encourage the cencorship of public libraries is to keep childrens minds focused on better options. If the public library had a childrens area with games, toys, music, fun childrens books, and even story time it would be much more enjoyable for children to go to the library. Even if the parent of a child is interested in reading a book that they do not feel is appropriete for their child then they could go find the book elsewhere while their child is happily playing with all of the games, toys, and childrens reading options that have been given to them. I know from experience how difficult it can be to tell a child no. If a child see's a book on display that they try to pick up, it can be very difficult to tell and convince them to put the book back, but in a children's area that would not be a problem. Parents could take their children to the library and no longer have to worry about their child trying to pull every book off the shelf, and what is going to happen if they flip open a book to the wrong page and see some words that they should not be looking at.          In addition to having a childrens area I believe that it would also be beneficiary to have an area just for adults. Their are obviously adults are are interested in the books that we are trying to keep from our children, or they would not have wrote them in the first place. I think that it is unfair to compleatly prevent people from reading what they want to just because we do not think it is appropriet for young children. People obviously want to read those books, look at those magazines, and watch those television programs and just beacause we do not see it as appropriet for little children does not mean that it is wrong for a grown adult to read a book if they chose to do so. There are many classic novels such as @PERSON1's, To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6 that would be seen as offensive in a public library just because of the language used in the novel. Personally, it would just not be right to keep all those classic novels, from everyone.  If their was a part of the library, such as a separate room, or a coffee shop that held novels that were flagged as innapropriete or offensive to young children it would greatly benefit the library and the citizens who went their.      Are you tired of always trying to keep your child from pulling a book off the shelf that you know if full of bad words? Their are many ways to keep certain materials away from children, aside from compleatly pulling them off the shelf. If all public libraries, kept certain materials away from children, had an area specificly designated for children, and an area just for adults it would make people much happier. Thank you for taking the time and consiteration to read @CAPS2 letter, your interest is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, @ORGANIZATION1"
1,"Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for."
1,"Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries.     The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population.     Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others.     In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain.     As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves"
1,"I think it is offensive if there is a bad book or music or magazins on the shelf ya i would report it because i would not like my son,daulter/nice,nephew reading about things at a young age. I think what they should do is make a kid section like @NUM1 and adult section @NUM2-elderly people I think that would be a good idea because then all the little kids and teenagers do not have to learn bad things in books or magazins or even through music i know it would be hard to do that because these days little kids are learning bad things through there parents or just by learning and look at other peolpe.      If we can go to a librare that has those sections in ages it would be easer on kids because half of the time you learn new thingsin life through a book or mucis or even through a lkids and a life time magazins. Music these days are bad any more there is nothing but bad word's in a song and when you are trying to lissen to it with your kid around or the kids you babysitting for they would hear the bad word that the girl/guy just said in that song they would be askin and ? about what is that word and you have to tell them you would understand when you get older. thats why it is inmportent to seperat the seactions in a libraries so little kids dont have to hear those bad things ever were you go and I think its knda dumb to have bad words in a song sometimes because half of the time your kid is with you and there just learning bad words all the time so I think they should just keep that out of songs.      In moves sometimes there is porn,bad lanuga,and smokeing,and ect... any more you kids can't whatch moves with you because there is eather smokeing drugs are in a move or there is some porn in the move depends what move you are wahtching thoough and all most ever move has to have bad lanuga on it. If i am wahtching a move with my nice/or nephew i have cover there eyes sometime because i do not want them to see how people do drugs or people have sex or people saying bad things now these days thats all there is sometimes to even make a move and it is just not right. Any more I have to watch kids moves with them because I do not want my nice and nephew to grow up and be like people in moves i want them to grow up and have a life and not be like othere people but there selfs thats why its also verey inmportent to put those moves in the adult area at the librarie.      In books there are so many books you can choose whatever you want to read but sometimes little kids they like to read and look at pictures and sometimes in books there are bad things to look at or just a bad book peiord thats why they should also be seperat too because you have your kids books and you have your adult book in my eyes i dont think a kid should be reading a big book untill they are at least @NUM2 or so so thay can understannd whats going on and ever thing like that. I never hear from people that books can be bad for kids really books are books and sometimes when kids get a book they don't even read it all the way or they don't even read it at all they just sit there and look at it. They should also be seperat though kids should get there kids books and adults will get there books.      I think it is verey inmportent to seperat kids books,music,magazines,moves and ect.... kids just need to learn about kids things till they are old enough whtch is like in there teens like @NUM2 or so then they can start learning about big things in the adult section for big people the reason why I said @NUM2 is because they are old enough now to understand now whats going on in the @DATE1's world not what's going on in the kid section they are a teen now and they cann start taken responbilltys now and doing things on there own and learing new things on there own now thats why ever there should be seperat because kid need to learn about kid things and us big kids can learn grown up things that's why everthing should be seperat in a librarie or any where really in storis ect....that's why it is inmportent for me.      I think bad thing's should not be in moves/music it is just hruting are little kids and it's teaching them how to do bad think's and how to say bad think's I don't think that is a verey smart idea to do is let are kids lissen and whatch thing's like that when need to teach them how to say good thinks and teach them how to good thinks not bad."
1,"History is bond to repeat itself right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up.      The effects of what @MONTH1 come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past. The @ORGANIZATION1 prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read?      I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and @PERSON2 read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. @PERSON2 said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library.     This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on; because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1 grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too. But, my point is they should have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool.      By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives. Just like how @ORGANIZATION2 has a new song out. The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them.      Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1 accomplish something no one else has. To show the world @LOCATION2's youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true.      If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' @LOCATION1, or To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction. It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully.      Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the @CAPS3 series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines; about @PERSON1 who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for you life?     In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school. To go and learn what you already know"
1,"The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that poeple wish that there kids or even there on self did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call eachother. People all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live.      Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on there life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling becasue they are afriad of what would happening. Then in the long run telling after they get pregant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel so relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it couls be all that one person that did not like it fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good Author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but truns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.     I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her ipod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like. She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that poeple do not like. Either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get there songs from there.     There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artics now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use there brains. No one can stop them. Not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio.      In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life.      So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for thier little girl or there teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the self. Keep playing the some music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over agian. So keep the books on the shelves. That the radio play. Just be safe in doing it."
1,"A dumber society, a worse society, an author's voice being taken away, and a society that cannot find happiness.  These are all effects of what happens when you censor literature, and it is why I believe that no matter the circumstances, literature, be it in books, music, magazines, or any other form of expressing an opinion, should never be censored.  As a collective group of individuals, we can always learn something from every one book.  Books like '@CAPS1 @NUM1' can provide us insight into societies that we would not want to live in, but insight into how not to enter into a society like this.  No matter what, most books in this world are going to offend at least one person, so if we follow the concept of censoring books, then we would end up with no books to read, as @PERSON1 stated in her quote.  The ability to read whatever book you want is a fundamental one to learning more about other societies, as well as our own.     If more books were to become censored, the world would be a much worse place.  Our children would have less material to go over, books would only highlight our own society, not some other society we can not start down the path of.  Additionally, the banning of specific books makes them more intriguing to some readers to read.  If a book is banned, it is going to quite possibly have more people trying to find a way to read it, which would achieve the opposite result of what the 'banner' (for lack of a better term) wanted it to achieve.     The less books that are banned, the better off our society will be today and later down the road.  Without any books being banned, our society opens up to new ideas that can either improve our current society, as well as to see how we do not want our society to be.  '@CAPS1 @NUM1' is regarded as being one of the more influential books of the @DATE1, despite having been a banned book at times since it was written.  Being able to read '@CAPS1 @NUM1' gives readers an insight into what life would be like in a society without books, a possible society of the future.  This enables us to be able to see the road we could be heading down as a civilization, and it is especially applicable now with the advent of the @CAPS4 and advancement of the television.     One other point I would like to make on the subject of banning books is that it takes away the author's voice.  Each and every one of us, being humans that walk this @LOCATION1, have the same right to be able to have a voice, and to say whatever our hearts desire us to say.  Banning a book would take away that voice, take away what that person has to say, and that, in my humble opinion, is a very bad, and very wrong thing to do.  If a person does not have a voice, how can we expect him or her to be a contributing member to society?  If we censor a person's voice, that person's contributions go by the wayside, unnoticed by many people.  How would you feel if your voice was taken away?  We live in a world where nobody should have their voice taken away, and historically, banning books has been a way of doing this.     Without certain books, we would not be able to learn as much about the outside world.  For example, if there is a book the government of our nation does not want us to read, the learning that could come from that book is lost, and we fail to pick up what could be crucial knowledge.  What if your favorite book was censored?  Everything you have learned from that book would suddenly leave your brain, as you would have never read the book in the first place.  Books teach us things about us, they teach us things about the world, and all books have some sort of benefit to reading them.  By censoring a book, you take away the possibility of this benefit to the reader, and you make it impossible to gain this benefit.  Additionally, you could be limiting the happiness that comes with reading a specific book, which is something that a person should never have taken away from them, the ability to be happy, which is truly all most of us want in life.     As you can see, censorship can have many, many negative effects on society, including, but not limited to, a society that does not learn as much, society not realizing good or bad ideas, and the limiting of a person's voice, a person's knowledge, or a person's happiness.  These are all effects of censorship, and they should speak for themselves as to why book censorship is bad.  But if that is not enough to convince some people, I will conclude this essay with a question.  How would you feel if your voice was taken away by your work being censored?"
1,"Censoring Books in the @CAPS1      Have you ever went into a local @CAPS1 and found a really interesting book or movie that @MONTH1 in some way offend someone else? Many people have done this, and a lot of the things that people @MONTH1 like @MONTH1 be something that should be censored so others wont feel uncomfortable. I think that the libraries should keep all things on the shelves, but when someone wants to check something out they should have to be responsible for anything some @MONTH1 say if they get offended at something they are reading, and everyone who gets offended should realize that most likely its not done on purpose. By doing this I think that people would eventually get use to the idea and it would become a second nature to people that visit the @CAPS1. If we actually try to do this good things could happen and bad things can be prevented.     Books are not the only thing that can offend someone there are many other things like music lyrics, art, book covers etc. When people go to check out different things in the @CAPS1 most likely they are not thinking that it would offend someone, it could just be something for recreational purposes.  I personally think that children should not be allowed to check something offensive to people out of the @CAPS1 unless a parent is giving there child permission.  I think this should be done because most likely when a child finds out that something they have is making someone angry, they will use it against that person almost every time. Almost anything brought from anywhere can offend someone and most people dont even know it because it is not done intentionally.     Some things that can easily offend someone are things that have to deal with religion, ethnicity, slavery, ku klux klan, powerful ones, presidents and many other things.  All these topics can be checked out at any @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 go to.  An example of this can be when a child in grade school or even an adult in college have an assignment on something to do with slavery and racism back in those days.  Most likely they will have to do research and check out books on these things to complete the assigned task; the @CAPS1,a great cash friendly place to go get the information, can be of a major assistance in providing them with anything that they @MONTH1 need to fulfill this task.  Now that they have their information they take there resources back to class and lets say an @CAPS2-@CAPS3 student gets offended at the cover of a book on slavery because it is showing a @CAPS4 person being abused; later a @CAPS5 gets offended because of a poem about how they treated blacks back in the days.  They apparently dont think those things should be in these books and thats a personal problem on their part because no one was looking to offend them.  Now everyone in the class is offended and causing chaos all over simple books allowed to exit the @CAPS1 with someone who had no intention of offending anyone. These books are of help to everyone, and most likely the people should know whats done on purpose or intentionally and when someone is simply completing an assignment or even reading just to learn more on the subject,they should know they have nothing to do with them.      It is not the libraries job to monitor who checks out what and why they want to read something and to be sure that all the books in there viscinity are not offensive to people because it is impossible to know the answer to all those questions.  The librarians do not have the time to make sure no one will get offended over something because they dont know how every single person feels about any certain item. Just like the example of the school assignment there would have been no way the person checking those books out would have known the class would get upset over something that occured many years ago and no longer taking place.  It is up to the ones reading these books and getting offended over things to straighten matters on their own. Eventually the problem would slowly go away if everyone works together.      To answer this statement honestly I say No I dont think the @CAPS1 should censor anything and they should not have remove any peice of literature of any sort from the shelves.  This is cleary a problem that the individuals themselves should be accountable to get over and realize the obvious fact that no one person is checking books out just to offend them as an individual. They are the ones having the problem so they should be the ones that have to work hard to not get offended over these small very minor occurances simply because someone is reading something that happened years ago. It is our job to fix this problem if we are the ones getting offended not the libraries"
1,"I believe that censoring certain things would not be wise a thing to do. My reasonings behind this are such, that it is impossible to censor life so why attempt to do the imposssible. My second reasoning is that it is the duty and responsibility of the parent and or legal gaurdian of a child to choose what they should and should not read, listen to, or watch, not the public library and or people's. My final reason is that it is no one's right to take away the rights to allow someone to listen to something or watch something, it is their @CAPS1 given right and their constitutional right to choose what they want and have it their way.     The first reasoning behind not wanting to censor cultural items, such as books, music, movies,ect. is that censoring life is unreasonable and impossible and all of these items are apart of everyday life. Books and movies have always dabbled on the edge of risque. They have always expressed topics or ideas too outlandish and unreformed to certain individuals, but these pieces of visual and literary imagery are parts of our @CAPS2 culture. These items express the very individuality and rebelious nature our fine nation was founded upon. I recall various sitiuations inwhich movies and music have been edited of tweeked to make it so someone will not be offended. This tweeking and changing does not assist in the bringing about of a new and frontier world it merely puts the old and free and expressive world in the dark. By taking out the ideas and items seen as 'controversial' you take away greatly from the learning factor for various individuals, you strip them of some of the key items that lead to a successful and avid learning experience. One instance I can think of that is completly outlandish is individuals attempting to take 'under @CAPS1' from the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5. The very thought of censoring @CAPS1 from our  nation's @CAPS4 is an insult to the founders and all they stood for.     My second reason is that personal censorship for children is the responsibility and duty of the parent or legal gaurdian.So many times has censorship,for youth, fallen upon the shoulders of the everyday individual when infact it is not their issue to deal with. It is the parent's job to let their child know what would be acceptable and unacceptable for them to view, read, or listen to. Now adays there are numerous songs,movies,and books that can be construde as 'outlandish', but it is not the responsibility of the everyday person to have to take the very things that they enjoy out of their lives because certain types of culture are unsettling to individuals,such as children. If such items are so awful for adolescents to hear or be exposed to parents should not allow them to be around it. They should have tighter control over what their sons or daughters are being exposed to if they belive such things can be harmful to their children's up bringing.     My third, and final reasoning, is that whose right is it to take away another person's wants or certain things they enjoy. This country was founded upon a speficic set of guidelines allowing various things to be spoken,written, and showed. It would be an insult to the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 wishes for some individual to come in and take another persons rights away as though they are somehow better than they are. The documents this fine nation were founded on state that every man is created equal, that no one man has any leway over another. The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 set down these specific guidelines to ensure that no one would be higher in opinion or controlling strength than another. They did this to ensure the nation as a whole would ultimately prevail despite opposite opinions and opposing thoughts. I personally do not believe in censorship because it would tear apart this country's very foundations,and when you do tear a fine house's foundation the supporting beams and the rest of the house will follow. What I mean is that by crumpling the ideal that this country's @CAPS7 states would ultimatly lead to a host of other issues that would have people wanting other things changed and more change and change begetts change and more change and very soon we would look at this country and not be able to recognize the face that we saw.     In conclusion, I believe we should not censor the content in movies, music, or literature. My reasonings behind this are censoring life is unreasonable and impossible, it is the parent's of legal gaurdian's job to choose what their children are and arent exposed to, and itis no ones right to take other peoples wants from them. The ideas passed down by our @CAPS8 @CAPS9 designated freedon to write and say until our hearts content, censoring the literature, music, and movies that make up this fine country's cuture would be a great disrespect to them and their honor."
1,"To the newspaper edits,Should books, music, movies, magzines, and other reading materials, be removed if the materials are view to be offensive?     I do not think that is a good idea. Reasons why is that just like what @PERSON1 an Author (in the last sentence) said if we remove books from shelfs there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. That is true because I am sure there are lotts of books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people but maybe the readers who get offensive do not understand the materials that they read. For example the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem, maybe the reader who gets offensived about those types of topics just do not understand it or @MONTH1 not get it.      An other reason why could be because we are in america, and the last time I checked we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. Its fair to say that because well, it is true we has people of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind. And just because the topic of the reading material offensives them does not mean you can take away the writers material. Doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth. If the reader has the right to say what in on your mind then what is the maining of being free to write what you wish to write. If you can see where I am coming from it takes a lott not to talk to a teacher or someone in a highter postition from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you can not ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me' it is the same if you remove the book from the writer.     Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because has humans we always are willing to learn something new, by @CAPS3. When a person reads they always learn something new. It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammer, the diffrent styles of writing, or know more about the topic. @CAPS3 in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then @CAPS3 something fun? can not think of anything? well it is because @CAPS3 has a big role in our lives.     Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it @MONTH1 make other reads feel like they are not alone. Like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story base on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved @CAPS5 and how to deal with it. Just picture it two @CAPS4 girls, @CAPS5 is mad at herself  and at the world and hates a tape about angles. While the other @CAPS4 girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angles makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved @CAPS5 is in a good place. Now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or leaved out. When you take away a material like a small tape from the librarie's shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the reader's too.     Finally the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelfs is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likly that the topic is still there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the @ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do delete all of that? it is not reality. And if that could even happening which is unlikly that it would people can still talk. And there is nothing that can stop people from talking. 'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are explambles of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dont like is still out there.     I understand that reading some materials @MONTH1 offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on.The reader @MONTH1 not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about. And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @MONTH1 end up likeing it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not  learn it."
1,"You Can't @CAPS1 That On @CAPS2     I don't think that certain materials should be moved from shelves because others don't like them. To speak bluntly about it I would have to @CAPS1 if you find it offensive deal with it. We still have that right as @CAPS3 citizens don't we? Once more, why should others have to miss out on something that could potentially help them in some way just because you see its vulgar?      To go into depth I would like to state that what people believe to be offensive to others was created by an immature society. It is a wonder why we don't know everyone in the world personally seeing how everyone likes to get into others business. Hypocrites are the only people who would be supportive of something such as this. If you would let me take it deeper; you can find fault in any and everything the world has to offer if you look for it. But who would be the inconsideraste narcasistic asshole to do such? I'll explain who.     You might've heard of the recent @PERSON2 incident if not I'll elaborate. @PERSON2 was going to be on the childrens show @CAPS4 @CAPS5. As a childhood fan this was a very big deal to her she explained it as being probably the best thing to happen to her. But while shooting the show @PERSON4 wore a strapless sundress and someone became 'offended.' The show was never released and her dream of being on one of her favorite childhood shows was crushed. Parents @CAPS1 she was too suductive and her clothing could be chalked up as too sexual for children. Yes, that is what I said you don't have to reread it. My argument is this; if I wanted to be ignorant and trash @CAPS2 I could very easily do it. Some examples of this are as follows. @PERSON1 is way too sexual for a cartoon movie with a @NUM1 rating. Ariel the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be changed immediatly because she only wears clam shells over her breast. Tinkerbell's attire should be changed because her dress is way too short. @PERSON3 the iconic female cartoon character looks like a prostitute.      All of the characters above are characters seen by children or are well know be children and adults. What is the difference between them and @PERSON5? Some mighjt @CAPS1 for one she's not a cartoon character but we do have a word for people who have a fetish for cartoon characters. I won't go into more detail on that but just know it makes no difference. No one would even dare to tell @CAPS8 that their characters can be seen as vulgar and not very child friendly. So neither should @PERSON2 be said to be vulgar. If you haven't already become offended and are still reading allow me to shower you with more interlectual reasons. I like to call these reasons common sense.      My first reason is the same sundress that @PERSON4 wore is being sold in children sizes. So it's ok when a child wears it, hell you could probably @CAPS1 its cute. But when a woman wears the same dress you @CAPS1 it's sexual. What kind of insolent moronic thing is that? If the dress is seen as sexually explecit when women wear it then it is no longer fit to be worn by @CAPS6 girls.     My second reason is that @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a childrens show. This means none of those children are going to pay attention to how sexy the cast is. They are going to be enjoying the humor, lights, and music. And anyone who tries to @CAPS1 otherwise is the exact definition of the word idiot. I don't remember most of the episodes of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 let alone what the characters were wearing.     And my final reason is you have to be some kind of pervert to watch a childrens show just to see how the women look. That is the prime example of having no decentcy or morals. This also tells me how hypocritical these parents are. This means they went to the show and instead of listening to the message that was being sent they had their eyes all over @PERSON4.      In conclusion I would have to @CAPS1 no one has the right to judge others by any means. Now am I saying you should be able to go to your local library and rent some pornography; not at all. But I am saying is people need to stop trying to be some uptight about simple things. Nothing in this world is done without reasoning this goes double for books, movies, magazines, and music. No one will write a book just to write it. There is always a meaning to it and for you to try and take that book off of the shelves because it offends you sickens me. Bottom line if you find it offensive deal with it within your family. Don't try to speak for everyone and don't try to censor everyone"
1,"Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology.     A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that @MONTH1 interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want.     Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they @MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought.  Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn.  By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn.     We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology.  However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library.    Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish."
1,"In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information. All of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. Byt what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? What if some of this information changed the persective of peoples' lives, and who people are? Libraries do contain offensive and provokative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings. Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @LOCATION1 come from many different places making the @LOCATION1 very diverse. One thing in a book @MONTH1 not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. Magazines, movies, books, etc. should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain @CAPS1 whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgable assistance to help what people are looking for.     Sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located. In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's @CAPS1 is that it seperates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one. Children normally have a seperate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from. An example of a bad situation would be if their was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. The children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking. This is common sense. Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well.     Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that their are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. Asssistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it. Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. Everytime I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for. They warn me about offensive or provokative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect. Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc.      Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provokative. Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to read whatevery they please. Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out out of peoples' mouthes are useful no matter how rediculous it is. Even if it is the most rediculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. This would be more on opinion based writing. In factual righting, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.This brings me to my persepective on the matter that I think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books"
1,"Censorship, and the lengths of such, has been a heavily debated topic for years. Nowadays, we have cd's with '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' stickers, warning adults of the proclaimed 'damage' the material might have on a young, unbiased mind.      Let's take it back to the days when you weren't afraid to let your child walk down to the grocery store. Those lovely days when, 'I @CAPS3 @CAPS4,' episodes showed @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 sleeping in completely seperate beds. Back then, there wasn't as much to worry about right? So why @CAPS6 bring back that kind of censorship? I'll tell you why bringing back strict censorship or even taking risque materials off the shelf is @CAPS6 a good idea.      In today's society, one might argue that our youth are being brought up in 'gross' environments. Our youth are exposed to many vulgar ideals, and concepts each day. Yet, if you had the chance to homeschool your child, monitor their television exploits, and restrict them from ever entering into the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 without supervision, how prepared would your child be for the shocking and ever roaming @CAPS7 of vulgarity and backlash that we all know is out there?     Everyone knows that really religious family where their kids are angels, and where the @CAPS10 @CAPS11 is the most inspiring classic of all time. But, let's also take a closer look... I hope you realize that when those children are set free into the @CAPS7, they are going to be so overwhelmed with the concept that, people @CAPS12 don't do the right thing, on purpose! This could transpire into @NUM1 @NUM2.      The young adult, or adolescent will be so compelled by their newfound freedom of choosing from right and wrong for themselves that they @MONTH1 @CAPS12 choose the wrong choice just to see what effect it will @CAPS12 have!     Think about it, if your entire life has been choosing to do the correct thing, @CAPS6 for yourselves but because your parents never gave you the chance to choose wrong, what would you do? Would you @CAPS6 be curious as to what the wrong choice could do? And furthermore, if you always chose to do the correct thing, and got a positive response out of it, would you @CAPS6, @CAPS6 realize that choosing to do the wrong thing could @CAPS12 give you a negative @NUM3.      The child - initially realizing how many indecent people there are in the @CAPS7- could be very easily swayed, and very easily manipulated.      This holds true to many scenarios, especially concerning drug and alcohol use. The childs easy ability to trust people could very well lead to an incident where they will probably trust the wrong people. Leading them further and further down the rabit hole and away from the morals that they were raised, and were comfortable with.@NUM1.           The adoloscent's revelation into the wrong deeds of the @CAPS7 could have effects of shock, disbelief, and dissappointment.      What once these children thought was genuine, kind, and beautiful, @MONTH1 and probably will turn out to be, generic, unthoughtful, and transpire from the wrong motives.      Would this @CAPS6 upset the young adult? Would this @CAPS6 confuse them and cause them to lose some faith in man? Yes. Now, back to the issue.     I believe, that if you were walking through walmart and just so happened to gaze down the shampoo isle, and suddenly! Your eyes are caught on a book to which the title is a curse word in big bold letters... You have every right to feel like you were unwantingly exposed to something that didn't really need to happen. It isn't right to reject the new and blasphemous ideals of the new masses, however it is right to say that, @CAPS6 everyone should HAVE to see it. However, places such as @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17 stores, and other places of that nature, should be allowed for those specific civilians that would seek it out. In terms of reading material as well, having a section blocked off in the store for explicit material should also be taken into consideration. It isn't fair to @CAPS6 warn the buyer of what they might be running into at the local bookstore.      So read up buttercup! Listen to your music! Watch your sci-fi television series, because, with as much violence that leaks out of it, @MONTH1 also rise to your ability to grow stronger as a person. To choose what is right and what is wrong for yourself. To create and build yourself up into whatever you want to be. It might just be the straw that breaks your back but, you know, if the straw never broke your back, you'd never fall down to recieve that time of rest. We all need to fall, to be tempted, and to proclaim triumph over our victories. My brothers and sisters, in this @CAPS7 of hate, and wrong doing, toughin your skin and show the @CAPS7 that you can grab everything they throw at you"
1,"Books enable the mind to go to work and allows the readers to use their imagination. But if books are taken away from these readers, how, then, can their minds be stretched and molded? How can they be introduced to new ideas and look beyond what is fact or fiction? The censorship of books denies the complete freedom of readers of all ages and prevents them from expanding and broadening their minds to new subjects and ideas. Literature is about expessing yourself and the censorship of books does not allow authors or readers to have that freedom.          As young children we read stories that have nice, happy endings and they always seem to have a moral to it. The world seems to be safe and life is easy. But as we begin to grow up, the challenges of life also grow and our choice of books and other reading material begin to expand. It is all a part of growing up. The books of our youth allowed us to use our imagination and the books of our later years allowed us to learn about and cope with reality. If our books were removed because they were found offensive, then how would we be able to see reality as reality? Censored reading materials prevent the world from learning about new things. You wouldn't take away health books in a health class because it goes into explicit detail about the facts of life. It is the right and choice of readers to learn about these things, not anyone elses. If a book is too offensivefor them, then they can choose to stop reading it. One book @MONTH1 not be the right book for one person, but it @MONTH1 be the right one for another person.          How does a person or group decide which books to take off the shelves? How can one book be more explicit than another? My sister is a fourth grader and she is reading the book '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 the past few days she has become very angry at the fact that they author uses explicit words. '@CAPS3 does the author use cuss words?' she asked me one day. '@CAPS4't he know that fourth graders are reading this?' I remember thinking the same way she did when I was her age, but then I realized that, as I grew up, the words that were said were only a part of life and will always be. If this book was taken off the shelf for fourth graders, then what books should be taken off for teenagers my age. I read 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6' a few months ago and the choice of words in this short novel was not very pleasent. I do admit I was a bit put off by many of these words, but it was a part of history. It is how they talked and acted back them. 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6' is a classic and the thought of taking it off the shelves would cause much contreversy. But if this book isn't censored, @CAPS3 are others? All books teach a valuable lesson whether it is wrong or right. 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6', no matter how much I disliked the language that was used, put me into that time in history and I was able to understand the feelings and the events of this book much better than if these words wouldn't have been used.      Literature is about expressing and freeing yourself. Literature gives you freedom, and choices. You have the choice to read fairytale stories to escape reality or you can read a @ORGANIZATION1 magazine if facts and nature interests you. Censoring books takes away some of this freedom for readers. Do you remember the little childrens toy that had a box with holes and you had blocks that were shaped to fit the holes? As a child, you learn which shape goes with which hole and as you grow even older, you learn what shapes these blocks and holes are. Well, taking away certain books is like taking away one of those blocks away from a child. If the child is not given that shape, it is not given the opportunity to learn that that shape goes in its designated hole. If a reader is not given the freedom of choice, then they will miss the opportunities to broaden their minds and learn about new ideas. How can a reader know if they like a certain genre of book, if only but one genre is presented to them?     Censoring books prevents readers from expanding their knowledge and they lose the ability to express themselves in a certain way. Censorship of books could start a process like that of a domino effect. If one book can be censored for one thing, then other books could fall into that same category. If there are no books left, then how can a person learn"
1,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away."
1,"Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have @ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at.     When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the @CAPS3 and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.     I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me.     I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary.     Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust."
1,"I belive that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found to be  offensive.  The main reason I say that is becuase there are not just postive things in this world ,but there are alot of negitves also.  It is very important for children to learn and understand the things that are going on in the world they live in reguardless if they are good or bad.  Everyone is going to have to learn about the things going on around them sooner or later ,so it is better to find it out as a child rather then later on in life when you might not have someone there to explain it all to you.       I understand, there are some age limits that should be inforced becuase of some of the fowl nature of them. Though at some point and time before a child becomes an adult they should know most of the basics of life no matter how positive or negitive. Children should not be shelter at a young age to just young adult things because they need to know what else is out there in the world.  For example, children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world.  If they dont understand that something bad could happen to them beucase they did not know the dangers around them because they never learned it.       When I was younger it was required to know other people out side of your race or religion beucase not just your race or religon is in this world.  Also we learned the diffrence between good and bad choices.  If us children did not learn that at an early age many of them would be in some very rough situations today.     On the other hand there is an extent the children need to learn also.  For example, say you buy a video game for your child ,but make sure you inforce to them that killing and shooting is not something that they should be doing out in the real world.  Make sure you teach them the diffrence between really and fakeness.  That is a main reason why kids today do not have self control becuase of the things they learn off of video games.     Now a days on @CAPS1 there are people being preasured by the media to act out of there charater just to get attation.  They are publicsizing sexual and inapproprate things for child to be learning about at a young age ,but they need to be aware that its out there and it is bad.  In magazines they will destorte famous peoples bodies to make them look like something they are not to make people feel like they are not good enough.  Children sould be taught that not eveything they see, hear ,and read are not always right or true.  With todays media and materials it is easy to know the diffrence between right and wrong ,but they put it out there as if one person is doing it it is ok for everyone to be doing it.  In most cases it is not until that person understand all of the facts about it and can make rashanal dessicions on there own and on there own time.     Children now a days will get  presured by media, magazines ,and sometimes by peers.  The media is telling them to do something that is not neccessarliy right ,but is popular.  You should not teach you children off of things like that it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on.  With todays magazines, the writers will make people look like something they really are not just to make them look good.  That is not fair to readers, the person that is being expoused, or the author themself.   Finally, with peer pressure today kids will see something off of television and try it then try and get there friends to do it even though they know it is not the right thing to do.  I belive that children, when they are faced with delimia's like these, should know right from wrong with the trouble they are faceing.  If they know nothing about it they need to walk away or learn how to say no reguardless of how hard it might be.      In conclusion, I believe that the children now a days that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it.  Also they should know the right ways to haddle it when they are put in certain situations.  Lastly, I believe kids should know what is going on around them so when they grow up they know how to fend for themselves ,and not be counting on someone else to tell them baisc things that are going on in the world around them."
1,"Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it"
1,"I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of."
1,"Libraries are a place in which information is stored. Students go there to reasearch for papers, adults go there to find books on how to improve something, such as their garden, or just the whole public as a whole goes there in order to obtain a book to read. Since libraries are a wealth of information, whether it be found or considered inappropriate and needed to be censored, the library should do its best to have various types of books and educational magazines, while, movies and other types of magazines are more subject to this censorship.     A libarary is meant to hold, at the very least, books. Books are one of the most original ways of spreading information, and keeping that information as true. However, when a book is published, it is considered to be aiming for a certain point or audience. There are the children's books, the young adult's novels, and the adult novels. Children's books are often kept in a separate section from the novels that are aimed towards adults, and for good reason. Children are often incapable of understanding what occurs in adult novels, and would be susceptible to inappropriate themes for their age group if the adult novels were placed on the same shelf. It isn't necessary to censor the or remove a book from a public library, when the book in question is capable of being moved to a different section. It's something so radically rational, that it is capable of happening, and of being so. Such as if the book were a @CAPS1, in an area that is made up of a majority of a religion that denounces the @CAPS1 as a whole, would it be right for the public library to remove it, on account of it being an inappropriate material? If it did, then there would be an outcry. The same with the @CAPS3, and @CAPS4'ran. It @MONTH1 not always be a religious text in question, it @MONTH1 just be a mature themed adult novel that's in question, but once the censorship has begun, where shall it end?     With magazines, there is a variety of different topics that are explored in them, where there isn't near as much so with books. Such as @ORGANIZATION1, a magazine dedicated to science and nature, often filled with articles and photos of scenes and ideas that aren't in many books. The @ORGANIZATION1 is a way that libraries can fill their shelves with science and nature,and even history without having to buy a large and much more expensive book. Although not all magazines are like The @ORGANIZATION1, they all considerably have their place. Other magazines, such as @CAPS5, lack the dearth of information and overall importance that educational magazines contain. Thus, subjecting them to be of less importance, and of also being more subjected to censorship. The library is going to be more open, at least it should be conisdering, that a magazine filled with tips about sex and how to dress the best for the upcoming winter is not what it needs, and also isn't the most appropriate of material. That is an understandable censorship, because in comparison, magazines are much more accessible than books are, which makes them easier for the general public to access.     Movies, however, are in a different scale. Many movies, if not a majority, are solely for entertainment. The movies that are considered to be documentaries generally don't do near as well, popularity wise, as the movies about high school or college, or some man and his friends. Thus, making movies a bit more difficult. The documentaries deserve their place in the library, being a place in which knowledge is found, while the box office movies, that are also released in other accessible places, are questionable. The fact that there is such a variation between children's movies, movies aiming for the teenage audience, and movies aimed towards the adults, is what makes it difficult. Which is why the majority of movies, asides from documentaries, really only have a place in a movie renting store, such as @CAPS6 or even @CAPS7. This way, the movie renting store doesn't have to worry about the library hauling in more people than them, on account of the fact that when someone is a member of a library, then he can rent out as many books or movies for the fee associated with joining. Versus having to pay for each movie rental that he makes, each time he goes there.      In the end, everything has its place. Books sincerely belong in a library. Magazines which are to enrich a person's minde and documentaries aiming to educate both have a place in the library. For everything else? There's a place to access them, and it's a place more designed to handle the sort of traffic associated with renting a movie or obtaining a magazine"
1,"Should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment? Of course they should. Libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday. Certain rated material should be put in certain spots for certain people. The library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis. Libraries need to become a little more organized.     Libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday. People of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library. With that being said, children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material. Children of course can't read everything in the library. They have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection. So if the library is more censored and strict about the material children can't get their hands on the material that they shouldn't be seeing at that time in their lives. You would want your seven year old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material, right.      Libraries should put the material that for adults eyes only in one completely different section of the library than what they would want the children that come to the library to see. With doing that it decreases the chances of the children getting a hold of material that they should see. Also, some books that the library think that some children should be able to see just might be offinsive to another set of people and wouldn't want their children to see. So books @MONTH1 show racism, or maybe another kind of discrimination and it @MONTH1 not be the goal of the book to make that suggestion but it still is in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some childrens minds.      The libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment. Libraries have become where children are just checking out books by themselves and to me thats a problem. I think that children need a parents concent to check out a book from a library but do the libraries care, no. Library @MONTH1 check their inventory and notice a book @MONTH1 be missing but guess what, by that time its already to late. Children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out. When children find a piece of material in a library and they know they aren't suppose to have it and they know they cant get out of the library with it they might decide to just take the book. The sercurity wont think twice to check the child and what is the result the childs mind is corrupted. Guess what you can blame it on the though the library. Isen't that something the child got the material from your friendly neighborhood library.     Oranization is the key. Libraries need to orginize their material better, plane and simple. It's really not that hard. They need to review the content that thier putting on the shelves in their establishment. I feel that the people at the library are lazy personally. If they just gave a little more effort maybe the children wouldn't get their hand on material that they have no buisness getting a hold of. Just pay attention to whats going on in the library. Their are books everywhere, right. Their are children, correct. The children @MONTH1 be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident. Though it was an accident it still happened and it can be prevented and it should be prevented for the sake of the children. All we need is a little more organization.     As you can see from the following libraries just don't about our children as much as we do. It's okay that everyone is welcome in the library no questions asked but, they people need to stay in the designated place in the library. Children shouldn't be allowed in the adult section for saftey. Also a book from the adult side shouldn't be in the childrens section because anything can happen and corruption will rise. We need stricter libraries. Better sercurity to what they children are looking at and where the material is. Also the library really needs to look at the material and decide if it is appropriate for all the readers that @MONTH1 look at the material. Organization is the key to all our worries, if we use a bit more effort this won't be a problem anymore."
1,"As the society continues to grow and controversial subjects become more accepted, children in this generation and future generations are more exposed to the flaws in society. How is this you @MONTH1 ask? Well, subjects such as drugs, sex, and alcohol can be seen everywhere from magazines, television commercials, and even books. Children are growing up faster and learning about subjects that they shouldn't even be thinking about until they are much older. However, as society becomes more comfortable with risque commercials and magazines advertising sex the more it will continue to go on and it @MONTH1 even get worse. As each generation continues to grow the faster they continue to grow up. Even though this is inevitable, kids shouldn't be growing up even quicker as they are exposed to adult subjects through books and magazines. Many kids visit the library and they @MONTH1 have access to these adult themed books. This shouldn't be allowed nor accepted. In conclusion, the books and magazines deemed not appropriate should be put in a restricted section where they will not be allowed to check out these items without parental consent.     As a young adult, I've been exposed to many adult subjects through @CAPS1, magazines, and even books. I remember as a child walking through my small town library and seeing risque models on the front's of magazines and I remember picking up books with suggestive pictures. Although these didn't affect the way I grew up and my way of thinking, it @MONTH1 affect another child differently. I was lucky enough to have parents who educated me on such adult subjects but what about other kids who don't have that. Once, when in my town library, I picked up a magazine and was curious as to why there was a half-naked women on the front. Looking through it, I read words that I had never heard before. The next day at school, I asked a fellow classmate what these unknown words were (which of course were not school appropriate) and was overheard by my teacher. I was sent to the principals office all because the library let people of all ages have access to these clearly not age appropriate books and magazines. Through that experience, it solidifies why there should be seperate sections of books that are not allowed to be accessed by children of a certain age.      I've grown up with several close friends with younger siblings and it baffles how much they know at such young age about sex, drugs, and alcohol. As a fifth grader I never dreamed of knowing what they knew. However, it all goes back to the fact that kids are simply more exposed to adult subjects as the society grows. These books and magazines shouldn't be placed in a library where kids have access. The library is supposed to be considered an educational place but what exactly do you want kids to be educated on. The more I'm around younger children, the more I see how society has affected them. Children are constantly exposed to adult subjects being glorified through books and magazines. When talking to young kids, they talk about sex, drugs, and alcohol as if they are no big deal. They've seen it almost everyday and have almost become comfortable with it. Do we honestly want our kids being exposed at a library that has always been thought of as educational?      As I've gotten older, I've paid more attention to the news and newspapers. It's sad opening up a newspaper and reading about bullying or underage drinking or even teen pregnancy. However, after sitting and thinking about it, @CAPS1 shows and magazines have glorified such things and have almost made it the cool thing to do. Research and statistics show the affects of children being more exposed by the signifigant amount of more kids getting violent, pregnant or even arrested. So I must ask. Why are we allowing such exposure to go on? Kids are going to be exposed no matter what but is it really necessary at a public library? If we could make a little bit of a difference in a child's life, then it would be worth the change of the way the library is ran. Let's improve our community and try to at least help keep kids out of trouble.     In conclusion, through my own experiences, observations, and reading I have solidified my argument that children should not have access to books and magazines with adult subjects in public libraries. When children have become young adults then yes, they @MONTH1 make their own decisions on what they should or shouldn't read but should we really be exposing children? I think not. Through sensoring books and magazines that children @MONTH1 check out, it will in a small way, help improve our already damaged society"
1,"There have been a lot of issues involving the censorship in libraries.  Some parents find materials to be inappropriate for their child and wish to have them taken out.  My views on cenosorship in libraries is that it is ok to have the books, music, movies, or magazines with possibly inappropriate information in it.  The parents of the child can prevent their child from viewing or listening to them if they don't think it's appropriate.  Something parents might find things inappropriate in their context, such as inappropriate language, sex, drug use, or fighting.  Some children might not understand what some of those things are because they never learned correctly by their parents so it is a way to learn new things.  Yes, some of the things might be bad, but most of the other information can be helpful.     I don't think that they should remove books, music, movies, or magazines that contain inappropriate information because the parents are ultimatly incharge of their child and what they read or view.  If a parent isn't comfortable with letting their child read or hear something that might be inappropriate then they shouldn't allow them to view it.  Some parents might think that the same material is inappropriate, it all depends on the parent's views.  If a parent has no problem with their child viewing some of the things in the libraries then it shouldn't be taken out and the child should get the chance to view it.  Books and movies are about the way life is, so when a child reads a book or watches a movie they will be getting some life experiances and it will help them.     There can be some inappropriate parts in movies, books, music, and magazines, but if the child doesn't do anything about it then it shouldn't be too much of a problem.  If a child read a book about fighting or saw a movie about fighting and then went out and got in a fight that would be a problem, but that doesn't mean that that book or movie shouldn't be allowed to be read by other children.  People take information differently, some take it literally and have to try it out while some are fine and move on after they finish the book or movie.  In a book or in movies people usually have sex when they love each other, so it would teach the child to only do that when they are sure.  Some kids might be so interested in it they might try it as soon as they can, but the majority won't.       Books, movies, music, and magazines can be very informational.  They can teach you how to build things or how to make a good breakfast, but in some parent's eyes they can also teach their children that doing drugs and other illegal things are ok and acceptable.  If a child reads a book about someone who does drugs, do you think they'll look up to the person after they see the affects it has on that person?  Of course not, in the media and at school they might learn it's cool to do drugs because everyone else does it, but in a book they can see what actually happens.  If the parents never got around to teaching the kid right and wrong it might be a substitute for them because it will persuade them not to do drugs, or have sex until their married.  If a child watches a movie or reads a book that is about fighting they might become violent and use that to hurt other people, but they could also use it for self-defense if they need to.  If a child is getting bullied and it becomes physical they would need a way to defend themself, but if they watched a lot of fighting movies or read a lot of fighting books they would know what to do.     I can understand why some parents might think some materials are inappropriate for their children.  Their children are their babies and they don't want to open them up to a world of bad things so they want to protect them.  If the child doesn't learn at an early age what some of those things are they could have problems later on in life, their parents need to let them learn things on their own.  Some materials can be a little inapropriate for younger children, but some kids hear worse things at school than they read about in a book or hear in a song.  Some kids need to learn what some of the things are and if you take the resources out of the libraries they'll learn from unreliable sources.  It is alright to have inappropriate things in the library, they shouldn't be censored because of a couple of people's views."
1,"With all media there are choices to be made. Any time you flip on your television or go to the movie store, you have to decide what you want to watch. When you turn on your radio or look through cds you have to decide what you want to listen to. These are basic decisions that most people face multiply times a day. You alone get the chance to pick what you want or need to be watching or listening to. You get the freedom to pick what you desire and going to the library shouldn't be any different.      The library is a place for all races, ages, genders, cultures and religions. The public uses this place as a source of knowledge. The books, magazines, and movies here can help people in multiply ways from their jobs to school, and even to find out what could be making them sick. These sources of media help people get certain things accomplished and better their knowledge on whichever topic they are researching. The library should not cenor certain pieces of media because some people @MONTH1 find them offensive. This isn't fair to those who need these sources for work, school, or for their own pure enjoyment. The fact that someone might be going there to get informatio, on a subject that someone else @MONTH1 find offensive, and then search and search to find that the information on the subject has been put away is a total dissapointment and waste of time. They should be able to depend on the library to have articles, book, magazines, and documentaries on whatever topic they @MONTH1 be researching. Saying that our country is free and that we have a freedom of speech would not be supported by the fact that certain materials are put away just because someone @MONTH1 take offense to it.     Children's minds are getting polluted daily. Whether your child is hanging out with their friends or walking to school they will alwys find out things they shouldn't know for years, and have worries that only adults should have. There is no way to prevent a child from the world. They live in it so they are in fact going to have to deal with what's inside of it and learn from it. If it's the children that people are worried about seeing offensive materials, then there are many ways to make sure that doesn't happen. Parents who are concerned that their son or daughter @MONTH1 come across something in the library that is too violent, sexual, or mature for them, have many possible alternatives. They could always stay with their child so they know that what they see is what they're child will also see. Also, in most libraries there is a childrens' section. Knowing that those are only books for kids you could put them in that area. If worse comes to worse and the parents don't want to take the risk at all of their son or daughter running into something to mature for them, then they could always go to the library for them. No matter where a child goes there will always be a risk of them comming across something they shouldn't, and if you're optimistic about the situation then them learning something ahead of time @MONTH1 turn out to be a good thing.     Libraries are for the public and therefore should be able to talk about public things. For example, I am completley and totally against abortion. I think that it is against nature and for me, it's against my religion. Having said this, I would not be offended what so ever to find books or even magazines discussing abortion is a positive manner. I think it is everyones' choice to decide what they want, and they should be able to read about people that agree with them.     The world will be more pulluted with offensive subjects and topics every day. I think that the least we can do is have a place to go where we can learn about them freely. Libraries should not be censored because we as @CAPS1 should be free to learn and read about what interests us without feeling ashamed because what we want to check out is in the restricted section. That could just be completely embarrassing. Censoring one public place would just make people realize that we have bad events going on in our world and we obviously can't face them if we ask the librarians to move certain things to the back room. Everyone should have the oppurtunity to reseach, and holding us back from learning would be against our contitution. Removing items from the shelves wouldn't be removing them from the world so we might as well deal with what's going on and be able to freely learn about it!"
1,"To @CAPS1 it @DATE2 concern,     @CAPS2 in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis. Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities. @PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' @CAPS3 is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should should have some censorship, but up to a specific point.     We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another. If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not. The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else; she could say she wanted @CAPS3 book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone?     Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual. I have dealt with situations like @CAPS3 before; everyone has. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash. Eveyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left. The library shelves would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point.     Taking into account everyone's diversification in @CAPS3 world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there.     When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals. @CAPS2 is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everday with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them. @CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. Afterall, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty.     Thank you."
1,"In today's modern world, censorship sparks controversy from many library patrons and citizens. Many individuals have different viewpoints about this controversial topic, and often these values contradict the beliefs of their peers. Censorship refers to the elimination of materials deemed offensive and harmful to prelude any disruptive activity that can harm the world. In this particular situtation, I believe that certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be censored, although many individuals @MONTH1 interpret as offensive.      An example of censorship in today's society is @CAPS1 filters and its effect on the library and its surrounding environment. Many people feel that @CAPS1 filters serve a vital function in order to censor material on the @CAPS1 that can be harmful and disruptive to people of all ages. Libraries are places patrons go to learn to information, and gather knowledge to help them with their everyday lives. Libraries today provide a wide array of novels to protect the human rights. Another example of censorship is shown in @PERSON2's @CAPS4 @NUM1 novel. As I interpreted from the novel, the topic of censorship appealed to the individuals of that time and age, and they strongly believed that books should be censored because they serve no apparent function in society. Many felt that books are useless, tedious, and prevent them from enjoying other activities they adore. A scene from the book is when a elderly lady stood up for her beliefs and values, and died just to keep the fireman from burning her books and her house. However, reading books and understanding its context is not only beneficial to the well-being and character of individuals, but it also teaches life lessons that will aid them in the future.     I strongly believe that censorship in libraries is not only unjust, but it keeps people from understanding the complexity of information found in novels and its strong impact it can have on those who read them. Each book in a library is unique in its own way. They contain content that @MONTH1 be humorous, mysterious, interesting, or even suspenseful. That's what makes books the way they are. Although some books @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, they shouldnt be removed from shelves because another person might enjoy the same exact book. I do believe that certain books should be edited or censored so that it wont have a harmful influence on children and young adults, however I feel that if someone has a certain issue with a book on the shelf, they can leave the library and go somwhere else. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, each citizen in @LOCATION1 is entitled to freedom of speech, and human rights. There are a diverse number of people in today's society, and that is what makes our world interesting and creative. Each individual is personally responsible for the actions that they perform.      In other words, if a certain material in a library is deemed as offensive to people, they have a right to complain but they dont have the right to eradicate it from shelves. I do believe that some material found in novels are astonishing and makes me uncomfortable. But if one person feels that a book is offensive, their are many other individuals who believe that the book is interesting and pleasant. Would it be fair to eliminate a book just because a person doesnt like it? The answer is simple. No. For example, when I went to the library a couple days ago, I picked up a book and right then I loved it. When I went to check it out, I saw another girl pick up the same book, read a portion of it, and set it back down. She seemed to dislike it. Just because the girl doesnt like it, doesnt mean that the book should be removed. Like I said before, libraries are places people go to interact with their peers, and learn new life lessons. If certain material was censored, no one would enter libraries because all the material has been diminished and removed.      Each individual has a fundamental mind of their own which sets them apart from those around them. They each enjoy different books, and they each learn new ideas. Censoring books that @MONTH1 be offensive should not be permitted. Not only does this hurt the library and its state of mind, but it keeps people from reading what they like. As Katherine Paterson stated in her quote, certain books should be censored that @MONTH1 be deemed harmful for children. However, then we wont have any books that people will read, and less people will visit libraries. Libraries should contain a variety of books and magazines, in order to attract more patrons and keep them open to new information"
1,"Censorship is not only a problem that newspapers are facing and is becoming more prevalent in libraries and book stores. All across the country, book/music/movie carriers are taking certain books and other materials off the shelves that they deem inappropriate for their clients. The problem is, even if that book is taken out of a store, that doesn't mean is in accessable. Also,  shouldn't the library or media store simply move the books and materials so children @MONTH1 not get ahold of them. Whereas adults who @MONTH1 enjoy whatever that piece of entertainment @MONTH1 be, will be able to check it out or buy it, thus the stores or library don't lose any customers either.      Libraries are generally in charge of buying or ordering the books or other materials they want or chose to hold in their facility. Because they are giving this freedom, the administrators would already have an idea of what they would or wouldn't want to buy, depending on what they believe would be appropriate for anyone using the library. Therefore, the library shouldn't even have any material to be thought of as 'offensive' in their system. If something isn't generally accepted as offensive, the library would most likely carry it, and it would be up to the parents' discrestion to determine what their children are reading, not a library.       As for various stores selling books, or music, or movies, they should simply move the materials to an adult only section in the store, and/or make the customer produce an @CAPS1 in order to purchase that item. Though this @MONTH1 be a hassle, it prevent unnecessary censorship and infringement on our rights guaranteed by the @ORGANIZATION1. If this causes the sale of that item to go down, then many stores @MONTH1 not carry it, or the company would get the hint that their song, book, movie, magazine, etc. was too sketchy for the public, and possibly @MONTH1 prevent its likeness from reoccuring. The problem then just solves itself, and censorship doesn't have to come into play.     Another point, said in the quote from Katherine Paterson, states that even though you @MONTH1 want a book removed, if everyone removed a book they deemed inappropriate, then there would be no books left to buy or read. The same thought can be applied to the new music we listen to, where if we all were able to prevent a song from being recorded based on whether or not we find it offensive, we'd have not music, and such follows with movies and magazines. The problem with censorship is that there is no clear cut line on where to stop, meaning if one thing gets censored, it could end up being completely changed or completely removed. This could also lead to censorship bleeding over into that genre of book or music or movie, and that whole genre would end up censored or cut. There is just no clear cut end.     As a person who has been or is a teenager, one would no that with today's access to the @CAPS2, censorship inadequate. Even if a child is prevented from reading or listening to something, now days they can just look it up online. The stores and libraries @MONTH1 try to rid of offensive material, but in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, once it's out there, it's out there. Kids will find ways to access something even if they can't legally buy it or aren't given permission to read it. Therefore, it becomes the parents' responsibility to monitor what their kids read and listent to, and to install their own limits on the @CAPS2 they receive, and not the store or library who merely carry what will either make money or attract customers.     There is only so much that can be done to shelter people from offensive material. The fact is, offensive material exists, has existed and will probably always exist. Everyone has a right to publish or read what they will, and the opposite (not publish or read what they will) is true. The cold truth is, parents now will have to step up their ideals for what their child is exposed to, rather than rely on society to do it for them. We are all given the right to read, say, and publish what we want, and even if we don't agree with the material someone else has produced, we don't have a right to completely censor it. The best we can do and hope for is sheltering our children from offensive material, which is really no responsibility of a store and little responsibility of a library. As a newspaper, the views on censorship are very harsh, and should be in any case of censorship in any other print or media setting."
1,"Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place."
1,"As a human being, I have the right to take in knowledge that I can apply later in my life, as does any other living person. A person should not be able to take the oppertunity to experince a graphic situation in a safe enviroment away from another. A library is a place that contains a large mass of stories whether they are fiction or non, and within the many stories some material @MONTH1 be thought too graphic for a young child, even young adults. This graphic material is neccesary for ones developement. If a child were to live a life censored from the harsh enviorment of the @CAPS2 as it truly is, then the child, after coming of age, would eventually enter the @CAPS2 with no preparation for the harsh enviorment it it will be placed in. A few examples, as I will explain further, are: books of @CAPS2 history, fictional books of a person's real life situation, and books thatwould create new ideas in one's growing mind.    The past cannot be completely told without dwelling into the dark half of it. If one were raised in veiwing our @CAPS2's history as simple conquests of country and man, then they would be blind to the desperation some men can reach. An example; @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the @CAPS5 @PERSON1, along with the @CAPS6 power, began a campaign to take over most of @LOCATION1. That is the lighter side of the @CAPS3 with @LOCATION3. If a child were only presented with this information, censored of the horrible things that had taken place, then the child will not know of the genocide of the @CAPS7 population, or of the massive nuclear bombing of @CAPS8, or even of the bombing of @LOCATION2 that had brought @LOCATION4 into the @CAPS3. Sure, a child @MONTH1 have a small metion of it as they learn history, but what if said child were to want to know more? If the library were to have censored their collection, then the child would would only get the information he had already been presented with. One @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS9 does it matter if a child would recieve the full explaination of what had truly happened on those events?' The answer is simple; the past can be repeated if we do not learn from our mistakes.   A library @MONTH1 not see the need for books that contain graphic situations such as one that @MONTH1 contain drugs, sex, violence, or mental illnesses, but in my opinion, these books are neccesary to let a young adult develope a sense for dealing with these situations. We, as humans, cannot deny that the @CAPS2 is filled with these things. It would be wise to allow our children to dwell into the books that will let them experience the situations in a safe enviroment, without them actually going into the @CAPS2 and experiencing it first hand. A person endangers a child when they raise them without letting them experience these things in a safe enviroment, for the real @CAPS2 is harsh. Therefore, it is neccesary for the library to stock books needed to teach the growing community.    It is neccesary for a young adult to create their own opinions on graphic subjects. If a person were to grow up without seeing the both the darker and a lighter side of life then they @MONTH1 not have the ability to form their own moral values. One who does not recognize wrong doings as something that is bad is liable to fall under the corruption evil thoughts @MONTH1 bring. When raising ones child, a person should present the dark side of life to them and teach them the morals of life. Explain to the young that what evil that has happened in the past should not be done again. A library would be a valueble recource in the teaching of these moral values in the education of child, but if a library were censored, the child would not have past experiences to learn from.     Many of my arguements presented are from things that have been said once before, such as; learning from our mistakes in the past so they @MONTH1 not happen in the future, taking the lesser of two evils or even staying on the safer side when teaching a young one the evils of life, and teaching right from wrong to a child before they can incidently develope a corrupt opinion for themselves. In conclusion, I state that a library without censorship is neccesary for the teachings of children. Everyone has the right to see the @CAPS2 as it truly is, uncensored and corrupt. My only wish is for them to learn of the @CAPS2 in a safe enviroment such as a library."
1,"Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.     So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay"
1,"In this persuation essay it will talk about the content of should we or shouldn't we remove all offensive books, music, movies, magazines of the shelf. In this essay everyone will agree with the content or be in the opposing side of the aurgument. In this essay it isn't the exception that this essay will disagree with some of the viewing audience; however, there are situations in which the audience can go with both sides.      To begin with, in the matter of the case should we or should we not remove offensive books,music, magazines, or movies from the library. I don't believe that all content should be remove for all to see. In some cases there are the exception, but in banding all material doesn't seem logic. In my point of view the removal of materials seems a little extreme; however putting the content in a higher shelf seems more pratical instead of removal all for good. Yes, it might be offensive but in this time period offensive movies, books, magazines, books, and so on are look as more comedial and not taken serious. For example, a really offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a really offensive and people just see it as entertaining. This show can be offensive to everyone, but yet we still see it. In this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children @NUM1 and older. Parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing. It's not the creator of the content to be banned, yet it is the job as a parent to be mindful in what their kids are reading, watching, looking, or listening not them. In which case there there isn't away to be right in this subject. However the creators of the conent see it as a way to vent over their lifes, experiences, and what opticals they had to faceor just to make people laugh. They see it as a safe way to espress themselves. It might be offensive to you, but for some people that's there life. You might not like it or it @MONTH1 seem harsh for you, but that's real life.      Secondly there are always something that @MONTH1 offend you, but it doesn't seem logical to banned it. An example might be religion. A religion a person might be it might offend you. It doesn't mean if the religion offensive that it will get banned or be remove for everyone. Your religion @MONTH1 offend someone, but they deal with it and embrace the differnces. If your friends has a different religion it doesn't mean you will never talk to them ever again.      Thirdly, you might express yourself and there are going to be people out there that won't agree with you. You might create a book, a song, or a movie that will offend someone in a way. For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some guys and girls. A disagrrement between two girls fighting over which charater is better for @CAPS4. There are always an opposing side. A @CAPS2 might be tried of hearing about @CAPS5 all of time and might find offensive when a girl @MONTH1 compare him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1. Saying why can't boys be like them, but even then they don't remove @CAPS3 all together. For you it might seem the greatest movie ever, or the most terrible movie in the universe.      Fourthly, another example is a @CAPS8 show called, '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (queen of the south) where a women that had nothing to begin with, yet ended up being the most wanted in some countries. Some people @MONTH1 seem that it might be cool to be just like her. It doesn't seem that people will go uot there and do what she does cause in the television show shows all of the consequences there are if you do what she did. This show is an example of what could happen if you become exactly like her. Some offensive material @MONTH1 teach a lesson and can pervent a person to do something that they @MONTH1 later regreat.     In conclusion, everything in our life offends us in some way. It doesn't matter what it is we deal with it and our life goes on. There is no way to see this, but one thing you enjoy maybe be offensive to others. It wouldn't seem fair to take something you enjoy just because it offended one person. So I belive that the libaries censorship isn't at risk. In my opinion everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or even listen to. And also have the choice to stop reading it, watching it, or listening to it"
1,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern;      As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that @MONTH1 be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves.      As @CAPS1 citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities.This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that @MONTH1 be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as @CAPS2, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want.      Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they @MONTH1 only see @CAPS3 rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it!     Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in @LOCATION1 alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way.     Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions."
1,"Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf. If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left!      If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it. Other people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic, or like that kind of music. I understand that some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or @MONTH1 even need that information for a research project. There are also many books on the @CAPS1, some people @MONTH1 find that offensive, or @MONTH1 not want their kids reading about that, but that is history. It's a time period in the past and it @MONTH1 be something a high school student is doing a research paper over. I have done a research paper over the @CAPS1 and I have read some very mature material that younger kids @MONTH1 not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the @CAPS1 off of the shelves at our local library.     There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic.      If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about.      Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact."
1,"Some people believe that censorship in works of art such as literature, music, artwork, and movies is necessary. Many disagree on what is appropriate to be shown and heard and seen, and what is not. Honestly, it depends on the age group. Younger children have more impressionable minds and are definately in need of censorship. However, older audiences should know right from wrong and should be able to watch or see or read whatever they want. In libraries censorship is not needed at all. The simplest thing one can do is split the materials up into groups, like chilren, young adults, and adults. Then there is no hassle about what someone's child @MONTH1 have picked up and took home from the library. There is a section devoted to the materials viewed as appropriate for children.     Of course, as children, the content of books and movies and music from the library should be censored as the parents see fit. If it's just a chapter book with no pictures, a young child will not really understand what is going on, because there are no pictures. However, it's still pretty vital to watch what a child @MONTH1 be reading, because the book @MONTH1 contain inappropriate words that one would normally punish the child for saying. Graphic picture books, on the other hand, @MONTH1 prove to cause more damage to a child's mind. Pictures and sight are how children learn, and if it's all blood and violence, the child @MONTH1 be emotionally scarred or changed in some way. Then again, the child @MONTH1 still not be able to understand what is going on in the picture. And if those bad words or graphic pictures are kept from the child until they are mature enought to look at them, then they'll be fine.     Young adults and adults can handle more graphic stuff that children. No censorship is needed, unless the parent of the young adult wishes the child to be a fourty-year-old virgin. Cases of this do happen, but the teen will just find a way to the content anyways, especially if it is forbidden. Most teens and young adults and adults know enough to understand appropriate actions from inappropriate actions. So if something violent happens in a book or there's grapic pictures, it's acceptable for them to read or see. They'll know that they're not allowed to go be a serial killer, or rape somebody or something. However, how one reacts to books read from a library all stems back to how they were taught as children, and how they matured. In most cases, censorship is downright ridiculous and unnecessary.     Now, a way to make everybody happy on both sides of this argument. It's simple, because all the library has to do is organize its content into age-group-friendly sections. Sectors of child-friendly texts, with their happy colorful picture books like anything by @PERSON1, and funny book series, like '@PERSON2 the @CAPS1', and '@CAPS2'. Also a section for young adults/ teens, because even though teens like to think that they can be up for anything, and are allowed to read anything, most parents don't want their teen reading a romance novel with a multitude of raunchy sex chapters. So innapropriate romance novels, gone. The average teen likes to read book that they can relate to, so books based on a teenager's life and what happens to them @MONTH1 go there also. Next comes the adult section. Absolutely anything can go here, because adults are viewed as mature as one is able to get and can handle anything they read. The romances fit in quite well here.     Censorship in libraries is an idea that would leave a library bookless, and that defeats the whole point of a library. Parents would come raging through and take out all the books that they don't like or don't see fit for their children, and other people would take out anything that they didn't like too. A library is supposed to be a place where you can find some sort of information on anything, and a book in every genre by almost every author. Chilren obviously need to be limited on what they @MONTH1 read, but teens and adults  have more freedom. The most reasonable solution to make both sides happy is to break the book up into sections, where each age group can be happy with what they get, and the parents can be happy as well. No material should be removed or banned from a library because of content. There should always be a place for any book in a library, because a library is where books of all kinds belong."
1,"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever"
1,"I know that some people find some books offensive mean cruel or racist but most of the time people write @CAPS4 beacuase its what they feel or what people want to read. Books are a privlige and we should be able to use that privledge. People need to learn that its ok that books are sometimes are a little harsh. The @CAPS1 is not the most friendly place ever and books can help convay that with less hurt then  experencing @CAPS4 first hand.   I know that all books should be left on the shelfs becuase just because its offensive to someone doesnt mean that you should take @CAPS4 off. For every book someone will find @CAPS4 offensive because of somthing. If the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone. If someone took the time to go out and write and book and make sure that everything about @CAPS4 is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read @CAPS4. They have a right to write @CAPS4 and we have a right to read @CAPS4 and no one should take that right away. If someone wrote a book on the hollocost people are very offended by that but they dont try to get ride of @CAPS4. so why should any book be different because its not a big event like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Its just seem so upserd that people who go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by @CAPS4. I think they just need to suck @CAPS4 up and move on. if they dont like @CAPS4 then dont read @CAPS4. Someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read @CAPS4.      I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in are library and they said,'oh you cant read that because @CAPS4 was found to offencive.' @CAPS4 made me uphald that they would deciede how someone els feels about a book. @CAPS4 makes me so angry that they get to dicied how someone els feels about a book. they must be magic becuase I did not know that they know how someone els feels about a book or anything for that matter. we do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk. and im ok with that beacuse at least they have @CAPS4 for people to read if they really wanted to. This is what i think should happen if they have books that they think is too offensive to people. At least try to give an effert to perserve are right as citizens of the @ORGANIZATION1.     Lets throw an other aspect here about money. the book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely payed by you, the tax payer. So you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money. That is just insane that you would want to wast that money after @CAPS4 being payed for. This just make me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book. Does @CAPS4 make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone. Well good for you mission accomplished. All you did was get worked up and you wasted money. People just need to relize the bigger picture not just themselfs but others. In them taking down a book because you were offended, offends me. This offends me a large amount because now you ruined somthing that was not nessisary to be taken down.     This is how I feel about this subject. I am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library. If you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel. I know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work. People need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter. Stand back and think for a second and say,'will this really effect me if i get this book taken off the shelf.' @CAPS4 also make me mad that the libary bought the book and now its gone so did the money just go to waist becuase the book is just gone. This is how I feel on the matter of getting ride of books."
1,"Cooling the @CAPS1: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 From Book @PERSON1 _________     Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.     To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship.     If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.     From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of @CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.     Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.     If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.     In the past few years, with the effects of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, @LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @CAPS8 and of the @CAPS9. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what @MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?     This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it @MONTH1 have a power that is unrealized. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom."
1,"I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. First, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be sensored or not. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable.      Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. Some people @MONTH1 not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong.      It is either your own responsiblity or a parents responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. So most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life. It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age.      The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastarous. The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove.I once read To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools, and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devestating.      You should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive. Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own resposiblity to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music and magazines. It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture"
1,"I believe that libraries should offer a variey of different material. Nothing should have to be removed from the shelves. How are people suppose to learn about the worlds history, or major events that have taken place if we do not have the resources to learn from? This world is no where near perfect and as a society we should all know that. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, and we all have the right to say what we think is best. There are times that we have to put our pride aside, and do what we know is the right thing to do. It wouldn't be right to sensor important information from adolesents and children. They have the right to know and learn the truth.      I believe every book has a special purpose and meaning. They are each written for a certain reason. We live in a free nation, which means nobody is forced to have to read something they don't want to read. Books have been around for thousands of years and are the major tools we use to learn from. They brought many of us joy as a child to be able to listen and explore the adventures that every story tells. Books are like humans because no two humans are the same, just as no two books are exactly the same, as well.      Music has been around since the beginning of time. It's a way to express yourself and learn to listen to things in different ways. There are so many types of different kinds of music. Every person has different tastes in music, so a library should not exclude any certain kind. People use music for many different reasons. Peope use music to relax, teach, inform, express, as a hobby, etc. Every part of the world uses music, some countrys use it in ceremonies, religion, to pay respect, and to worship. A world without music is unimaginable! No library should ever have to remove a kind of music, just to create censorshop. Music can bring the world closer together in unity.      Movies are a great sorce of entertainment. Movies help us learn a topic visually, which gives us a better explanation of topics and certain circumstances. Movies are used to teach, inform, educate, and bring us happiness. Movies have different kinds of rating that inform us on what age group the movie is appropriate for. A library shouldn't have to remove some movies just because of a certain topic or rating. The rating gives a clear explanation as to why the movie is rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, or @CAPS3. Parents and teachers are educated enough to be able to make the choice of rather they believe the movie is alright for that group of people or person to watch. A library shouldn't be forced to have to make that choice for them.     Just like books, music, and movies; magazines are used for the purpose of entertainment, to inform, and to teach. There are a broad range of different types of magazines, as well. I believe libraries should offer every kind of magazine. Obvisoully not the kind that are created for adult eyes only; which are not appropriate for a public community library, at all! But as far as different styles of magazines that are made to be read for diffent genders or educate us on certian things, libraries should offer them.      Based on my own experiances, if I'm needing to find certain information on a topic and a library doesn't carry any information about it, it drives me crazy! libraries are used by people as a convienance for them. No one wants to have to go through a lot of trouble to find what they're looking for.      My observations while in a library is very broad. There are manys different types of ages, both male and females, families, friend, employees, teachers, etc. We all use the library for the same reason though. We all go there to find information on topics. And to find books, movies and music that we want for entertainment.     Overall books, music, movies and magazines are all important to a community. Without them life wouldn't be the same. We need to offer every type of them, so no person is left out. They offer us so much knowledge on each generation of the world and the different types of cultures in it. We live in a free country and as a free county we should all have the right to be able to pick from the types of things we want"
1,"Content featured in a library should not be taken lightly because of the words or the message that it presents.  Everything from Books, music, movies, magazines, videogames, art, and others can convey a message when the viewer sees it, wether it be positive or negative.  The creature of said content has that right to make it, and no one should strip him of that right.  however, it seems that libraries across the world are banning that content because they personally find it offensive.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc should not be removed because it goes against the first amendment, it is an insult to the man/woman who created the content, and the fact that the banning or censoring itself is judged on one's opinion with the library itself than rather the general public's opinion.     The first amendment was created as a way to ensure that everyone has that right to have a voice.  Wether it be speech, religion, press, or actions of an individual; no one has the obligation to go against it.  The fact that the libraries can ban or censor the content in their facilities is against the first amendment because they are implying that you have no rights when your content is being viewed in the general public.  This action to neglect the first amendment can lead to other acts such as: protest, book burning, anarchy, etc. is not only an overall visual on how blinded people can be when a topic they do not agree with can affect them, but how they can easily neglect the hard work and thoughts our forefathers put in to make the @CAPS1.  Censorship of lyrics, movies, and magazines are another act against the @CAPS1.  One of the reasons why ratings systems are on these items is to warn the reader, but to also protect the creator's first amendment rights.  The first amendment gives authors and creators more freedom to write their stories uninterrupted with safeguards, and to lock their chances of having their voices heard is, well...an insult.     Take for instance, @CAPS2 @NUM1.  The book's author (who for the sake of this essay shall not be named.) had his material stripped from library shelves and burned to the ground.  He expressed how insulted he was, how badly misinterpereted the book was, and was overalled appaled by their ignorance.  This begins a new reason why books should not be banned or censored from libraries: insulting the author.  Multiple books such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 code, even religious texts such as the bible and the korran are banned from libraries because of their accused 'offensive' nature the books poseess.  The authors are insulted and hurt that they put a lot of effort into creating an engrossing and open minded world for the reader, only to be shot down by the libraries dictatory ruling on their content.  It can also lead to the libraries sense of poor morals being contradictory to the content they have not decided to ban.  Which leads to this: why is the libraries' opinion more powerful?     Now before the next reason is discussed, it is acknwoledged that the Libraries have that right to ban materials because it is their facility that they pay for; but the process that they undergo to confirm a banned book is rather opinionated within the library itself. Libraries should not ban or censor materials based on their own opinion because it resonates a biased tone that the libraries poesses.  The judgement on a book is settled between that said library and multiple libraries across the district.  Granted, some libraries will agree that it should not be banned or censored, but it will all lead to majority vote.  Instead, that decision should be discussed between schools, communites, councils, etc. so that way a more outspoken voice can support or deny the material.  It doesnt ensure that the book will not be banned, but at least a general voice will be more sufficent than a concealed voice.     Libraries should not have the right to ban or censor materials contained in the libraries because it goes against the first amendment, it is an insult to the author or creator of the material, and the banning or censoring is judged with the libraries opinion than rather the general public's opinion.  This is an ongoing topic that is still being discussed today, and will most likely be ongoing in the future.  This has been written to inform and, hopefully, persuade you that this is a serious matter that should not be taken lightly."
1,"Be a parent or responsible child  if you are against censorship. Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue. If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it. Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies. It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly.      One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best.     Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from.     The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'. With that being said dont avoid the inevitable."
1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,     I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine.      The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product.     Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did @CAPS7. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.        @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien.     Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.      Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.      I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.      As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7. Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7. That would be on the parents plate to deal with.      Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain. Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty.      I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up.                                   Thank You,                                   @PERSON2"
1,"Is @CAPS1 @CAPS2?      People all over the world are sensitive when it comes to certain things. Some are more sensitive than others and @CAPS1 can cause problems. That is when censorship is questioned, are there right amounts of censorship in public? When a person goes to the library there is one thing that everyone is there for, research of some sort. Whether it be for school, work, or pure interest, it does not matter. Books, magazines, movies and even @CAPS3 are there for our benefit, yet there are some items that @MONTH1 be seen as horrid and completly out of line in the library. @CAPS1 brings the question: should these items be removed for their obscene facts? These items in fact should not be removed from shelves, for they are also there to teach.      The library can be a place for teens and adults to get work done, it also can be a place where a little child learns about books and finds themself in a new world. @CAPS1 is exactly why certain things are questioned for being on the shelves. There are certain topics in the world that are very senstive to other people whether it be because of race, sex, or religion, what the people must remember is that they have no complete control over what is discussed or brought up in public.      They can however turn away from it and pretend it never was. When they go to the library though, they feel as if they should have the right to take everything they think harmful to society off of the shelves and all out together. @CAPS1 is in fact not true, all they can do is tell their own children to turn away, but they can not get rid of it.      Stated earlier, there are many topics that are out there that some people find too harsh to bring into the public, but what they do not realize is the fact that we can learn from these things. Eventhough there are things out there parents @MONTH1 find wrong, we children and young adults @MONTH1 need those things to help us with problems or situations we are in. For example, with teen pregnancy going up more in these years than in the past, parents feel like they must keep their teens away from all exposure to sex. Doing @CAPS1 they ban television shows that @MONTH1 seem to 'glamorize' what it is like to be a teen mom. In fact @CAPS1 is completely false, a teen must get the real facts from where ever they can. Sometimes they @MONTH1 have to get it from people around them, from people they knowe. Since a library is a place of learning they would be able to research things there, but if there are parents who take censorship to a new level then there will be some problems.      If a parent were to go so far as to tell there teen to not learn about those things, then there is a greater chance of their teen being oblivious to what could happen. Doing @CAPS1 probably will get them into a situation they could have avoided. That is why there should be censorship but not take things too far and pull things off the shelf.     Another problem is that there are parents who are worried about the things that their teen or children run into at the library. They @MONTH1 be curious about certain things and look up books that @MONTH1 not be age appropriate. @CAPS1 is one situation where a parent will want to take things off of the shelves, that way there is no temptation, no worry that thier children will be at risk. @CAPS1 could be wrong because the parent would be taking away knowledge the teen @MONTH1 need for later use. They feel like they are making things better in their life, when they are actually taking important things away.       Censorship is a very serious topic that is always there. Some believe that things in the library are there for a reason, they are there for people to learn from, they are there to warn others about serious consequences. @CAPS1 is why people should not be so insensitive and try to take action about taking the books out of the public. People should instead imbrace the fact that there will be certain things they will not agree with, and not try to take them away. They should realize that though they @MONTH1 not be comfortable, there are others out there learning from @CAPS1"
1,"Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you."
1,"I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone"
1,"Many @CAPS1 believe that they should know what kind of material their children are reading, listening to, and watching. But how can this be accomplished for all people to choose what is available for them? That is where a quote by author Katherine Paterson comes into play, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhore-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.' @CAPS2 is saying, through this quote, that if one person had the right to remove something off of a shelf then everyone has that right. But if everyone has that right then very few to zero materials would be left. So @CAPS1 should have the final say in what is being displayed to their children becuase it is their children who are being influenced in this society.       There is a limit to what can be sensored from the children of this day. There is an abundance of material that is available at their fingertips, most of which is not appropriate for their age category. Once a child has viewed an inappropriate magazine cover, or heard an inappropriate song, etc., it @MONTH1 forever be engraved in their minds. Is that what we want our children to be thinking of? Personally I think that @CAPS1 should have the right to choose how to raise their children, and part of that is determined by what children are seeing on magazine covers in checkout isles in the store, the music that is played in public areas and movies that are showed to them at schools.      The real question is where do you create the boundry line? Who should be deciding what is appropriate for children to view? People have different beliefs in how to raise their children. Some children have practically no boundries and are free to do as they please. While on the other hand some children have an abundance of rules about what they can or cannot do, see or view. While there is an absurdity to somethings that are availlable, there is also a practicallity to letting children see what the world is like. But there is no easy way of making sure that your innocent @NUM1 year-old doesn't see that practically nude woman on a magazine cover as you check out. @CAPS1 should have the final authority of what their children view on a day to day basis. Part of a @CAPS1 job is to make sure their children aren't growing up to fast, and by being exposed to some of these things will absolutely have an influence on how fast they develop in terms of what they think about.       I believe that if a majority of people find a book, movie, magazine, music, or any type of media, etc., to be offensive we have the right as citizens to have them removed from our public areas. If any music or type of media is overwhelmingly filled with language that is hardly appropriate for adults, then it should definitelly be removed from any childs availability. The same would apply to any books or magazines, but also the use of nude pictures, or almost nude pictures is extremely unneccessary in any use. Any pornographic material should not be available to children, especially those who are very young. The content of the questionable items that are believed to be inappropriate should be reviewed and then taken out of the viewing area if a majority of people believe it to be inappropriate.      In conclusion I believe that @CAPS1 should have the final say in what is displayed for their children to see. As a @CAPS3 I believe that children should not be viewing some of the things that they are able to see at this point in their life. Some of the material displayed is not healthy for anyone to be seeing let alone children. When you enter a library you want to enter a place theat is a safe environment for your children, not a place that you have to be worried about what they @MONTH1 see or hear. So I believe that if a majority of people believe something to be offensive to them it should be heavily considered to be removed from the shelf or taken out of the viewing area"
1,"Imagine your favorite book, song, and movie. The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read a million times over. The ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much. Now imagine it gone from the libraries. What happened to it? You think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do?         When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selections of books and other materials to choose from. A library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in. This is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people. If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Libraries should accomodate as many people as they are able. Removing material from the shelves @MONTH1 make some people happy, but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable.     Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. Doing this could result in less material for people of all ages. If you find something to be offensive, all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out. In Katherine Paterson's words, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on teh shelf for any of us.' I believe that if items were to be removed from the shelves, there would be less for others to enjoy.      Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch. If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only disable you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material.      Many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive. While some @MONTH1 think that some books have subjects too racy for readers, others @MONTH1 not feel that this is not the case. Take a popular childrens book like @LOCATION1's @CAPS1. To some, this @MONTH1 be one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book. They would have never had the chance to make their own opinions.      I feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion. It is only natural to disagree with someone. You can always run into people that don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies. Eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people. If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only reach out to a certain audience. Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste.      To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people. If an item that someone was looking forward to checking out was no longer available due to censorship, many people @MONTH1 even decide that they don't want to go to the library anymore. What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy. Censoring material would be like telling a reader that their opinions were not as important as those of the people who found it offensive. I believe that if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available to check out at the library, first think to yourself what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things. Because after all, what you think is offensive @MONTH1 be the best thing in the world to someone else."
1,"If a people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and exetra then they will if they feel it is offensive to others. I wish they would not ,but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so. They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing then they will feel it is okay to say or do thoughs things that they read or hear. It also commine sence to not do thoughs things that people wrote about. The auther's wright things to intertane and to egicate us about things that where okay in the time peroid that the story in this case was okay back then.     Most people these day take things way to serous now mostly because we have things like lawsuits and dercrimation. If someone can find something to complane about they will do so. if there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1's had slave's and if there calling them a name that is not very nice. Then someone and complain and say that it is rashal and there will be a disbute about it and the auther will most likely loose and have to change that word into something els. People do not relise how much this happens it happens a lot expeshally with books.      Movies are a whole different thing now the things that happen on the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with. There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4. @CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1. There are serten things that can be in though's movies. @CAPS2 @NUM1 there can be a lot more things it can be scarry to an extent and there also sometimes sexual things ,but they do not show the whole thing. There also can be villons and some swaring not a lot though. @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that's a whole new level they can have anything they really want and its a little more than @CAPS2 @NUM1 they kind of have a little more graphic than @CAPS2 @NUM1. Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4 it depends on how graphic things are.     Music is a whole other thing depending on what kind of music you are lissening to like theres @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and exedra. with all thoughs they talk about sex and volints. Now all of them excepent contry talk about drugs and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1. There are some that talks about more things, but most of them thats what they talk about. If perents do not want there childeren lissening to it then they do not lissen. there are ways of still lissening to it. most radio stations they can not swre on the radio, but they just cut it out. there are ways to have the uncut version, but thats on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player. There are ways to get around it.     See i think that it is dumb to take things like that away mostly, because they are going to see or hear about it someday anyways expeshally when they are in high school. Most teens do things with out there parents knowing and when they start driving they can lissen to whatever they want. Also they can read anything they want too, because they can buy the book and read it and hid it. Face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do. Matter what age they are they find ways to do what they want if they want it bad enoff. I think if a school wants to read something than they should have to have parents exent about it and if the kids can not read it than they can do something els insted or read something els. Do not take thing off the shelve just, because a couple of students can read or watch it. Your spoilling it for the kids that want to and can it is really unfair to the rest of the students they can not hepl it that there parents wont let them. If the parents won't then try to talk to them and tell them about it help them understand. Also people should have to watch what they do just because theres a kid the parent should leave them with a babysiter or something."
1,"Censorship in Libraries     Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come accross a book from the early @DATE1's? In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away.     When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it?  Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf.          Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature. A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you.     Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems.     So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers"
1,"Do you want your children to have bad images in their head? Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want? I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have no business being in libraries. These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them.     First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material. This material can create a very ambitious young child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents. I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time.     Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual.     Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material.     Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material. In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out.      Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library @MONTH1 have. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed."
1,"The media is a strong influence on society today. In fact, so much of what is delivered to the public comes with ratings or warnings before the program is even played. However, this process arises the question of whether or @CAPS1 our books should come with a 'Do @CAPS1 @CAPS2' label as well. The answer is no. Libraries should @CAPS1 be allowed to censor books because it is an unjust, opinionated, and insolent act.     To begin with, censoring one author's book as opposed to another's is a violation of equal rights. As part of the constitution states, citizens are allowed freedom of speech. This covers the idea of freely expressing one's opinions through writing. It is unjust for any library to remove an author's book based on what they have to say while leaving another's. The author whose publication is being censored has just as much right to voice his/her opinion as the next author. If a citizen does @CAPS1 agree with the author, the book should @CAPS1 be removed but simply passed over on the specific citizen's reading list. By removing any book on a shelf, libraries are taking away the legal right to freely express one's own viewpoint.     @CAPS1 only is removing library books from shelf unjust though, it is also an opinionated act. Every human being sees the world through their own eyes and judges it by their own experiences. Much of what authors write relate to their own life encounters or observations. Therefore, what one author writes about could relate to one reader while entirely offending another. However, this does @CAPS1 mean libraries should be allowed to remove it from the shelves. As the famous author @PERSON1 once said, '... if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no  books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, Paterson is saying that since opinions vary so greatly from one person to the next, then if libraries were allowed to pull every 'offensive' book off the shelf the library would be empty. This is because eveyone's opinions vary greatly and what one person might think is different than the next's. Therefore, libraries should @CAPS1 be able to censor books because it is a heavily opinionated act.     The last point that should be made is censoring libraries is inconsiderate to @CAPS1 only the author but the general public. When one removes a book from the shelf, he/she is preventing another from having the ability to @CAPS2 it. This gesture is @CAPS1 only then rude to the reader, but the author. In removing the author's book, one is degrading on the author's hard work put forth into creating the publication. The amount of time and effort put into publishing a book to then have it unseen to the public eye would be unheard of. @CAPS1 only this, but the public has just as much right to be able to @CAPS2 every book released to them as the author does to convey his/her's messages.. As a result, censoring in public libraries would be insolent to both readers and authors.     It should be made known though that many would argue about children and what these books expose them to. However, most libraries are categorized by age or matuirty level and then genre. Thus forth it is more so the parent's responsibilty to monitor where the child picks up a book from than the responsibilty of the library to censor it's selections. There is also the common argument of media influence. This influence is unavoidable though. In modern society, the media is everywhere and what one doesn't @CAPS2 in a book they are sure to come across on the internet, television, or even newspaper. Thus forth, to censor our libraries would mean having to censor other areas of media as well which again arises injustice and matter of opinion.     All in all, the point to be made is that there should @CAPS1 be censorship in libraries. Public opinion is a very controversial matter, but to pull the media further into it would be to ask for destruction. Censoring the freedom to express yourself is unjust and insolent. It also leads to the popular topic brought about in @PERSON2's @DATE1. If the public allows the government to censor our libraries, what will they truly start to censor from us?"
1,"Literature, the quest for knoweldge. Can selct forms of  knoweldge harm our youth? The @NUM1 century @LOCATION1 is constantly changing. A parent who once freely went to purchase an ice cream cone after school as a child will no longer allow their children to do the same. The hightened level of supervision is due to the changes in our society that are available to harm children. Libraries are being sought out as danger in a different form. The potential to harm our children through choice language and negative @CAPS9 content is all around them. Parents believe they  have a right to voice their opinion on protecting their children. However, children have to face the harsh fact of reality at some point in their lives.     An example of controversy is @PERSON1, a classic @CAPS1 writer. @PERSON1 has produced numerous @CAPS1 classic novels. However, the time period of @PERSON1's works dates back to a time where certain terms were socially normal. @PERSON1's work entitled '@CAPS3 @CAPS4,' has been questioned in recent journalism reports due to the use of a word associated in current culture as a derogatory term towards @CAPS5 @CAPS6. A parent's worst nightmare is to hear the use of such terms in their child's language. A child will eventually hear the word, if not through a novel such as @PERSON1's '@CAPS3 @CAPS4.' A parent's duty is to educate their children that such terms are not socially acceptable. Exposure to novels containing controversial language should be viewed as a tool to open conversations between parents and their children. Even though a child shouldn't be accessible to these novels until a certain age, an early opportunity is open to start creating a child's basis between what is right and what is wrong. Novels, such as @PERSON1's, should be kept on the shelves to help educate children on right and wrong, as well as @LOCATION1's past.     Books are not the only available materials at circulation desks. Libraries have grown to accomodate the advancing forms of information created in the @NUM2 and @NUM1 centuries. Thus, some libraries have changed their names to the term '@CAPS9 @CAPS10.' A child has access to books, music files, movies, and magazines at today's libraries. However, some materials in a library are intended for adults only. Until a certain age, a parent should guide their child through the library to help choose appropriate materials. A strong foundation of values and the child's intersts should guide the parent and child to choose materials in a library. The parent's responsibility is to help the child distinguish materials intended for their age range from materials intended for adults. Guidance in the early stages of development @MONTH1 help the child in their decision making process in the future. @CAPS9 related forms of information with questionable content should be left on shelves to help parents educate their children of what is appropriate for them. The materials should be left available, so when the child reaches adolescence, they can integrate adult forms of material into their lifestyle to prepare them for the real world.     Children are not the only issue to censorhip. Adults in the library community can be sensitive to select language and images as well. @CAPS9 companies, such as @CAPS11 @CAPS12, have made @CAPS9 forms accessible that block nudity and offensive language. An early adolescent @MONTH1 be able to view this type of @CAPS9 with their parent, as the @CAPS9 does not open the door into confusion and questions on a large scale. Adults @MONTH1 also choose to view this form of @CAPS9 over the non censored versions due to personal taste. However, materials with censorable content should still be made available to the people who would like to utilitze them. Libaries are funded through tax dollars, thus some citizens @MONTH1 feel libraries should serve the community as the community sees fit.     Censorship is a growing issue in this country, that the public must tackle at some point. If parents don't explain adult materials to their children during development, who will? @CAPS1 literature and @CAPS9 crucial to the education of our past must never be forgotten. Reality is growing upon us, and the public must find a new way to interpert reality for themselves, as well as their children. By blocking censorship in our libraries, we can prepare our youth and ourselves for the harsh realities of an ever changing world, and question our morals as to what is right and what is wrong"
1,"Good? Bad? Offensive or not? These are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being?     From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. the author(s) @MONTH1 express what they feel on a given topic. Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. In society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story.      In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. The world will never be perfect! The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @MONTH1 ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. If one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read.      At the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. It will briefly tell you that there is some content they @MONTH1 not be appropriate, that @MONTH1 hurt feelings, and simply offend. It is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not.      Every human is entitled to freedom of speech. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. There are words spoken that will offend many! From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger.      People will always be offended. There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. Not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way. From ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. We are all special; and we all think differently. We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @MONTH1 not.      @NUM1 years ago when i was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. Times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @LOCATION2. As my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly. After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. In less than @MONEY1, @NUM3 blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class.      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way. Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally.      I've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves. That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were.      Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves"
1,"Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing"
1,"Should we censor books in libraries? Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 provides a very valid point. If we start taking off book that we find offensive, there will be none left. Books are meant to provide information and insight into someone's life. If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter. The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity.     Books provide insight into the author's life. Also the things that are happening in history affect the author's tone or style, like @ORGANIZATION1. During his lifetime, @CAPS2 was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to appease the @LOCATION1. It also helped appeasing the @LOCATION1 since he was sponsoring @ORGANIZATION1's plays. Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be @CAPS3. He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly saw oppressive things like serfs. When he wrote his tales, he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side. @CAPS3 was not afraid to displease the @LOCATION1.     If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson said. Where one might find information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa. Every book would have someone say it was offensive. It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it; it does not matter. Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive. However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books. It builds the tone and mood of the story or character. It might create a certain image. It also teaches us not to what these people are doing. The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life. These stories teaches us life lessons. Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like does not mean someone else does not. It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it. I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me. It revolves us as a whole, and if someones starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same. It would not be fair.     Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity. It also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them. I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone. I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society.      Books are important to have. They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience. It is important to be aware of what is going on around you. I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occuring in society. My parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society. Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like. So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up. I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after. Unfortunatley most do not, but there are some that have a happy life. That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad. So @PERSON2 was wise in her observation. Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this processes has started?"
1,"Imagine. Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life.     My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or  in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences.     My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about.        You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something.     Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life. Life's to short. Might as well enjoy it"
1,"When I was in seventh grade I had a mission to read every @PERSON1 book I could get my hands on. Some of the material in her books proved to be a little too racy for most middle schoolers and some parents had apparently deemed it inapparopriate and our school librarian had made the decision not to carry it in the school's library. I was devastated, there would be no way my mother would agree to buy me all twenty some odd books that @PERSON1 had written and I didn't have enough money from my meager allowance and various lemonade stands to purchase them myself. Back then, this censorship which banned my favorite books from ever showing their covers in our school's library, bothered me immensely. I couldn't understand why some people's parents @MONTH1 view some of the subject matter in her books as too mature for our age group. However, I am having a change of heart. Now I can understand why our school's library @MONTH1 not be so fond of carrying books with racy aspects to them. That is why I believe that in school libraries, some books should be censored or marked mature. In public libraries though, these books should not be censored.      Books need to be censored in school libraries because some children @MONTH1 be too immature to handle the subject matter within the book's pages. Most parents want their children to stay as innocent as possible for as long as possible and I can respect this idea. Having advanced books would also make the school look bad as not all parents would be on board with the idea and some would complain about their children reading something which they didn't intend them to find out about for many years to come.      Not all censorship has to do with sex. Another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type. The real-time war story which depicts the horrors of fighting for one's country and juxtaposes is with the thought that was is valiant and something to be applauded in the people back home. Some of these stories can get very graphic as to convey the point that war is not all fine and dandy and all it seems cracked up to be. These type of stories are important for our culture to prevent any misconceptions we @MONTH1 have or try to prevent them from a young age by shocking the reader. War should not be perceived as something fun and exciting and young @CAPS1 should know that so when they reach the age of signing up for the military they don't go into it misguided. In these instances, these violent stories are important for our youth to see and I think that they should not be censored in the library.      One @MONTH1 raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence. I am not advocating that books with unecessary violence be put on the shelves. I believe that the books with violence which helps to convey and important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries.      Public libraries are a far different story. They have different sections for children's literature and adult literature. In school libraries the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers. While in the public library it is the exact opposite, (unless the case in a children's public library). Most public libraries carry mostly adult books and a small section of children's books. In this type of setting it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section, marked mature. The subject matter doesn't really matter but the point of public libraries is to educate our citizens and if what they want to read is violent or sexually explicit then so be it, as long as they are reading at all and using the government funded resources provided for them. If the library was privately owned then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to.     The purpose of libraries is to educate the citizens of this country and try to better them and help them make clear informed decisions based on their prior knowledge. If the books are censored then some messages might not get conveyed and misinformation @MONTH1 run adrift. We must prevent this at any way possible"
1,"I do not think that a book should be removed from the shelves of a library if a few people think that the material is offensive.  A library is a public place where everyone has the right to read, listen to, and watch what they want.  If a child wants to read a book, the parent should be the one to decide if they can read it or not. Everyone should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what they want. They should not have that freedom taken away from them just because some people find it offensive.     Everything could be taken as offensive.  If every single book that had something offensive in it was taken off of the shelves at a library, there would be no books left to read.  Some people are offended by things that others are not offended by at all.  If someone has a problem with a book, song, movie, or magazine at a library, then they just should not read it. It is as simple as that. If a book was removed off of a shelf just because they found it offensive, that person could have just gotten someone else's favorite book removed.  If I could never read my favorite book again because it was removed off of the shelves, I would be devastated.  You can not complain about every little thing in life, you just have to move on.     There are sections at a library for a reason.  They have places for adult books, children books, teenage books, mystery, romance, humor, horror etc. Obviously some books are going to be more offensive than others. People have the right to know what kind of book they want to read before they start reading it. That is why they seperate everything into sections like that.     Offensive language and actions are a part of history.  Some of the best books ever written have offensive language in them.  If the language was censored, it would not make the book what it was. 'To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2', for example, it was written when offensive language was used in just about every sentence. That offensive language was how they talked back then, and if it was removed from the book, it would be like removing a piece of history.      Parents can not censor their children from everything.  Once a child hits the real world after being censored from everything offensive their entire life, they will not know what to do.  Everyone has to deal with a few harsh words or actions every now and then. That is how you learn to deal with them. If a parent does not want their child to read a certain book, they can censor them from reading it in their own home, it does not need to be removed off of the shelf just so that one child can not read it. In all reality, a child will do what they want to do even if they are not aloud to. Parents can try to stop them, but if a child wants to listen to a song that their parent does not like, they are going to find ways to listen to it anyway. I do not think that a parent should go out of his or her way to remove material from a library, because they are not helping anyone out by doing that. They are just going to anger people.     I can understand where some parents are coming from by trying to censor things in libraries. Most are just looking out for what is best for their child. They can not censor their child from everything forever, though. Children grow up into adults. Parents might as well let their child hear or see some offensive material while they are young because this world is full of offensive things and they are going to have to get use to all of it.     Books, songs, movies, and magazines that have offensive material in them should not be removed from the shelves at the library. Some people @MONTH1 enjoy reading, listening to, and watching those things. Everyone has the right to read, listen, and watch them if they want to. It should not depend on other people's opinion over the material. The book, song, movie, or magazine was made for a reason.  If the material was too offensive, it would not be placed on the shelves"
1,"Freedom of @CAPS1     @CAPS2 who reads books, magazines, articles and much more will tell you the exact same thing as the people who listen to music and watch movies; they will all tell you that they dont just like one genre of books or music. They will tell you that they like a variety of books or music and some will end up liking things that others dont. If people want to read a specific genre of book or listen to a certain type of music then let them. Taking books and music off the shelves will satisfy some people but i can gaurantee you that it will also make a lot of people enraged. Taking away books or music is like taking away part of a persons personality.     The first reason I believe that there is no book or music that should be taken off the shelves is because the people who make them spend hours, days, weeks, and probably even months on them so their supporters could like it. I know I have never written a book or made a track in the recording studio but I know the people who do waste a lot of money tryin to make it the best they can. Artist and authors want their supporters to be excited when they hear about the next album or book but that wouldnt be possible if they start removing books and albums. Me personally; I like both music and stories about violence and people who grew up with a very difficult life and made it because I like the story in them it isn't anything other than that it just interest me. For example if I were to go to the store one day to get the newest cd that I have been waiting for its arrival for several months and they took it off the shelf I know for a fact that I will be both confused and disappointed.     The second reason I believe that there is no book or album that should be taken off the shelves is because they are what relaxes and sooths people. When people are hard at work or studying at school they want to go home so they could have some time to relax and they turn on their music or sit down and read a book. I know some people dont really believe that music about violence or life stories could be relaxing but people who could relate to it find it entertaining. When people read books they usually do it to either learn something or to just entertain themselves but why would you try preventing @CAPS3 from learning something? One quote that several of my teachers have told me was '@CAPS3 could take things from you but the thing they could never take from you is your knowledge.' The brain is the most important thing in your body and once you learn something new it goes straight into your memory.     The third reason that I believe that there is no book that should be taken off the shelves is because you will displease hundreds and thousands of people. Those whom believe that certain books or music should be taken off the shelves should just avoid that isle or just not worry about them. Telling somebody what they can or can't read or liaten to is like telling @CAPS3 what they can or can't wear, can or can't eat and even where they can or can't live. It really doesnt make sense that people would care what others think about authors and artist books and music since we have the right to listen to and read anything that catches our attention. Authors and artist have freedom of @CAPS1 just like anyone else so why cant they write and sing what they feel like writing or singing?     In conclusion I think everyone has the right to listen to or read whatever they want. People being themselves is what makes this country and if people weren't able to access the things that sooth and relax them from a hard day of work they just wouldn't be themselves. People come here for the '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' and they should be able to listen to any genre of music and read any genre of books. That is the last and most important reason that i believe no book or album should be taken off the shelves."
1,"In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.      Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that @MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another."
1,"Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this"
1,"Libraries are wonderful places to seek out something that intrests you. Some visitors are very sensitive to what is placed at the library for others to view, and causes some corruption among the visitors. They @MONTH1 become offended by what is placed on the shelves, for everyone to decide their interests, which leads to them wanting to learn more about them. Everyone has their own opinion into what is offensive to them, or not. Even though, some @MONTH1 take offense to what is placed on the self, these materials shouldn't be removed, because of the select few who are taken offense of the certain materials.     Many of the materials are placed into different styles, genres, and age groups. Authors write in styles which showcases their skills for everyone to see. Different styles are created, for everyone to experience and discover their own interests. For instance, children love picture books. Picture books are a marvelous way for children to be entertained while being read to. These pictures also help tell the story. Therefore, children prefer picture books, rather than giant chapter books, from the adult section. @PERSON1 is a great example, for an author who is talented to write for children. His poems and pictures are a wonderful combination to enhance the reading of a young mind.     Another style of writing would be for young adults. This selection of the community, has a some-what developed mind. However, its still developing, still gaining insite. Authors choose to write about romances, adventure tales, and almost anything to grasp the teenager's mind. Grasping the teenager's mind, allows the author to tell a story along with teaching the reader an important life lesson. An example for this selection of people, would be any selection from @PERSON2, a young adult writer, who writes about how beauty comes from within, and how every girl should be treated like a princess, no matter what.     Then there's the adult minds. Adult minds are mostly already fully developed. They all have different opinions on which interests themselves, as a person. This should be taken into consideration, when the library decides to remove some of their selection. Authors should write in a more sophisticated way for this group of people. They are also very picky about what it is they are looking for, and what interests themselves as a person.      The removal of materials, which @MONTH1 be offensive to some people is not the brightest idea, for a library to do. Somethings are offensive to certain people, while it @MONTH1  not be offensive to another. Everyone has their own opinions, interests, likes, and dislikes. By removing these materials, which @MONTH1 cause offense, is a disgrace of the true value of intellect a certain indivial @MONTH1 possess.     Some things, @MONTH1 be needed for school, such as writing, project, and learning topics. These topics might interest the young mind, and they would like to learn more about this certain topic. Some older individuals @MONTH1 take some of the topics, their child or grandchild is learning, offensive but they should know that everyone has their own opinion.      Taking away certain materials, because of the offense of someone's own opinion is uncalled for. If all libraries removed anything that offended someone, they wouldn't have anything left to share with the community. Censorship is not needed in libraries. It is an awful way for them put into the position to descreat the idea that everyone has their own opinion on a certain topic.      With everyone possessing their own opinion, they can be very sensitive and take offense to the littlest of things. People are given the chance to learn something new, by visiting a library. If the library removed any material that slightly offended a single person, everyhthing would be terminated and no one would be able to learn something new. Censorship is not a necessity in a library. Any interest, opinion, topic are necessary for a mind to develop and think. They should be able to learn without anyone constantly telling them about what is offensive or not. Nothing should be removed from the libraries of the community, for a learning mind is a healthy mind. We need a place to learn more about a specific topic besides school. So please keep the materials in the library, for everyone to have an opportunity to learn something new or in more depth."
1,"Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-@CAPS1 movies, most children under @NUM1 cannot watch them. Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people @MONTH1 find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offened someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read.      Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-@CAPS1 movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question '@CAPS3 do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give.     In this situation I am somewhat nuetral. I dont object to having things that might offened other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries @CAPS3 children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just @MONTH1 be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.     The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries @MONTH1 not be a smart idea if it's @CAPS3 most children get there books. Parentscan always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children  to see or know of any sort of things that @MONTH1 be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library @CAPS3 a child might get ahold of it.     The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically  saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions."
1,"When you take material off a library shelf, are you taking away an opportunity to learn? Censorship in libraries is a controvercial subject. Should offensive material be taken off shelves so people don't have the opportunity to be offended? No material should be taken off library shelves because taking something off its shelf takes away an opportunity to learn something new, discover a new apreciation, form an opinion, and come to better understand the world that we are living in.     Library censorship is a controvercial subject mainly because what different people find 'offensive' varies. Morals, ehtics, race, gender and anything else that impacts how you think can determine what you believe should be censored in a library, or anywhere else for that matter. What you think should be censored, however, is probably not exactly what others around you think. You @MONTH1 think that a certain type of music should not be placed on the library shelves, while others @MONTH1 think that your favorite song is wildly innapropriate and offensive. If you take the music off the shelf that you think is unreasonable then that gives others grounds to take off things that you @MONTH1 enjoy very much as well as anything else then please. @CAPS1 goes for anything in a library: books magazines, movies, and more.     Who is to say what you should have the priviledge of knowing and what you shouldn't? If library censorship is taken to the extreme, who is to say what should be kept and what should be thrown out with the garbage? These are questions that, in themeselves, would cause controvercy! Library censorship would be replacing one offensive act with another. @CAPS1 issue, perhaps would be even harder to deal with. If one person has the right to take something off the library shelf than anyone has the right to take something they feel is unneeded off the shelf as well. If @CAPS1 continued, there would be nothing left to read, watch, or learn from. There is not a single piece of material in a library that is not controvercial or does not offend anyone or any group.      Though, everything is controvercial in some aspect, that does not mean that anything should be thrown out, never to be read or viewed again. @CAPS1 would take away an opportunity to learn; to understand! Just as everything is controvercial or offensive to someone, also every piece of material in a library has information that is valuable! If something isn't valuable it would not be published. If no one enjoyed a piece of material than it wouldn't have been written in the first place. Even if something has seemingly no value to you, it might be the very thing that someone else treasures more than anything else. A piece of material has value when someone can glean information from it, when someone can form an oppinion about something, when someone can compare and contrast views, or when you can better understand the world around you because of it.     When you take material off a library shelf, are you taking away an oportunity to learn? Yes! Every book, movie, magazine, or song is offensive to someone because everyone has a different view of what offensive is to them and to the people around them. If one thing is taken off a library shelf, everything must be taken off their shelves! Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 truly puts my point into perspective. Every piece of material in a library is valuable to someone (otherwise it wouldn't be there). Also, I can say from personal experience, anything can become valuable to someone if they are given the oportunity to read it, view it, or listen to it. No material should be taken off library shelves because taking something off its shelf takes away an opportunity to learn something new, discover a new apreciation, form an opinion, and come to better understand the world they are living in"
1,"Censorship?  What is it?  Well from what i know cenorship is where you are blocked from certin things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it.  So the question is it wrong to censor something or not, i think that libraries should be able to censor certins things that people find offensive.  First reason why i think it is right that people should be able to censor things is becuase little childeren could be able to take at peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies.  Next reason why i think labraries should be able to cenor is because people can find centin things offensive just as music, for example like vulgar language can be listened to and aslo also naughty things can be watched in movies.  My last reasoning why i think it is fair that libraries are able censor things is beacuase some people like to read but in thier reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a labrary.  These are reasons why i think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines.     My first reasoning in why i think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little childeren could be able to look at things things they should not be able to take a peek at.  Thses things could be like pronogaphy, and also really grusome things in magazines and in movies.  If these things were in labraries they can possibly show other childeren, inwhich it would not be good.  This can be a problem beacuase parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children.  Also i think think they should be able to censor movies beacuse little childern shouls not be watching gursome movies at a young age.  This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines.  Also labraries can censor music.      I also think libraries can censor music beacause in music these days there are very bad things that any body can find that is offensive.  Little childern can be listenig to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people.   This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying,  so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners.  Also they should be able to censor movies again beacuse naughty things can be shown in those movies that certin age levels should not be able to see.  These are ressons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies.   They aslo have right to censor books.      Books in they libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certin books such as books about faith and other religions.  And also about gursome items.  Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people @MONTH1 not see eye to eye about other religions.  And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so peolpe won't find it be offensive.   And also libraries should be censoring certin books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive.  So this is why i think libraries should be able to censor things.     In conclusion libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death,  movies beacuse in some movies it can show pronography and gursome things that peopel should not be watching,  and they should be able to censor magazines and music beacuse in magazines childern could be looking at certin things they shouls not be looking at.  And they should be able to censor music beacuse peopel can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language.  So in other words i do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines"
1,"How @CAPS1 you feel if you saw your kid yelling at an innocent young child? When you ask him/her where they heard that language from they reply, 'I read it from a book I checked out from the @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS1 you be all right with that? OR @CAPS1 you rebel against letting kids that young check those books out?      I @CAPS1 never want my kid to pick up a book and see the way a racist man talks to a @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and think it is all right for them to treat others the way that man did. Most books have a meaning and show ways of life. While others show how cruel the world is by talking about rape, racism, religions, cultures, and people killing each other over nothing but a loaf of bread. I know if everyone could take a book off a shelf there @CAPS1 be no more books in the world. Our kids @CAPS1 never know the stories we know, the ones we have read, and they @CAPS1 @CAPS5 be getting the high reading level they need for their age. Every parent should first understand that apart of education is learning about history, (slavery, @NUM1, @NUM2..ect.) and @CAPS5 all of it is going to be as sweet as getting roses on your birthday. Some of it is going to be nasty and bloody, but something teachers and parents should really stress to their kid(s) is that is how the world @CAPS4. Today the world is no longer like that and treating others with disrespect is @CAPS5 going to be tollerated anymore.      When you walk into a @ORGANIZATION1 they should have books that are rated like movies. If a book is @NUM3, you must atleast be thirteen to check the book out on your own, or you @MONTH1 check it out with a parent present only! If a book has a large amount of curse words and racial slurs a letter @MONTH1 be sent home, or a phone call should be made to the parent making sure it is all right for the child to check the book out. There are some books out in the world I @CAPS1 rate @CAPS6, and I feel as if you should be mature enough and old enough to read those books. Books like '@CAPS7 @CAPS8' are great for anybody through ages @NUM4 to read, it should be rated @CAPS9 because of violence, and very few cursing. '@CAPS10', '@PERSON1', and 'The @CAPS11 @CAPS12' are all children books that could be rated @CAPS13, even @CAPS14-fiction books could be rated @CAPS13 if it suits the childs reading level.      One more solution could be to @CAPS5 even put books up that are racial, abusive to other countries, religions, and cultures on the book shelves of a public @ORGANIZATION1. That @CAPS1 surely solve the problem of our children reading them, and feeling that it is right for them to do the same things the people in the book did. If you want to read a book that has any of that inside of it, I feel that you should spend your own money and go buy it. When you are done you could return the book back to that place and get your money back if you wish, you can also donate the book to '@CAPS16' or, you can keep it for yourself.     The very final thing they could do to solve this problem is to have two seperate libraries, one for adults and the other for children and teens. The @CAPS17 @ORGANIZATION1 could hold most of the books that have cursing, racism, and sbusive things. While the @CAPS18/Children @CAPS19 can have all of the other types of books, for them to read. If for some reason a book your @CAPS18 wants is inside of the @CAPS17 @ORGANIZATION1 and you allow them to get it, you @MONTH1 esscort them inside and be with them when they get the book they are wanting. When your child is old enough to drive is when they are old enough to enter the @ORGANIZATION1, as long as they have their I.D with them.      I never want my child to pick up a racial book a think it is okay to treat people wrong and with disrespect. That is why I feel these @CAPS1 be the best solutions to keep this from happening."
1,"Censorship is a tricky concept. It is a word that can ban music from stores, books from shelves, and movies from theaters. Katherine Paterson, an author, said that if all things reading or listening materials were removed, nothing would be left. I thoroughly agree with that statement. If someone finds one aspect of a work offensive, that does not qualify for the work to be banned or discarded. I believe offensive material should not be removed because of the following reasons: it suppresses the feelings of the author, nothing will be left on the shelves, and there is no defining line on what is or is not offensive.     Now, I understand there is a vast amount of people who are against my position. I assure them that I understand those feelings. Some audiences feel that the removal of offensive material is good because it shields the ears of those who cannot handle the verbage or context. Others @MONTH1 feel that sensitive audiences @MONTH1 not be comfortable with the text. In addtion, many people believe that exposing people to violent, risky, and material with dangerous habits will evoke the same behavior in young children. Though these are all valid opinions, they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves.     Contrary to the opinions of others, I believe one reason @CAPS6 material should be kept on the shelves because if it is not on the shelves, the the thoughts and feelings of the writer will be suppressed. For instance, the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' was banned for a long time. Harper @CAPS3's book, @MONTH1 have had some slurs we @MONTH1 find offensive today. However, that is the way people in that time spoke. Who are we to fault the people of the @DATE1 and @DATE2 for how that articulate words? By banning 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' for the time frame that it was banned, generations were robbed of the powerful and beautiful meaning of the entire book. That meaning was that you cannot punish the innocent because they have done nothing wrong. The same for done for @CAPS6 book. @CAPS6 one reason why I believe that should stay on the shelves.     Next, works of literature and music should stay on the shelves because as Katherine Paterson said if everyone removes a book, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 is very true. Many books have been on the banned book list. For instance there is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' '@CAPS9 in the @CAPS10,' '@PERSON2,' and the like. What book will be removed from the shelves next? Once society is relieved of all literature, the next step will be music. Look at the singer/songwriter @PERSON3. He made some very sexually themed music. When people bought his records in the @DATE3, they had to be covered or placed in brown papered bags. They @MONTH1 be considered censorship, but that is one step away from being banned. His record company refused to produce his music under his name because of the scandalous lyrics. Because of that, @PERSON3 has changes his name to an unpronouncable symbol. What will be next?     Finally, my last reason for why offensive material should not be removed is because who is to say whether or not something is offensive? A novel or song @MONTH1 be pleasing to @NUM1 people, but should it be extinguished from the record store or library because of one person? I do not think so. There are many words and concepts that have not be socially accepted of the centuries. However, those same appalling concepts have become accepted if not an uncommon habit.  If @CAPS6 'offensive material' is given time, it will become unoffensive in the years to come.     For all the reasons I have stated, I do not agree with removing anything off the shelves because something finds it to unacceptable if not offensive. If everything is removed because of an opinion, the world of the arts will be no more. Then, we as people will wonder what will be left of us. We will be nothing more than a mass of narrow-minded and ignorant individuals who know nothing about books, music, magazines, movies, etc. Now, I pose @CAPS6 question to you: If all was deemed offensive material, what would be left?"
1,"Offence is in the eyes of the beholder.  Different people find different things to be offencive, but everyone will find something offencive in thier lives at some point in time. Just because the mother of a five year old doesn't want her child reading a book series such as @ORGANIZATION1', a series filled with swearing, death, killing, and sexual induendos, doesn't mean that noone should be able to read these books.  If libraries cencored all work that someone found offencive there would be next to nothing left on the shelves, just for the fact that almost anything recorded or writen will offend someone at some point in time.  People live with offence everyday and what some people find offencive is not what others take offence to, if people are offended @CAPS13 something then those people should just not read it, and if they don't want their children to read it then they can keep it from thier children, but they have no right to take it away from everyone else.     In my readings I have read many offencive and abrasive things, but to some they are not offencive.  One key book that comes to mind is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. In this book black people are often refered to @CAPS13 a word that in todays' society is not correct to say but in the society that it was written in the words they used were used on a daily baisis.  Some modern readers find this material to be offencive, but the reason that they do is because it's frowed upon @CAPS13 todays society when in all reality all that it is is our history.     Another book series that people often take offencivly is called '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 Materials' and includes the books 'The @CAPS6 @CAPS7', 'The @CAPS8 @CAPS9', and 'The @ORGANIZATION2'.  In this series the government is trying to find and destroy a higher power, comparable to the modern day @CAPS10 of @CAPS11.  This book is very contriverical and full of killing swearing and other things that are very taboo for todays day and age.  One of the biggest taboos in this book is the fact that they look at religion in a light that the church doesnt really like, but at the same time it's bringing religion into the picture so seperation of church and state makes it so that many schools wont keep it.     One more highly contriverical book I have read was 'The @CAPS12' @CAPS13 @PERSON2.  This book is a story of a mans trip  to and through @CAPS14 while being led @CAPS13 a counciler named @PERSON1.  @PERSON2 takes a very odd veiw on @CAPS14 and describes punishments that people should face for thier sins, such as burning eternaly, drowning, being frozen broken and put back togther and so on.  This book is not right for a five year old to read, but overprotective parents and a government should not take that right away from those of us who could actually take something from these books.     These books, and alot of books for that matter, are full of contrivercy, anger, and a lot of parents don't want thier children reading them. Alot of these parents don't want thier children to read them because they are afraid of offence.  As soon as someone says something offencive parents and teachers go on the defencive. They don't want anyone to ever be offended because if they are then they @MONTH1 get sad. I'm speaking melodramaticly of course but the point im trying to make is the fact that parents and schools are trying to protect thier kids to the point of smothering them.  Schools complain about reading scores being so low, but its a wonder why they are when they take away half of the books worth reading because someone took some sort of offence to it.  People get offended everyday, but I feel that our society trys to hide children from that truth, which is ok for a while but then when they grow up, they'll be lost and they will just cry to mommy the first time someone says or does something offencive. If someone takes offence to a book I don't expect them to read it, but it is not thier right, @CAPS10 or government given, to take that away from the rest of us in this country."
1,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As @CAPS1, we have certain @ORGANIZATION1 that we are guarenteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what liturature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today.     In the @CAPS2, the @CAPS3, and the @ORGANIZATION1, we are given certain @ORGANIZATION1. Some of these @ORGANIZATION1, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been contricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We @MONTH1 not have 'lost' these @ORGANIZATION1, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat?     Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples on why censorship of written liturature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writting a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of it's countries youth.     Some @CAPS4 classics are also being speculated against. The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2 has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies. But because time has changed it's meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an @CAPS4 classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'.     Censorship is not only taking place in written liturature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers.     Music is one of the biggest part of our society today. With the invention of iPods and @NUM1 devices, music has become much more common, and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it @MONTH1 seem offensive to some citizens, but others @MONTH1 just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you @MONTH1 not listen to that,'? This should not be allowed, yet it is.     How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the @ORGANIZATION1 of our great countries citizens, and the @ORGANIZATION1 of individuals like yourself.                                                                 Sincerely,                                             @PERSON1"
1,"Censorship should be taken seriously the conciquences can affect our youth. When a child is in a library they want to look around and explore, but when the libraries have subjects on drugs, alcohol, teen pregnacy and abortion they are fueling the curiousity of a young childs mind. With the way the media and authors of books are these days you see more vercitile writing than in previous years. People are more open to talking about sex, drugs and teen pregnancy because its an every day occurance to many.      When a elementary or high school student goes into a library and can pick up a book about drugs, alcohol, teen pregnancy and sex that is very inappropreate. I have walked into my own library at my school and have read books about drugs, sex, gay marriage  and many other disterbing topics. Also at my school middle schoolers, twelve and thirteen year olds, can pick up these same books. Books like these should not be sitting on the shelf for young high school students to read. It seems like the young gergeneration are learning more and more at a younger age, things children should not know. It is wrong that a high school library can help that out and provide books on these offensive topics.      The books at our library are filled with things that some kids @MONTH1 find offensive or to much to hear, but what about the parents? The parents of the children should be asking the school board or librarians what they are allowing their child to pick up and read on a day to day basis. Parents should be going to their local library to see for themselves what their children have all day access to, if they knew they wouldn't like it. Parents need to make sure that their childs school is safe. Having material like gay marriage, teenage sex, drugs, alcohol and other things is not safe for the child. It is introducing them to topics they should not find out about until they are much older. Some topics that are talked about in gossip magazienes and books have very strong opinions, that means someone elses opinion on these sensitive topics are being brought to your childs attention. Parents should be able to trust their local library to keep your child safe and away from these topics, but now parents have to worry what their child picks up from the library. The libraries should not limit the kids on what they don't have access to, but what they do have access to.      Movies in the library are also very contrevercial. I have looked at some movies in the library and wondered if that should really be on the shelf. There are movies that have drugs, alcohol use, sexual scenes, and gay material. The movies also have the ratings such as @CAPS1, @NUM1, or @CAPS2, but in the library a middle schooler can pick out a movie no matter what the rating is and take it home. The parent would have no idea what their child is watching. Parents should be able to trust the librarians to follow the ratings and to be smart. Another thing a child has access to in the library is magazienes. Magazienes are a good sorce of news, current events, politics and much more. Some magazienes are good but some are gossip magazienes that have very high views on certain topics.  I have a subscription to the magaziene @CAPS3. This magaziene has many topics that I would never want to show my little sister. The magaziene has gossip articles, current event artices, then the 'sensitive' aritcles about things like gang rapes, drug abbuse, alcohol addiction, bullying, sex, and @ORGANIZATION1's. These are not things that young girls, or boys should have access to. Libraries have these types of magazienes on the shelf and they allow anyone who wants to check them out to do that.      Our childrens libraries should be a safe learning enviroment, but they shouldn't be learning about certian topics. Library censorship should be taken in to account, the kid affected are our nations future. This is a very serious issue that could be happening in the best schools in the best places. The kids being affected by this could be your own. Are you going to change it"
1,"Censorship in Libraries                                   @CAPS1: @ORGANIZATION1 in libraries is most likely a common issue in all public libraries. Books, movies, music or magazines could effect colors based on racism, violence, or other issues that people have. Some people have different beliefs or concerns about what should be put in libraries. I believe the reason why libraries have certain books is for some people like to learn about topics or different kinds of history.          I believe that movies, books, or anything other kind of resource in a library should be allowed to be in there. I know that most libraries have different sections for types of books like fiction and non-fiction. I think that in all libraries, there should be certain sections for movies, music, books, magazines and more. I understand that some people have issues with what is in libraries. For instant, some parents think that movies that contain vugar images or have violence in them should not be in the library. I think that the library should have everything, some people like to rent movies to see action and other things. I do think that nude images on a movie should be put on a higher shelf or in a different section just for grown ups, but other than that I think everything should be put in libraries.      The library is a resource to learn more about anything that you would like to learn about. Libraries have different types of books, mostly anything you would like to learn or read about is at the library. At libraries in schools, they usually do not have movies or vugar books. In schools, the librarian still has books and magazines. Libraries have books about times in the past, novels, short stories, poems, and much more. The library is a place to learn new information or just to research a topic for a school project. Usually when people go to the library and check a novel or short story out, they just want to enjoy a good book.      In my own experience, my mother and I went to the public library in @LOCATION1 to rent a few movies. My mom told me to go pick out a couple movies, so I went over @CAPS1 the movie section and just grabbed a movie that look descent and went over to my mom to give it to her. She took the movie and read the back of it and said that it looked like a good movie. We rented it and took it back home. At home, I was excited to see a new movie, so we started to watch it immediately. The movie was going great and it was really funny. About the middle of the movie, it started to get very vugar. Luckily, I was mature and took the movie out, I did not want to watch it anymore.      I think that even though a movie does not say that it has rated @CAPS2, does not mean it doesn't have vugar images in it. I know that I have seen images and read things that I did not want to, but I still think that libraries should have the freedom to have what they would like in their libraries. I do admitt that librarian's should have movies and books sorted better for the benefit of children. Other topics about the library could be that people do not want to see certain colors of people, but I think the should just grow up and go on with life. Black people and white people are living together and are civil.      I believe that censorship is common in libraries. Books, movies and resources in libraries do have things like violence, racism, and vugar images in them. A library has all of these types of things because some people like to watch and learn about certain things. A lot of people do have their opinions of what should be in the libraries, mostly parents, they would like their children to go to the library to learn and research what they like and not be seeing things that they should not. I believe that the reason why libraries have certain is for the people who like to learn about different topics or history. I would like to thank you for letting me write my concerns and opinions"
1,"I believe that the books, music, movies, magazines should be removed if they are really offensive. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean that it would be to another person. Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two but, not everyone. So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelfs because, who is really going to be offened by and are they really offened by this matter or aspect.      Also, I believe that some people might lie about if they are offened by it just so that they will take it off the self. Maybe, there is a movie for example, that there is a lot of bad words, I could see them being able to take that off the self because, a lot of people don't like those words to be used and thats understandable. If they are just taking it off the self tho for one little thing I don't think that should be aloud.     I think that if that person is getting offened by what a book said or a movie said then don't read it or don't watch it. No body is forcing you to watch or read a book that you don't want to. Reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say.      I believe that this really has to go down to what the persons beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day which means that they probably aren't going to be watching the movie ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2.'  They are going to pick a movie more suitiable to their life style and what their use to. Maybe they had a friend that suggested that they should watch a movie and they did, they might have taking offensivness to that, but that was also there choice they didn't have to watch it.      If this was the case to take a book, movie, music out because someone was offened then there would be nothing left. Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said ' this book offened me, I want you to take it off the self.' I'm sorry but, I'm having a hard time believing that your going to listen to every single person that comes in a says that. Also, @CAPS3 do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book? My guess is no because you don't want to deal with that many people about one or two maybe even five books.     I'm not saying that people don't get offened by somethings that books and movies say but, your going to have a lot more then just one person come in and say that there are more then just one book or movie. so then there would be no books left. What if you have someone come in and they request that they have a certain movie and you say ' @CAPS4, I'm sorry we had to take that movie off the self because, it offened someone.' I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do.     Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down and they say that it was a very nice movie are you going to listen to them also if you listen to one person don't you think that its fair if you listen to the other person also that likes the movie. I am a person that believes theres two parts to every story. So, therefore, I think that you should listen to both sides or keep what you have if that person wants to take it off the self then do it but, if someone asks for that specific one then I would let them have it because that isn't going to hurt the person that got offened by the book or movie is it.     Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies and music all on the seleves unless more then one person complains then it would be a different story."
1,"Censorship in libraries is something that helps to keep children away from harmful and adult like content. Not all libraries are for just children. Adults, young teens, and children can attend a library for many reasons. Books take a big part in research for school, reading for fun, or even facts for work. There are many different types of books that are available. What if there was an important book that maybe an adult or young teen needed? Would you want to take away from their educational time? Censorship is not always a right way to go.     Going to the library, there are many things that you can do. Reading of course is the main activity you can do. At a library there are always computers for people to be on. If you go to school and need a place to have a study group or even do homework it is a liable place to be. There are many different maturity levels between adults and children. Depending on what the library showcases, or maybe the types of books they hold, it might be more for adults. Being a parent you should know where your kid is, and trust them for what they do. If you can't trust your kid  to be responsible, then do you not think that you should keep them away from the negative. Libraries are not negative it is just the information in some books, or some that are displayed @MONTH1 require to be a little mature about it.      Kids these days do pick up things they see and hear from adults and elders they are around, but that is not the only thing. A kid can easily read a book that has either drugs or sex involved situations that @MONTH1 trigger something inside of them. Next thing you know, your kids are doing these non explainable things that you never thought they would. Kids should be monitored and so should books, music, movies, and magazines they offer at a library. There are many aspects to being appropriate for kids. Books, music, etc. should not have foul language, drugs, sex, or gang related issues. If any do, it should be for young teens or adults that can handle that type of maturity.      Offensive aspects that might have a book or anything else taken off the shelf would be if it was something negative towards a religion or race. People might follow a religion heavily and then there are books that offend them with a tradition or thing they might do in their house hold. Those type of books @MONTH1 be asked not to display. Sometimes though, the books religious people do not want displayed are the books people need for research purposes with work or school. With the whole racial issue it could be anything that happened historically. Some @MONTH1 take it offensive because they did not agree with what happened in those events. Those books can also be helpful in research for work or school. Being asked to not display those would only help them not everyone else. It is most likely a self opinionated situation when someone thinks a book should be removed. In the quote Katherine Paterson wrote she mentioned '....And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'      With Katherine's quote being said, some believe that @MONTH1 be right. Personally, I completely agree with Katherine. If someone does not like a book, what about the rest? Then there would not be any books for other people. Basically what she is saying is that when people have their own opinions on books or materials held in a library it is not always just about them. Do they ever think of the other people that might want to review that item? Doubtful as the situation @MONTH1 seem, they are just going to have to include insight for other people besides themselves. To you and I that means that the person is selfish and does not think about anyone else but theirselves. Libraries are meant for finding your resources, and gaining information about many topics. So, no I do not believe that books, music, movies etc. should be taken off of the shelf because of one persons thought. Think about others and not just yourself"
1,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     @CAPS1 of us would agree with Katherine Paterson when she said that there are books we hope our future generations do not chance across. @CAPS1 of us would also agree that she made a very good point when she said that if any of us present-generation people were granted the ability to take the said books from the shelves, there would no longer be any reading material for anyone to read. Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities?     I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence,  and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail.  Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands.     There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age.     Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need.  Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their  discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material.     In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset"
1,"Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'"
1,One thing i do now about censorship and it is that @CAPS14 every one has to like it so if you see it well and you dont like it well all's I can do is who cares what you thank because im pretty gosh darn sure that some one eles out there in the world @CAPS2'@CAPS3 mind it and im @CAPS14 saying they do like it its @CAPS15 that they doen'@CAPS3 mind because its something thats apart of life.     I can remeber a time when I got a book out about this old idian trib i had to do a writing esay. The only thing they whore was @CAPS15 like some cloth around there wastes the girls or guys did @CAPS14 have tops in the pictures well my partner had to take that book home for the night so he could do some work with it because I had it the night befor well I guesss when his mom got home she did @CAPS14 like the pictures that was in the book.     The next morning him and I both got called down the the office and the princable wanted to tell us that were going to have to find a different way to @CAPS4 @CAPS10 the trib becuase my parners mom called it in and  did @CAPS14 like it one bit. So they @CAPS15 told us that were trying to do a little @CAPS1 well  the way I @CAPS4 at it its that its a part of life and that it was for a @ORGANIZATION1 progect and something like that @CAPS13 @CAPS14 matter its @CAPS15 pictures its @CAPS14 like its the real thing.     So what im trying to get at is that its @CAPS14 right for some of that becuase then how eles are we going to lern besides the internet because here at the @ORGANIZATION1 are internet dont work all the time so sometimes if were doing a progect well then we got to get books. well if the books we need get pulled off the shelf well then i thank that we can get a bad grade because i dont know any teacher here let's you do a whole paper @CAPS15 by getting things off the internet all the prgjecs i have done in my life had to have a book resorc.     but like I said if they pull them off well then we got a problem and we @MONTH1 fail that assiment because the people want to cencer something thats stupid. So who cares if you have a problum with it that dont mean every one @CAPS13 i mean sure if you dont like it thers two things you can do (A) @CAPS2'@CAPS3 @CAPS4! (@CAPS5) @CAPS2'@CAPS3 @CAPS4 THAT @CAPS9 @CAPS10!     See some people @CAPS2'@CAPS3 have a problum with some bad things some people could care less if your being over protective well then I @CAPS2'@CAPS3 know what to tell you because when you or your kids get to the big world your ganna see it every were and so I @CAPS2'@CAPS3 thank we should pull any thing off the shelfs here at @ORGANIZATION1 because us students here re-liy on them to be here when ever we need something about what ever topic it is. It @CAPS15 gots to be here when and were ever we need it.     So I guess if you pull them well your @CAPS11 A student goes to a (A+) down to like a (@CAPS12-) book reports are a big grade here they are alot of your procentig to your english or english lab grade thats what they go off. Yeah sure we have text books but they got stories in them @CAPS14 information what we need theres a difference between a text book and a book. one is @CAPS15 for class the other is for class and reserch and jsut plain out something to read if you love to read. but if you pull them off we all will @CAPS14 know what that trib its what ever done or whore because some techers will @CAPS14 let you get all your information off of the internet so if you got a problum get over it because taht dont mean every one @CAPS13 and @CAPS15 remember this the world @CAPS13 @CAPS14 evalv around @CAPS15 YOU!
1,"Well today i am going to talk to you about censorship in books, Music, Movies, an Magazines  in your libraries, because some of them can be pretty grafic on some of the things they talk about or do in a story. But yes some of them can be more grafic than others, but that doesnt mean you have to take them off the self. Ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff. But some people like to read about murders an gangs selling drugs and thats fine. Its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like. it can be a novel, @ORGANIZATION1. Sports, @CAPS1,  just a true story that has happen to someone, an etc. thats just the part of the world. how would it be if everyone liked the same things. pretty boring right yeah deffentally.  So therefore i dont think books should be takin off the shelfs. it could be the next best story for somebody. you never know.     Now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to. All they talks about is sex, drugs, achole, an etc. But that desnt give you the right to take them off the shelf thats what some people like to listen too. but there is some music out there that dont just talk about that. there is the oldies, country, jazz, hip hop, an etc. but for the most part all music is good its just some of them are better than others, lets take country for instents ya it talks about some sex, an some achole but thats not the whole song they manly talk about country boys an the things they do or have happened to them over time, an they are pretty much right. So all music is good, but without music i dont think the world would be a very nice place. people listen to music all the time. when working out, at work, driving, or just siting at home. So there are some good music an bad muic you make the call.     But with movies there are some movies made just for that reason its all call intertainment for adults. which yes is kinda pointless, but its there an prolly wont ever leave. there are movies made for sex, drugs, an achole. thats just the part of life, everything is not perfect. So in that matter you gota tell your children about this stuff in stop them from watching it at a younge age. because i think it is taking a big role in teen pregnecy, beacuse it they see it an hey it looks fun we shoud try it, and sexual content is so easy to get. its all over the web an etc. its like drugs they are so easy to get. there are meth labs all over for meth. an there is weed all arund. you just gota tell your kids what they can watch an cant. Disney, @ORGANIZATION2, an @CAPS2. are all great shows for kids. so parents be the boss about that stuff.     Now we get to Magazines. there are millions of magazines all aound the world, they are one thing that will never leave this world. they carry news, intertainment, comics, or tips on how to do somethng. thats what is going to be in this world till the world ends. But yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults. but that doesent make them bad people injoy looking at them kinda magazines thats just what people like. its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a @CAPS3. or your daughter from looking at porn. its all apart of life. but you can stop it from happening at a younge age. you just gota get it clear to your child to not look at this stuff till your older. but you cant stop everything. But all i am trying to say is yes there is some bad things out there an their is alot of good things to. but that doesnt give you the right to remove them"
1,"In the world there are things that we find offensive to ourselves and the people around us. Many of them are movies, music, magazines, and books. These examples are created off human experiences and tell things that really happened in someone's life. However, people think these sort of things should be removed from the television, radio, and shelves, so that we are not allowed to see them. The reality is, in the real world you do not get censored from bad things and to prepare kids for life after high school, we should require them to see nudity, violence, and cursing in school.      There are things in movies, books, magazines, and music  you @MONTH1 not find offesive but there is someone out there who does. If you wanted to take away a book that you thought was offensive, then you would be taking away a book that someone else thought wasn't offensive. 'You also have the exact same right and so does someone else. And then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' said Katherine Paterson. Her and I both think every book out in the world is going to be offensive to someone, so if we let someone take away any book they find obsurd then there will be no books to read, and kids will be frightened when they reach the real world and see that bad things do exist.      I think this topic is a lot like kids who are very sheltered by there parents when they are growing up. Kids that can not hang out with friends, go to social events, and can't read or watch some offensive things are at a major disadvantage later in life. I feel that they have a lot to learn when they move out of the house. I think kids should be required to read or see an offensive piece of material. I believe this because if a child has never heard a curse word or see an offensive picture, the first time they see one when they are older, they will freak out and not know what to do. However, if people wouldn't have taken it off the shelf, the child would have seen or read it, and they would know how to handle the situation because of prior knowledge.     In my own experiences, readings,and watchings, I have seen, heard, and read some offesnive things. I think that a lot of factors have played into me seeing and reading different types of material at a semi- young age. Part of it is that I have gone to public school all of my life and you are exposed to many different views at a school that is public. Many kids use curse words in every sentence and as you walk down the hallways, you hear those words. Also in a public school the teacher's are more laid back on the things we see and read. An example is in eighth grade, my @CAPS1 class watched a movie that showed naked women in it. Last year in @CAPS1 class, we read a book that used the @CAPS3- word on every-other page. The other factor is my parents and what they let me see and read. In elementary school they were very scrict on the things that I watched. I never saw a bad movie at that young of an age. In middle and high school, they have backed off a lot and allow me to watch almost anything that peaks my interest. They know the things that happen in adult life and they know the things I will see and read, and they want me to know and learn about these things before I get to college.         In the real world there are many things we find offensive to ourselves and the people around us. Books, movies, music, and magazines are based off human experinces and tell things that happen in someone's life. People think that these things should be removed from shelves, so kids can not see them. The truth is, the real world isn't censored and to prepare kids for the life after education, we need to allow them to see things life nudity, cursing, and violence in school"
1,"Should They or Should They @CAPS1?     What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should @CAPS1 be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion i do @CAPS1 think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them @CAPS1 to be like that?     One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell. So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to?     There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if  I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it. As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was @NUM1 there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats @CAPS1 your problem.      There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or @CAPS1. Books with sex scenes and murder should @CAPS1 be allowed into they @NUM2 year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do. Most @NUM1 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy. As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they have'nt done anything so far is beacuse @CAPS1 enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing.     This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or @CAPS1. Last but @CAPS1 least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books. Some for the youngre kids some for the older. Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and @CAPS1 just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and @CAPS1 let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!!Make a say!!"
1,"Libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials. Within those books, magazines, and movies holds much knowlege, information in the non-fiction selection, and many entertaining and good morals in the fiction selection of books. If libraries began censoring their books, much information will be disclosed for no one in the public to read. The goverment could have multiple reasons as to why they feel certain books should be taken off the shelf. Some possible reasons could be they are racist, send the wrong message to children, or spread knowlege the @ORGANIZATION1 wants to keep away from the common man. Cencoring books would be a horrible idea and affect everyone.      Some books that could easily be considered to be taken off the shelf would be books that are racist, or sugest radical ideas. Everyone in the world is deemed equal and books witch suggest one race, is better than another could offend the readers and for which the @ORGANIZATION1 decides to have it taken off the shelf. Books that suggest radical ideas could also belong in the group of books being taken off the shelf. The @ORGANIZATION1 could be worried that the reader @MONTH1 carry out this radical/terrorist idea and would in return censor them. But censoring these ideas would be denying the public their chance to learn, there are racists everywhere and just because you simply toss the book away, won't suddenly rid the world of racists.      Another cause why books or magazines @MONTH1 be removed from the shelves could be that the send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content. Parents try the best they can to repel the content away from their children, and books they begin to read wether it be on their own or in school could introduce kids of all ages to new content, their parents @MONTH1 not prefer them learning at their age. Parents @MONTH1 have a point, but children can not be protected from everything, they must learn and accept certain ideas as they grow and develop. Parents @MONTH1 be able to censor what their children read in their own home, but to take the books or movies entirely off the shelf would prevent the people, who enjoy or see comedy in these articles, movies, music, or books, to learn aquire knowledge, even if their only purpose of reading is just for laughs.     Censoring @MONTH1 also be introduced into libraries because the @ORGANIZATION1 does not want the public learning and developing ideas on what they think the right idea of doing something is that the @ORGANIZATION1 disagrees with. They @MONTH1 think if people start learning and developing opinions from books they've read, they @MONTH1 start to oppose the @ORGANIZATION1, although people are always going to oppose the @ORGANIZATION1, not everyone will like what is going on, and to have a growing society and economy, knowledgable people are needed to invent develop concepts.     In terms of race and religion, everyone is considered equal, but in terms of level of @CAPS1, everybody varies from one another. Which could be another reason to censor, so the public stays at the same level as their neighbors, so everyone is truely equal. Doing this would once again stop the modernization of the world, smart people would go unrecognized and the inventions that could have been stirring in their heads could turn to a blank thought, which is the same as everyone else's. In the book @CAPS2 @NUM1, Censorship is the main idea in this book. They censor the books so that everyone is truely equal, and even censor so that peoples looks and qualities all are equal to the others. This is not the way to go in @CAPS3 society. The @ORGANIZATION1 would have full control, and knowledge would not be blossoming in the schools.      Even just a little bit of censoring in libraries, whether it be books, magazines, music, or movies, would put a damper in the knowledge and brain power of the society around. Censoing books is an awful idea that should never be put into place. The @ORGANIZATION1 should never be allowed to decide what the public views. It is in everyones own opinion and interest whether they themselves read or listen to the material provided."
1,"Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them."

2,"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June (Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The hotness and heat had also increased the characters confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, Id be fine (Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."
2,"The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclists attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks,  I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story."
2,"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is described as "" the high deserts of California in June,"" (pg @NUM1). So, enjoys cause tell that it is going to be extremely hot act. Not only is it summer time, but the narrator is in the high desert of California. It has to be very hot. As a result, the narrator is extremely thirsty. It is hot dry and the narrator is worrying. I very hard, so it is only natural that the narrator rees uster. The setting also effects the narrator because of where he actually is. The narrator is in the desert, where there is usually not that many houses or buildings. So then the narrator is moveling and reeds to break to get water, there is no where to get water. In many that is the reason the narrator becomes tared and thirsty. If the setting was in a city or even suberts, the narrator could have stopped anywhere of the desperatly needed water at a store, on etc homes, work buildings, etc. But because he is in the desert, there is where to stop and get water, and that effects when negatively. Aten tiles the narrator comes to a place where he thinks be can get water, but be has been recieved. For example, in the test it says ""after forty miles into the pedal, I came to the first town."" The author put quptes around town because it is not a real town. It is so unhabited, lonely ghost town. In another incident,the narrator think he can get water at or upcoming building, but it is actually on abundoned building. If the setting was in a move habited and populated spot, perhaps the narrator could have pottan water, but, also the setting was in ""the high deserts of California."" The setting definately negatively affected the narrator."
2,"The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didnt get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge, By the lols of it had been a Welchs @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory. He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth. There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst."
2,"Many cyclists need to be cautious while riding through difference and unfamilar areas. It can be very dangerous and can cause series;injury. The essay @CAPS1t Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example of what will go wrong if a cyclist doesnt focus on his surroundings or trust his instincts. Many features in the setting affect cyclists such as the condition of the road, the current population status, and weather. A cyclist should know the terrain hes ridcing before starting, so he can understand when he should use his energy at certain times. Kuamaskie took advice from older gentlemen while not paying attention to his map therefore didnt recognize there would be man hills in hi shortcut. Also, the area could be covered by different objects such as rocks, grass ,and living creatures. Joe had no idea what he would run into an his journey, creating problem. It is also important for cyclist to know about the population of people, and status of efficiency. When the narrator hits his first stops he was greeted by abandoned ""ghost towns"" and bad water pumps tasting like acid. These conditions cause problems for cyclists because they need to fill up with water, and die of dehydration. Finally weatheris an important tool to interpret when acting. Climate determines what you wear, how much water you need, and what is expert. Joe Kurmaskie was cooled at first, thinking thing would be cooler while riding with pine trees, where the setting changed to California desert heat, he panicked. Therefore, from the examples shown inRough Road Ahead;Do Not @CAPS2 Posted Speed limit by Joe @CAPS3 maskie along with other pasard knowledge, cyclist should be mindfull of the setting them in order to get the road out of their ride.  "
2,"In the story Rough Road Ahead a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didnt help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found several rusty pumps, and one ramshackle shed. This probably didnt help him because he didnt have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldnt get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldnt setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story Rough road ahead the setting in the story didnt help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didnt help that he was in a desert."
2,"At the start of the trip, after he had received the directions, he started out rather pleased and without worry, as the setting he was in wasnt causing him any problems. By the time he reached the first town, it had become very hot, but it didnt really affect him, as he had plenty of water. By the time he arrived at the second check point, however, he was beginning to get worried. It was getting extremely hot, and he was starting to run out of water. There were water pumps at the checkpoint, but none with water that could quench his thirst. He continued on the blazing day, but he eventually reached some hills that took even more energy to get across. At this point, he was extremely low on water, and he was beginning to worry that he would not survive the trip. Eventually, he reached the next town which turned out to be another abandoned building. This abandoned building however, turned out to be an abandoned welchs Grape Juice Factory, which depressed him even more, as if he had arrived a few years earlier, when it appeared to have been open, he finally would have heard a place to rest and get his energy back. He got back on his bike, but in desperation, he started sucking on rocks in hopes of getting some spit to circulate. However he didnt believe it would be enough, as he thought that the heat and lack of water around him would kill him. However, he finally arrived at a bait shop where he was finally able to get some water causing all his worries to go away. "
2,"There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement I was travelling through the high deserts of California. not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement I was travelling in June. @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also had the flavor of battery acid. This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly. The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink."
2,"In the essay intitled Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening. This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of old-timers. From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first town, a ghost town, The sun was beginning to heat down, This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a A Rough Road Ahead sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood."
2,"The setting of the essay greatly affected the plot of the story. The high deserts of California sets the scene of the story to be a dry hot day. Several feartures of this landscape contribute to the conflicts confronted by the cyclist. The greatest problem that faced the cyclist was the lack of water. This left the cyclist with then fear of getting dehydration or heat stroke. For example, the cyclist said. growing realization that l could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June. This demonstrats his fear of dying from lack of water. @CAPS1, his lack of water is futher shown through his episode at the old @ORGANIZATION1. At the factory, he finds a picture of a young boy drinking @ORGANIZATION2s Juice to which he find ironic. He said when he got back on his bike that. I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth helps take your mind of thirst by allowing spit to circulate. This illustrates his drastic need for water. Another feature that the cyclist approached was the heat. The high desert of California are known for being very, very hot areas. The cyclist believed that heatstroke would kill him and that he would be left out there because of twoold men. The heat is illustrated. When the cyclist says, ""Wide rings of isolated sweat circle my shirt."" @CAPS1, when he says, ""shows that the heat was blazing o him and showing him down. This is similar to an episode of someone lost in the desert. The same conflicts would be encounter and the same thought would be going their heads."
2,"The text supports the fact that the cyclsit was riding through a setting which effected him for the worsen. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California. I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening"" The author starts out by telling us were the cyclsit is (Lodi, California). We can assume that, since the cyclsit is in California, it is going to be fairly hot. ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclsit is now worried about his water consumption since he is in a California desert in June, which is a very hot time of the year to be biking in the desert so the cyclsit is now hot and runnig out of water which will soon lead to dehydration. ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June"" We now know that the conditions of the setting are bad enough that the cyclsit is already suferring from dehydration and is now fearing heatstroke. ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" The author now paints the setting as being a hoplessly empty desset with no form of hep. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die"" The cyclsit was now facing dehyration, possible heatstroke, and the hopless fealings of near death. The cyclist was put in a setting which effected him in one of the worst ways possible."
2,"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welchs Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, with all my strength. @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because it had the flavor of battery acid. Next, the Welchs Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle. He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."
2,"The abandoned setting, hot temperatures, and changing terrain took an emotional + physical toll on the cyclist. The abandoned setting frustrated the cyclist. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lowest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. The sight of the abandoned shed troubled the cyclist because he knew that this meant that the was hardly anything around him. This was frustrating and made him worried because he needed regular hydration. Not only was the abandoned setting frustrating, but also worrying because the cyclist felt alone and knew there was no one around to help if he needed it. The hot temperatures do a physical affect on the cyclist. I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist sweated through his shirt realized that he could have a heart stroke. The high temperatures dehydrated the cyclist to a point where he felt hopeless, but still he pushed on. Finally, the changing terrain took an emotional and physical toll on the cyclist Not two miles into this next session of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills then it is to pedal on flat road, so it was a physical obstacle for the cyclist. Also it was depressing to him because he was going to aphina 55 mph zone. The combination of this physical and emotional obstacles affected the cyclist because it made him worried to push harder. Despite his dehydrated state, he tested his inner spirit."
2,"The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because he is trying to get to Yosemite but he is running out of water and in the middle of Lodi, California where their is no buildings the cyclist is having no hope that he will make it to his destination because he is sweating and thinking that he should have not took advice from old-timers who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office and was thinking to himself if he would ever make it to Yosemite and the other thing that was on his mind was the snake which he said way a diamondback had blocked half the pavement so he had to carefully go past the snake without getting any closer to the snake. And finally he found an older guy sitting in a chair who was older than the group he hed listened to in Lodi, he gave him the map and told him how to get to Yosemite. For example the old-timers that gave him advise gave him wrong advise in the first place. I conclude that this story is about a cyclist trying to make his way their, but then he finds an answer to his problems when he finds and older-guy sitting in a chair in the shad and asks him why are you in a hurry and he tells him that he needs to get to Yosemite and the older guy give him a good map and tells him now to get there and soon after he finally gets to were he wants to go."
2,The setting in the story was the high deserts of California in June. At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldnt make it he saw a sign that said Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage and I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean So this brought self doubting behavior. 
2,"In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1, the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest make. This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1. @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit is used as an important for character development.  "
2,"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the old timers were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed. He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon  Gary and wilbers fish camp best bet then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."
2,"It is crucial that in a story the characters, stting and plot flow smootly, and not leave questions within the readers mind. Every aspecut of a story has it's own job in converging a specific tame or mood. A cemetery @MONTH1 leave the reader feeling frightened and uneasy, while a beach @MONTH1 give a joyous tame. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie is a recollection of a cycling experience that would forever change hot life on attitude. After accepting travel advice from a collection of old timers who havent left the confines of the purches since Carter was in office, Kurmaskie realizes the directicy were outdated. He is led through the desert, desperately searching for water. As Kurmaskie detaills the scenery, the reader becomes anxious ramshackle sheds, several rusty pipes, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule ?? to be the only sort of human existant for miles to come. As he passes tumbleweeds and a ridiculous large snake a sense of curiosity sweeps after the reader mind. How did he make it? '@CAPS1 elegently detailed accant of the scenery, the reader would not have been able to fully comprehend the urgency of the situation. A sense of despair and fear drips from the almost dreadid recollection of this experience. Emotions speak for deeper depths and volumes than words could ever express. Instead of simply stating I saw tumbleweed the auther takes it upon himself to let an inner and deeper potrayed at this experience because expected through his scene desriptions."
2,"In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lames mule, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he cant make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says sometimes life can be so cruel as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesnt believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation should please all sadists reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling."
2,"In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, I arrived at the first Townthis place might have been a thriving little spot at one timebut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, short, rolling hills (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldnt have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclists journey in a negative way."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldnt get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake. They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted I eased past. When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclists journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, were your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."
2,"The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states with strong legs and a smile on my face. As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state."
2,"The setting that the cyclist confronted in the story, Do not exceed posted speed limit, affected him and his feelings in many different ways throughout the story. He, at the end realized that the world changes with time as the worlds setting does too. If he had realized this sooner he @MONTH1 have not followed the old mens advice and, rather would have went with his near, up to date maps. Another features the setting that affected the cyclist was that is was June in California and he was runningout of water. He would become very dehydrate during the time of year in this place even with water. The desert was hot already, but must have seemed unbearable in June. The only thing that was giving him hope and determination after going several miles without any water was the setting of Yosemite paste, with its cool waters and pine trees for sheet. The ghost towns with no water also filled him with despair because not one of the three setting had any waters. The must have filled him with despair, but also determines to get to the water of Yosemite, or for that  matter, anywhere with fresh, clean, cool water. Finally the last setting he came to with the water from the sink must have filled him with asignificant amount of relief and gratitude so that he was ready to loss the owner of the store. The setting here gave the cyclist determination, relief, and the realization to now trust himself and his map.     "
2,"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, Rough Road Ahead which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."
2,"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "
2,"In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, a bicyclist is given directions from a group of older men that puts him on the wrong track to his destination. Things began well enough, the author stated, but his day was soon to become quite arduous. The cyclist realized he was on a roundabout, deserted route and he was running out of water. Each town and structure the old men had described were now deserted. The author began with a sense of amusement at the old mens in accuracy, but soon became troubled, as each of these towns were completely deserted, and he had been ""hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly. These buildings became an embodiment of lost hope for the cyclist. Each one was empty and without any water. A sign, warning against high speeds, mocked the cyclist in his dehydrated state. The last structure an open fishing camp filled the author with relief, dispersing his fears of dehydration and sunstroke. The structures caused the cyclist to move from amusement to despair to relief as he traveled through the California deserts. I have never had the experience of being caught without water on a wilderness trek. I know how to use a map so I would not need directions. The cyclists two failures were that he was unconfident in his direction and he was unprepared for climate he was in. These two failures almost cost him his life, a situation I would never be caught in."
2,"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town. This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadnt seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."
2,"In the essay Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. At first the cyclist is confident. He feels the old men he has gotten his advice from are wise in their years. For he is going on a bike trip to Yosemite national park, and their advice, he thought, was about to cut many worthless hours out of that days trip. The first setting the cyclist comes too is a lonely old ghost town, which only beniftis that the old water fountin is still in service. This is houmourous to the cyclist. He now knows the old mens advice is not up to date. Then, to his dismay, he comes to an even more abandoned town, no working water pump. This troubles the cyclist. He is determined to reach his destination but he has a feeling in the back of his mind something will go wrong. Then he sees a snake not only making him scared and dehydration but naw he is afraid of what animals could potentially harm him once he is in his unconscious state after traveling more he sees an old abandoned grape juice factory. The picture and he frolicing child sipping the cool juice is somehow a taunt to his condition after pushing himself and using his knowlage of biking, he finds a bait shop and imideately enters. Even though he still hasnt made it he now uses his own advice stick to your map."
2,"In the essay Do not Exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie the feature in the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. In this passage the cyclist had gone on a bike trip on a hot day during June to @LOCATION1 in California. The cyclist decided to go on a shortcut given to them by older people so they didnt bring as much water because they thought there were going to be stops. Each time the cyclist arrived at a stop, though, all the towns were old and rundown with no water sources. This was very difficult on the cyclist, It didnt really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. The cyclist was so thirsty that they really thought they were going to die until they reached a rest stop, as I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and by some bait-any bait, even though I didn'y own a rod or reel"". The cyclist shows their anger throughout the entire passage to the older men because when they were younger the towns were probably not rundown and they probably had good water sources, but that was not the case. The cyclist had to struggle the steep hills, the heat, rundown buildings, and wildlife of California with out water. If the day was cooler maybe the author wouldn't of thought as badly to older people."
2,"The many features of the setting affect the cyclist in a variety of ways. At the first stop, the ghost town didnt concern him too much as the narrator says, I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. At the second stop, it is evident that the, man is concerned that he has come across another ghost town, because he says, This sight was troubling. The cyclist probably feels very disappointed and a bit angry when he pumps out a tar like substance from the rusty water pump, followed by brackish water feeling two hundred degrees. The unexpected, pungent battery acid flavor of the water most likely made him want to puke. As he rides through rough, rolling hills, he becomes very depressed when he realizes from a road sign that he could be going 55 mph in a car, instead of the measly 12 mph, he was traveling. When he saw tumbleweeds cross his path, he probably felt totally lost and when he spotted a huge snake, he probably felt scared that he might fall and get bitten easily, being so dehydrated. After he comes across the old grape juice factory, he feels tortured and and mad, and then is desperate enough to suck on a pebble in attempt to keep his saliva circulating. When he finally reaches the fish camp, he is overjoyed and ecstatic, and drinks deeply from the sink. He is finally rehydrated and relieved that he has found civilization, and, more importantly, water."
2,"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, there are many features about the setting which challenge the cyclist. The story is about a cyclist, trying to bike to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist, in a hurry to get there, takes the advice of same older men. The older men reccomend a shortcut and the cyclist follows their directions, which turns out to be a mistake. The first challenge that meets the cyclist is an obvious lack of any inhabited town, and so he has no place top rest or get water. As the cyclist continues onward, he finds what the older men had instructed for him to do wouldn't work, since their reccomendations were far outdated. There were no rest stops where the older men said their would be, so it took only the strongest sort of perserverence to keep pedaling. Not only was water an issue as he biked through the California desert, there was no smooth path for him to bike on. ""Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view."" The cyclist makes it clear that the bike ride rapidly taking away from his energy and hydration. He also faced on enomous rattl snake, and hard to overcome that by quick thinking. In conclusion, the setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie really hurt the cyclist biking skills. The only way he overcame it was with mind-power, perseverence, and a little bit of hope."
2,"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasnt prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the high deserts of colifornia in June I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to ease post it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was replaced by short, rolling hills which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"
2,"The features in the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit portray the struggles the man went through and what he had to overcome. Three main features of setting were it is June and hot, there are many hills to be riding on and there are no buildings to stop and get water.  In the essay, the author describes trials and tribulations he went through in order to escape grueling conditions. One feature of setting is he is biking to Yosemite National Park. The park is beautiful and he is determined to get there. However, he it biking in June when the weather is extremely hot and difficult to do anything. Another feature of setting is that the area in which he is biking is extremely hilly and this makes it even more difficult to get anywhere when it is hot. He is dehydrated and having to go up all of the hills makes him even weaker and more disable to get to his final destination. Lastly, he has no water and he can not find a place to get water because he doesnt know where he is. This causes him to read to keep his water for certain times, when he needs it most. When dehydration fully sets in his chances of survival lessen and everything he does is dangerous. The setting features used in this essay help to portray the extent of the conditions he is facing. The setting features greatlyaffect the cyclist and his well-being.  "
2,"The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers shortcut as he states that things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. But what he didnt know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first town which was a ghost town. He wasnt overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist enormously. From the beginning, the cyclist is battling the terrain. It in home that the first fourty miles he was energized and not tired, but shortly often following the codgers advice, the old men on the porch, he was heading into trouble. First, the cyclist encounters a lack of water. The text says, This sight was troubling, It had been hotting any water bottles metty regularly and, it was traveling through high deserts of California June. Therefore, the cyclist was California hasidty running on empty in scarching heat. Which is not very pleasant. Next, the cyclist encounters rugged terrain and an obstacle. The text says, The speed limit was 55 mph it was doing a water depleted 12 mph it noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.'' @CAPS1 after, he encountered what he believe to be a diamond back snake. Although, in the end, dehidrated and fueled only by determination to assuage his thirst he found a fish camp. From a rather modern bathroom (he) drank deeply from the sink. This remindes me of war. You go into war excited to serve your country and hopeful that you are going to triumph. Then, time passes painfully and determination is the only feeling running you on day after guiding day. Finally, the war ends and you are changed forever like the cyclist was, the cyclist would never ask an elderly person for directons again.      "
2,"In the story Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit, the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says The sun was beginning to beat down. This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. "
2,"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly, first he statrs off happy because hes going to Yosemite national park and hed gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs, Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welchs grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old mans there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the fork of sorts as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasnt. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."
2,"In the essay Rough Road Ahead : Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist tremendously. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the warm temperature. The temperature affects the cyclist because it causes him to need water more then he usually would if it were a cooler day out. the sun was beginning to beatdown (@NUM1). The temperature affects him so much as to be very cautious of his water supply, so he makes it last. The second features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the rolling hills. The rolling hills are a nuisance to him and also are a sign to him he is going the wrong way. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The hills affect the biker by causing him to be more tired and use more water, which he would not have to consume as much if the road were flatter and again the day cooler. The third feature affecting the biker, which started this whole mess of a journey were the old men, who gave him the short-cut directions. The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. (Kurmaskie, @NUM2) If this feature did not exist in the essay, then the biker would have followed his own map and gotten to Yosemite, without any problems. In conclusion, these three features affect the cyclist tremendously."
2,"Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how The sun was beginning to beat down expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their shortcut. Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldnt hold the lamest male. @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a battery-acid flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait. His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesnt even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."
2,"In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the resevoir compground hes feeling pretty good because hes just leaving the serenity of an early-summer evening and hes headed toward The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. Hes in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because hes anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the ghost town and the sun was beginning to beat down hes less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, hes still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once a thriving little spot. Next, when the cyclist comes to one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a tarlike substance so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. "
2,"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       "
2,"In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist, showing his waining faith in his situation. For example, about @NUM1 miles into his ride from the place where the old codgers give him advice he arrives at the first town like area. Because this town looks to him deserted, like a ghost town, it causes him to conclude that no one has lived there since the last world war. Consequently, he feels the men gave him bad directions and must continue on his journey. Furthermore, when he sees the sight that reads Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit he feels life is cruel because the limit is 55 mph, but he is only capable of going 12 mph with little water. Seeing the sign makes the cyclist loose faith. Finally, when he sees the abandoned Welchs Juice factory the cyclist hangs his head. He sees the irony in that now, of all times he runs across a juice factory in a desert, but there is not a drop of liquid to be found. The cyclist hanging his head shows how this ironic situation affects him negatively, causing him to lose faith. In summation, the setting features in the Essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit cause the cyclist to loose faith in surviving his situation of being lost in the desert en route to Yosemite National Park.   "
2,"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct. This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead, by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage. This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, To @CAPS2 a fire where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "
2,"In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affects the author in cycling trip to Yosemite National Park. I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June, reads paragraph @NUM1, and I had been hitting the water bottles pretty regularly. Throughout the piece, it is the cyclists lack of water that creates problems for him. The length of his ride (made longer try the, to quote the words, shortcut that was to slice away hours from my ride, given to him try some elderly men whose information was out of date) and the weather on a gorgeous day in June cause him to realize that he could drop from heatstroke. The author travels over @NUM2 miles during his trip, as the sun heat down and he tranverse desert roads frequently try tumbleweeds and huge snakes. Every building and town he passes is abandoned, and so he as nowhere to refill his rapidly draining water supply. He also has to take on @NUM3 small rolling hills as well as one long, crippling hill. The rough terrain and his speed, a water-depleting 12 mph, reads the text, cause him to become dehydrated and despairing. He is thirsty, sweaty, and tired. Finally, in the end of the story, he comes across a campground store, and is able to refill his water bottles and rest, recovering from his trips ill effects.   "
2,"The features of the setting in the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this mans journey he was confident in his abilities. I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "
2,"The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now behind him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclists physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclists physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."
2,"The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he cant find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find towns nearby. Once he finds them, they are either ghost towns or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way."
2,"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead, by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist has a very challenging journey to reach his destination of Yosemite. The setting features caused many problems for him to overcome. After about @NUM1 miles of biking, the cyclist reaches one ram shake shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold the lamest mule. He attempts to receive some water from a pump, but nothing other than tar like substance and b brackish water tasting of battery acid exits the pump. This causes a problem of dehydration. The cyclist has so much water with him and he is in a hot climate (the high deserts of California in June). He has no other source of water and he needs to keep hydrated. Then he reaches a highway sign that says, ROUGH @CAPS1 AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The posted speed was 55 mph and the cyclist was strainfully proceeding at 12 mph. His next hurdle to jump, was a large snake, he thought possibly to be a diamond back. It laid in his path so he had to use his strength to keep balance and make way around it. After he makes his way over a hill, he sees a building that he makes sure is not a mirage. Thankfully its not, but on thankfully its an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1 factory. So, the setting proved to be very difficult for him."
2,"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Also it says in the story I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."
2,"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first town that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist chuckled and moved on, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached the fork of sorts twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilbers fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old mens directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."
2,"In the stories, dont exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "
2,"The unrelenting heat, the lack of water and the absence of any sign of civilization along his try left the cyclist in a precarious situation that @MONTH1 have resulted in his death. It was an extremly hot day, and the cyclist was sweating continously. The heat began to make him feel sick and dehydrated as he continued in the trip. Also, the lack of water turned the situation to dangerous for the cyclist. He could not find a healthy water source, so he began to fear for his life. He knew that if he did not reach a town that was inhabited and had water  soon, he was going to be in trouble. Along the road he was riding, there were no streams or rivers to be found; it was purely desert. The lack of civilization along the road scared the cyclist and made the trip very eeric for him. He felt helplessly alone and knew that it anything were to happen to him none would know until too late. The setting made the cyclist overheated, thirsty, and desperately alone. As he went from deserted town to deserted town he became more and more worried. His only hope was a water pump located at one of the short towns, but that was only filled with brackish water that was undrinkable. These features would cause dishness and scare anyone in the same situation    "
2,"The setting of the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a short cut"" from so he do me through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face. With this he arrives at the first town but hes wasnt worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit. This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions."
2,"The features of the setting, in the California deserts affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was happy and confident when he first started out. Things began well enough, I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile into my face. The cyclist was calm and confident in the beginning, barely noticing the sun heating down, Then the settings changes as the cyclist moves on. Not two miles into this next sectionI noticed the terrain changing. The road was replaced by short rolling hills. The cyclist was tired and thirsty.  I toiled on, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. He though about the bad things that could happened to him. I could drop from heart stroke. Then the cyclist glimsped a building. He was motivated a\t the thought of civilization, and retrieving his thirst,  a building came into view with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I maneuvered down the hill. The different setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was tired and thirsty when the sun beat down on him and also motivated when he saw a sign of civilization. Many people are affected by different setting like the cyclist was. People could feel happy on a beautiful sunny day sad on a gloomy and rainy day. Different settings have different affects on people."
2,"The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
2,"The features in the setting affect the cyclist greatly throughout his journey. He gets advice from two old timers and really is unsure about what will happen. All thats in his mind is getting to Yosemite, so the shortest way is the best way to him. When he leaves early in the morning, he comes to the first so call town where there is absolutely nothing. As the day proceeds conditions become harder as he says: The sun was beginning to beat down This setting affected the cyclist because the hotter it got for him the harder it was going to be for him to continue. Biking in the hot weather makes people more tired and sometimes even light-headed. Another setting that affected the cyclist was when he began to run out of water. Already being in the hot sun, there was no way to keep himself hydrated. When he says: I get down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.'' His water bottle was already finished and how he had no luck with the water pump. As the day went on the cyclist was without water and in the hot sun. He was affected greatly by dehydration, one a weak body from the heat. Lastly, the biker used other techniques to help his thirst when he: ''gathered up a"

Than he members it to ""Gary and wilbers  Fish comp and gets a drink of water and tells them be survived because of a very good map."
2,"The features of the setting in, Rough Road Ahead negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable. When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid. @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people  crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement. As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, Rough Road Ahead."
2,"While the biker is last the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist took a shortcut that got him lost and almost lose all his water. He learned to not trust advice from old-timers, but was saved so by finding by Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp.-owned by an old guy. During the cyclistss ride he saw a sign that said. ""Rough road ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit."" the cyclist was only going @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM2. Not having any water made him not go as fast, so the sign seemed to made him. Just as things were bad enough, it seemed that the sign was laughing at him. Then Joe kurmaskie writes, At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority at the pavement in front of me. The tumbleweed showed how how the short cutt was obviously not a short cutt and was taking a very long time. Tumbleweeds represent rolling through and through without a purpose, and that was exactly what the cyclist was doing.  The snake showed him how much danger he was in. He was lost and only had a few drops of water; he could die. The snake represents death and wicked by scaring people of being bit and dying. Seeing the snake raise the cyclists alarm and realization that he could die."
2,"The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. The cyclists expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. .I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasnt many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasnt enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negativly affected the cyclist expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey"
2,"From reading the story, l believe the setting of the desert he was cycling affected him immensly. I believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and hydrated. As time and miles went on the scenery mover changed.That can be really hard. in heated water or, you need to be as hydrated ad possible, especially it an enduring in physical activity. When time he went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing in think about a long other them, how much larger, how thirsty he was  and is this worth it?

2,"In the essay, Rough Road Ahead a cyclist takes advice from a bunch of codgers who in attempt to tell him of a shortcut, almost cause his downfall. As a result this cyclist is stuck in the high deserts of California, whose features greatly affect his trip. One feature of the setting is that it is desserted. After the first forty miles, the cyclist describes the first town he was supposed to hit as a ghost town. Then after another twenty miles he finds one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral At this point the cyclist is low on water and tries the pumps. Because the towns have been empty for many years, the water in the pumps has the flavor of battery acid. Since no people were there to fix the water, the cyclist couldnt get clean water, and began to suffer dehydration. Another feature of the setting is the heat. The cyclist had been hitting his water bottles pretty regularly, and the heat only added to his need for water. This need combined with the lack of water available caused the cyclist to begin dehydrating. This California setting affected the cyclist because it was a desert in two ways. Its surplus of heat combined with the lack of people helped to dehydrate the cyclist. For him, water was necessary, but unavailable.   "
2,"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says with any luck Id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he drank deeply from the sink. The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."
2,"The setting of the story really affected the rider. It was a humid day with only a few bottles of water. The sign says caution Rough road ahead. It is flat terrain turned into small hills. Exhausted and dehydrated he pushed himself as far as he could go, up and down hills. Finally sight and old building. He had as into the bathroom and splashed cold water onto his face. When walking out with a dripping wet face, an old man in the chair asked him if he had direction. He said I have a very good map. He just stood there and listened to the old timer speak. He then he had been off the pord, in so long. The biker would not of used his directions anyway. It took @NUM1 miles just to get to the first town. Back a little ways in the sign said do not exceed the speed limit, which was @NUM2. The rider was only going at his tired and exhausted @NUM3. I think that if he didnt get to the old building he wouldnt have made it the entire way. Riding along the riders mood I thought was confidence followed by determination and relief. To ride in conditions like that you need to be able to push yourself as far as possible to get where you want to go."
2,"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening. This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, denyoyed One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically."

In the story it states that the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This helps to make the point that it is very hot outside. Since the cyclist is biking in a setting that reaches high temperatures, the cyclisst ios affected physically because he often needs to drink water in order to keep himself hydrated. Also, in the story the cyclis bikes through an area of run-down towns. Since the towns are run-down, the cyclsit cant refill his water bottle. This setting aspect affects his physical state because he is running out of water and is becoming exceedingly thirsty. It affects his mental state because he starts thinking that he was not going to be able to make it. For example he states, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.. @CAPS1 as in this story, setting can cery greatly affect everyones physical and mental state during everyday life. For example, if it its raining outside people often feel cold and they @MONTH1 start feeling tired or gloomy. As one can see, however, the features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist because of his lack of water."

One of the first settings he came upon was, the traditional definition of a ghost town. (pg @NUM1) The emptiness and deserted look of the town made the biker laugh that the men thought it was still active, at this point, the cyclist was amused by the sight, not disturbed at the lack of people in the town. As he ventured on the cyclist came upon another empty town, one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me, this sight was troubling. (pg @NUM1) This ghost town scared the cyclist. Since he realized there wasnt any amusing town else by and the waterpump didnt work, it instead released murky water tasting of battery acid, the biker was scared, but determined to find water and to continue his journey. The terrain turned from flat road to short, rolling hills. The cyclist became dizzy, hallucinating, and thought he was going to die when more untrusty terrain swept by. Finally, he found a stop with, a rather modern bathroom. (pg @NUM1) and found water and relief. He wasnt going to die, or get eaten by birds. The cyclists journey through different towns and terrains, changed his mood, and hope of survival."
2,"The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit has a great effect on the main character in the story.

Then, he continues moving on the road. Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isnt what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said over the long crippling hill, a building came into view. It is at this point that he uses the word crippling because he is just about exhausted and cant go any further."

As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of the serenity of an early summer evening, and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the town he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved.

He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This setting is a major setback to the cyclists journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through.

The settings of the essay affect him on his travels through the California desert by giving him will power as well as by deteriorating his strength."
2,"The setting in  the story affect the cyclist greatly by making him dehydrated, tired, and by being in general dangerous. As the author sets out, he has plenty of water and is ready to take on the road ahead. But as the day grew hotter, he began to run out of the water. ""The growing realization that I could drop from a heatstoke a gorgeous day in June the author told of his worry. The June day in California was hot and dehydrating and he had to be careful. Not only the heat, but the actual landscape affected him too. He had started the day out with strong legs and a smile on his face, But as time were on the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. Hills are very hard on cyclists and these ones would make anyone tired. The author would have to endure this path on top of the thirst he was feeling. He also had to watch out for the desert creatures and other such problems. At one path a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamond black blocked the pavement in front of me. told the author. He very well could have been bitten by that snake, and then he would have been dead. Therefore, the setting affects heat stoke very dangerous."
2,"During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasnt even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach rough roads creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesnt have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesnt have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didnt conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didnt get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesnt really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they dont help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit. In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.  When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage and that not to get too excited the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to burning sun and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states with only luck Id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting."
2,"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldnt hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling. Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel. ""@CAPS1 him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"". Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @CAPS1 his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @CAPS1 his journey seen to be harder and filled with ?? hope as strenght left to finish his goals."
2,"In the essay Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first town he is not too worried about it and moves on. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state. @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didnt seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the authors moods."
2,"In the case of thr cyclist in the story, Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit, the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. @CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, ghost town infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didnt know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne."
2,"The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as the high deserts of California. The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist."
2,"In the essay,Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie,there are several features of the setting that affect the cyclist.The first is the heat,which was so strong when he was cycling that he became dehydrated,I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,This was the element that most affected the narrator,because the heat caused his water deprivation which followed him throughout the essay.Another feature in the setting that affected the cyclist were the old men who gave the narrator the directions which led to his troubles in the first place.Like a foolish youth,the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a shortcut If the men hadnt given him the unneeded and false information,he would have been able to make it to @LOCATION1 without all the troubles.The last element from the setting that affected him were the towns and how spread out they were from one another.The old guys had swan the next town was only eighteen miles down the road.If the towns had been closer together,the narrator couldve gotten a drink faster and not have been as tortured by thirst as he was throughout the essay.The three elements had a major decision in the essay as well."
2,"I believe three features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. The horizon, the hills, and the empty ghost ""towns"" all helped him along his journey. He was riding perfectly confident on his way to Yosemite National Park when he was supposed to reach his first town, when actually all he found the traditional definition of a ghost town. It was deserted and broken down. He couldnt refuel his water or anything. You might think this hurt him, but actually it just gave him encouragement to make it to the next town. He was now determined to make it to the next town and fill up his water. Just like the ghost town the horizon and the hills helped him on his way and gave him hope to get to where he wanted to be. Each time he saw a hill he would tell himself that if he just made it up this one, he would find something usefull. He kept doing that on every hill and it helped him stay focused and continue on biking. The horizon did a similar thing. He would point to places on the horizon and tell himself that once he got there he would be fine. And again it kept him determined and made him keep biking and not give up."
2,"The setting in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit really has a effect on the cyclist. It takes place in the middle of nowhere with no water and wild animals. There was no one in sight. Not a building, car, or a structure of any kind. Since the cyclist could not see any sign of civilization, he started to feel uneasy. Having the feeling of being lost or alone can cause anyone to panic, so many thoughts go through your head at that time, such as never getting home. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Not being in a place where water was easily contained he began panic. Without the water he was positive that he would die. Everyone knows that it is possible to die of thirst so when the possibility of it happening to you appears its all you can think of. I was going to die an the birds would pick me clean. Since this place he was in had wild animals the thought that they could harm him entered his mind. You can see movies and t.v how this happens so being in that place with the animals it was obvious that would come to mind. Without setting the cyclist would have had very different emotions. "
2,"The cyclist in Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit starts off in the serenity of an easly summer evening taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didnt mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his short cut was not so short after all. The high deserts of California in June and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the hed be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a Welchs Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  "
2,"Throughout the essay, the cyclist finds himself coming across many issues with his settings that are imitating, however, he pressures himself through will fallen to continue with his journey. First the cyclist comes across rusteel water pump, Hes in an old abandoned warn down down the a the water like substance emitted from the pump is not drinkable, despite his extreme thirst. This propels him to continue onward b/c he must be hoping for the best in the towns to come. Unfortunately, his travels dont continue what struggle.Feat roads was replaced by short rolling hills. Despite how life can feel so cruel, the cyclist continues on. He doesnt give up and walks through this obstacle. Finally, just when a building in sight gives him hope, the cyclist is disappointed to discover it was abandoned. Not only that, but it had been a @ORGANIZATION1. He sees this as an ganic thirst that is to upsetting, its almost rather humerous. From that reaction, the reader can determine he is setting the apparent discomfort, and instead remaining remarkably persistant in the efforts to reach his goal. This effort shows a person that to the cyclist, are instation at such issues in his current setting, arent as powerful at his will, pressuring him onwards up his journey as a determined cyclist."
2,"The features of the setting in the storygreatly affect the cyclist. Although his problem is lack of water, this wouldnt have been such a problem in different, less The features of the setting dry, setting. Also, the landscape is discouraging, even though the cyclist always determined. For example, the first place he comes to is a ghost town, although he says he chuckled and moved on, he would have felt differently if there had been people outside to speak with. The next place he stops, a ramshackle shed, is discouraging because it is almost like it is feasting him with its undrinkable water. At this point his spirits lower and he starts to question the old mens advice. The tumble weeds and snake that he sees later add to his frustration and worry that he might not make it because they are the stereotypical symbol of a lonely, dry place thats impossible to survive in. He again has his hopes lifted and then cruelly dropped when the abandoned Welchs Grape Juice factory arms into sight with its fearing billboard. He now has more thoughts about dying out there. He is also affected physically because the hills are tiring. The features of the setting  are extremely discouraging, and a person weather in spirit wouldnt have made it through."
2,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The town that fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. He thought would be the only one. So he kept riding on without worry. When he came to the next place, a ramshackle shed several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldnt hold the lamest mule, the cyclist started to worry. If the setting had still just been the deserted road, he wouldnt have had that much reason to worry. Then the terrain changed from flat road to short, rolling hills, with a sign saying. rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. This change in setting caused more uncertainty and despair for the cyclist. when he saw what had been a Welchs Grape Juice factory, the despair finally settled in. It was too ironic for the cyclist, because he was in need of water. Finally, he reached a bait shop, and hope returned as easily as rounding a bend and his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him. On top of all of this, being in the high deserts of California in June, helped to create the places effects on the cyclist. If it had been a cooler day, in a cooler place, none of these settings would have had any effect."
2,"The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town. This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist."
2,"'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself."
2,"It is obvious that the features of the setting will very easily affect someone. In the passage Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In paragraph one, the speaker is describing how there were old men sitting on their porches which should have told him they werent the most updated people ever. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. This quote is showing how the setting of old men on porches affects the speaker to doubt the directions of the men. On his bike ride, the cyclist approaches a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. In this quote, the cyclist is troubled by the old features of this setting and it worries him because it appears no one has been to this spot in ages. This makes the cyclist very doubtful that he is where he is supposed to be. Overall, the cyclist is easily affected by the features of the settings around him and bases his attitude of his journey on them. These are just a few examples of places in the passage where the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
2,"Many things affected the cyclist in this story. The heat rlack of water, hills, and wild life all affected him. The heat caused the cyclist to become right headed. and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. He was so hot the cyclist was afraid of heatstroke. to make sure it wasnt a mirage. The heat also affected his visibility and thinking. Whe he first saw the factory he was worried that it was a mirage and seing things. Also the lack of water made him dehydrated. It made his body hard to function ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The lack of water made it very hard for him to ride his bike. That smoky blue tune rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain. The heat and lack of water made it hard for him to think straight. The deserted desert did not impare the situation. He was lost and there was no one to help him in the barren wasteland. If there had been people around he could have asked for help. In the end the setting did not break him and he found a filth bait shop. The featured of the setting did not help , but hindered the cyclists journey."
2,"The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonists problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June,  and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because  The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. "
2,"In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isnt described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isnt in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in."
2,"The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. Id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you."
2,"The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date. Then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the olds mens short cut through the desert with one meschy bottle of water. It was really hot out side and the sun was scorging down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he ??? and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water. This made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride. The settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he would have took the route that was on the map then he would have know where he was and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in the moth to reserve water or thoughts of finding water he would "
2,"In the story Rough Road Ahead, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, @CAPS1 had to ride through hills, dirt paths, rocky roads, and cross snakes, in order to get to her destination. @CAPS1 even rode through some of the highest deserts in California in June. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills. @CAPS1 was in a bumby situation.  @CAPS1 even came across an old building of some sort, one that used to make @ORGANIZATION1- the building hadnt been used in so many years. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. The cyclist is affected by the lack of water. @CAPS1 rode for about @NUM1 miles total with a water and then sucked on stones to help take her mind of the thirst. The features only affected her a little. @CAPS1 only had to pedel long distances and across uneven roads. Due to this, @CAPS1 got real thirsty and eventually got real mad at the old people, but at the same time @CAPS1 felt sorry for herself and laughed a sad, hopeless laugh. "
2,"The setting of this story creates a large obstacle for the cyclist .On his journey to Yosemite he becomes dehydrated and feels like giving up .He has to overcome the windy roads much like the snake , the desert setting , and being alone .While on his journey he crosses the path of large snake .Much like windy roads in the picture he has to get past the snake .He states dianwnaback  blocked the majority of the pavement  infront of me  This is just like another thing he wont let stop him because hes determined .The desert must be harsh and I it can seem as if it goes on forever .Surely you would think being dehydrated he would turn around but then lies another journey .I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June  obviously in June its going to be hot which also takes its roll .Being  alone during this struggle can make one feel like they have no support .In the picture its just him, the ,road , and the dirt. With miles of this to go he cant just stop you have to in a sense go forward to go back .So in conclusion the cyclist cant do anything to help himself other than keep pedaling."
2,"The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didnt because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. It didnt really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadnt been running out of water I dont think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse."
2,"In the story, Do not exceed postal speed limit, many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who havent left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office. This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. That smoky blues tune Summer time rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain. This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park."
3,"The author of Winter Hibiscus included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""Its-its not a real one, Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto. The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now. Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."
3,"The author decides to end the story Winter Hibiscus this way to emphasize her main theme, and connect the events and emotions in a sentence so the reader can better relate to her story. The author establishes an ending that summarizes her story and connects it all, however, she still leaves it open for the reader to wonder what might happen and also to connect this to his or her own life. The tone that the author creates by this last sentence is of @CAPS1 and a way of adjusting to a new life. Throughout the story, the girl Saeng has been defined by nostalgia, her longing for the past. This is especially shown when the flowers she had once seen in Vietnam were in the florist shop: Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral"". She remembered finding the petals of this plant in her well. When describing Saengs nostalgia, the author had used imagery words to draw the reader in and almost becore Saeng. The end ties in this imagry of the hibiscus, only this five, it is a hibiscus blooming in a region where it struggles to grow as well as in Vietnam:  Its flowers arent as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This is a symbol of Saeng adjusting to her new life. At the end, the images of the hibiscus blooming, and the geese returning after finding a way to adjust, make a deep meaning to what the author has built up: @CAPS1 for adjustment. Finally, the author puts ...then I will take the test again; meaning that Saeng will be ready and will adjust like the hibiscus and geese. Therefore, the author uses it to previous imagry together to emphasize her theme ad get reader to think about the situation in a deep way.    "
3,"Depending on a person they have many strengths and weakness. There are many people out there that will quickly give up after not succeeding the first time. While others will put up a fight and go at it again until they get it. It all depends on the person and if they are strong and willing or weak and not willing. In this case Saeng is a strong and willing person. Thats why. I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraphSaeng is already a strong person she just have some weaknesses because of her new life. Theres still some things that is very sensitive to her, like after she fails her driving test, during her walk home she notices a flower known as a Hibiscus that reminded her so much of home and her grandmother, what shows that is the the story it says ""That, at  least, she could hold onto. But where was the fire-toothed comb? The bibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung the Saengs eyes how swept over."" show how this hurts still thinking about her life in Vietnam.   Still after all this she expresses her feelings to her mom so she can feel better and in the end comes to her  strong self and feeling that she will get through all of her hard times. Since she's not a quiter and will go for what she deserves and wants. I know she's serious because she kept her plan to succeeding to herself and did not announce, so she about it, not about her words. Saeng is a strong person who will go far and make many achievements and will get through her tough times because of the person she is. That's why the author an divided @CAPS1 statement at the end of the story."
3,"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10536	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saengs attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her drivers test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying """"...then I will take the test again. Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."""

3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to emphasize the impact that the hibiscus plant has on Saeng. For example, in the text, the author writes, 'What happened?' she asked, more gently. I-I failed the test.  The quote emphasizes one of the conflicts in the story. Saeng has just failed a test and is afraid of her mothers reaction. The test is what has her upset throughout the story. However, in the last paragraph, Saeng looks at the flower and realizes that she can rely on it to comfort her. This is why she says that when the hibiscus is budding, she can take the test. It can give her something to comfort her and prepare her for the test. Also, the other conflict in the story is the fact that Saeng misses her mother and her homeland. In the story, the author writes, But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? Saeng misses her old country and her grandmother. Because she misses these two precious items, she spends the extra money to buy the hibiscus plant. So she can look at the plant and have those fond memories of fixing the grandmothers hair. Possibly, she could have been thinking of these grievances while taking the test. By having that hibiscus plant bud in the end, the author is showing how Saeng knows that everything is going to be okay. All good stories must end with a conflict resolution. By ending the story with the chosen paragraph, the author is solving the conflict of the test and the memories. When the plant buds, Saeng will always have it to comfort her and provide her with those fond memories. The hibiscus plant provides the resolution to the two main conflicts of Winter Hibiscus.    "
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ... the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her. The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. @CAPS1, Saeng said. After failing her drivers test, walking into the florists shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.  "
3,"In the short story Winter Hibiscus, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test when the snow melts and the geese return. I believe that the Hibiscus and the drivers test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The authors intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her drivers test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
3,"In @CAPS1 Hibiscus by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again. She cant say home because home isnt hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotions all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"

Then when she is older she will prob. go back and see every thing that she misses."
3,"The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story Winter Hibiscus on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. Theyve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags which is the mothers attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again. She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is bad, but she doesnt  give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test, is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @CAPS1  could easily give up on their driving test, but she wont. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saengs dwoton  the her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. The conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. As a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story. This conclusion show how Saeng is adapting to changes info and hope to enjoy her  new life in @LOCATION1."
3,"Saeng is a young girl and has a lot of things on her mind other than this so called test"". She is determined to accomplish her goals and feels down when they are not compleleted. She lives in a life of poverby from what it sounds like and her mother is very supportive. It sounds like an ok life and a great family. The hibiscus in the story enabled Saeng to channel her sorrow for failing the test. The plant reminds her of her homeland in Vietnam reason here; And that rich, sweet scent-that was familiar too. This shows how when she is in the flower shop she is being reminded of her home land. But I bealive that the author concludes the story with this because Saeng is wishing that she could pass the test and it is not only giving us hopes but it gives her hope also. This is making up for the times that she felt down,  And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. She is so sad and when she is seeing the plants of her home land it makes. her even more sad. The author used geese at the end to force Saeng to have to use that time to retake the test. Next time that year at spring Saeng will go retake the test. The author was very thoughtful when she used this quote. She placed it as a hope and marker in Saengs life. It gave the reader and character hope and sealed the end of the writing.  "
3,"'When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. the author includes this quote toward the end of the paragraph at the end of the story to reveal the true importance of the moral in the story.Saeng @MONTH1 have failed her test, but she knew she could take it again. Her mother possesses a very hardworking quality to her and she has passed that on to her daughter Saeng. It is clear that in the story the two of them work together to be better or to do better things in more effective ways. For example, the quote basically summarized the story and its meaning. Look how root-bound it is, poor thing. Lets plant it, right now. This quote explains the mother wanted to do it right. Saeng felt that to take the test over when the flowers bloom again in the spring when the geese return home, as if thats when the things are better, she should take the test. In her reasoning of the quote at the end of the story give one the ability to believe that she wants to take the test over when things are better in nature, as if that @MONTH1 help her too. Therefore, maybe Saeng will do better on the test @CAPS1 that nature is comfortable and at home in warm, fresh, new weather. Also Saeng feels as if she could do better under the comfort of her homeland."
3,"The author of the story Winter Hibiscus most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs. Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saengs despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, then I will take that test again.you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that everything connects together Saeng first gets the hibiscus after failing her drivers test. T is becoming winter so when the plant blooms again it will belike hope and things that she is used to are restored, making it so she will have the confidence to take the test again. She realizes near the end that even the geese have become familiar to her, so when all the familiar things return like the hibiscus and the geese, she will be able to take the drivers test again which is unfamiliar to her. During the story, she is sadden by memories of familiar plants, she starts to realize that her new country is not as strange anymore and even the things that she found strange in the beginning are gaining some familiarity. She has to adapt tochanges that can be extremely hard for anyone and the things that she finds familiar to her are helping her through it. The last paragraph has a lot of feeling as it is when Saeng seems to be filled with hope and determination which is different from the sadness and longing of the rest of the story. This is the authors version of a happy ending, where the mood changes from sad to determined and hopeful as Saeng realizes things really arent that bad. Many authors use happy endings after sad story because it indures a feeling of hope in the reader at the end which makes the story plesant to read"
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture thats when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she cant grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now. Saeng didnt want to expect the move but noticeing that she wont forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saengs feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."
3,"There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year. "
3,"Having to move to a new home is very hard. Especially in the character @CAPS1 point of view. Saeng is oriental and had just move from her country to the United States. In the given story, Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS2 Ho, Saeng says, when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it represents her love, strength and growth that she has and will be going through. The winter hibiscus represents her love because her love for having a closer bond with her mother will become greater and greater the more they have each other. For example, Saeng says, There was afrail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. This shows how she is mad that they are there, but she is glad that she has her mother her strength is going to advance on as she stays longer and longer in @LOCATION2 as her new home. For example, in the text it states that, ...she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had becomealmost familiar now. As to the hibiscus, overall she will go through many rough times, but she will also blossom and become and stronger person. They have that paragraph at the end to show that this isn`t the end, but a new beginning to her life.  "
3,"The author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower Madagascar penwinhle she thinks how strange to see it in a pot because Back home it just grows wild, The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says and the geese return, because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says I will take that test again. This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her drivers test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she Dug out a hole and knows its strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saengs character.  "
3,"The author concludes the passage with this sentence because it illustrates very clearly the theme of the passage that a little bit of comfort from fond memories can help you to see the light in a not so comfortable situation. Saengs story illustrates this theme because she was feeling lost and out of place since moving to @LOCATION1, especially after she had just failed her driving test. She sincerely missed her homeland and sadly recounted her memories from back home as she expresses that A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengs eyes now swept over her and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. This section of the passage illustrates how deeply Saeng misses her homeland. It is this winter hibiscus that she finds into a florist shop that brings back these fond memories, yet also evokes such sadness. As the plants the hibiscus in her familys garden with her mothers encouragement, Saeng begins to feel better as her mother begins to make one of Saengs favorite meals, an omelet with slices of the bitter melon that Saeng much preferred to a Big Mac. This comparison exemplifies how Saeng still prefers the objects of her home, but has come to accept the new things of @LOCATION1. Because of this hibiscus and all of the fond memories that evoked in her, Saeng decided to take the test again when the hibiscus was ready again, perfectly illustrating how something of a fond memories can make someone overcome and adapt."
3,"The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesnt yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. Im glad you got it, Saengs mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saengs hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country."
3,"The author ends the story with the narrators though when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. to emphasize the theme of the passage . To be specific, the authors theme was survival and adapting to new surrounding, by ending with the narrator vowing to try again in the spring It shows the narrators will to survive in a new area/home. The author @MONTH1 have also ended this way for symbolic purposes. Forexample, having the girl promise to try the test again when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is bidding  has the hibiscus symbolizing not only the literal sense of beauty but the idea of cormfort, strength, determination and survival. The author also has the change of season from winter to spring symbolizing not just the change of time but also as symbolic for the authors ability to adapt to her new surrounding/home because her family has moved to the @CAPS1 from Vietnam and she is missing home very much. Fastly, the author could have ended the story like this to create a final mood, @ORGANIZATION1, when one reads the final sentence they get the feeling of determination, power, strength, drive etc. therefore the after effect or feelings they have are strong and fresh causing it easier for the reader to understand the theme and symbolism in the story Winter Hibiscus"
3,"The last paragraph of the story, Winter Hibiscus, leaves the reader wondering what will happen later in Saengs life and inspires hope in her story. The last paragraph of the story reads, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story with that paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng has not given up on her new life, she just needs a little more time to adjust until she becomes more comfortable. For example, Saeng has not grown accustomed to eating @CAPS1 foods. When her mom is preparing an omelet with slices of bitter melon, she realizes no @CAPS1 would like this meal. But she admits to herself, she, much preferred to a Big Mac. This tells the readers Saeng is not comfortable with her new life. The authors last paragraph hints the reader that by next spring, Saeng will have adjusted. Another reason the author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph is to let us know she is not giving up on her goal. Even though she failed her drivers test, she will try again. The last paragraph @MONTH1 also relate Saeng to the hibiscus plant. When the plant buds next spring is when she will retake the test. Maybe Saeng will also bud and become accustomed to @CAPS1 life. The last paragraph of the story successfully concludes Saengs journey"
3,"The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance.

3,"The author ends the story by @CAPS1 when they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again. Saeng had just failed her drivers test and on the way home bought a hibiscus. She took it home and showed her mother and planted it. The story ends with Saeng @CAPS1 she will take the test again when the hibiscus blooms to show the new beginning the hibiscus symbolizes. The story quotes, and when the sun had dries it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok malik bud into it.

The hibiscus is a sense of new beginning for Saeng with support from the past. The plant gives hope to Saeng and courage since it reminds her of her mother country. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with @CAPS1 saeng will take the test when the hibiscus blooms to show the new courage saeng finds in her new country with memories of her past such as plants like the hibiscus. The hibiscus blooming will be the sign of a new beginning for saeng with support and memory from her past."
3,"The author concludes the story with that quote because. It closes he sad emotions and out of place feeling. But yet opening a story of her starting a new life in a new place and how the plants especially the Hibiscus contributed to that. For example The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair. As you can tell from that small quote. You can see that the smell of the flower brings her back into the past where she felt warm, comfortable, and the times she spent with her grandmother in a familiar place she reconizes. Another example would be, Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand new, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. In the quote Saeng holds on tight to try to feel something that will remind her of home. She tries to seek same sort of motivation deep  within her she can embrace to learn to go on in @LOCATION1 making it a little like home something  she can relate and that is what the flower gives her and @LOCATION1 a rezemlence of Vietnam. And that is why the author concludes the story with the quote. when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."
3,"The author includes this last paragraph in the story, Winter Hibiscus to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengs eyes now swept over her. Saengs mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    "
3,"In Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the authors purpose in concluding the story with When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again, was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world. This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
3,"When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you dont have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country."
3,"Saeng promises herself that  In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan. The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now. She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable."
3,"The author of Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho, concludes the story with this to show the importance of the comfort Saeng finds in things that are familiar to her. Taking a test under pressure when you have other things on your mind that are stressing is not a good feeling. Saeng still hard not coped with the fact that she had moved from her home and was very stressed, this is probably why she had failed. In the spring, when the snow melts it is warm like back home. When the geese return, it will be comforting as they have now become familiar to her. Then she says when this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test, because the hibiscus is comforting and familiar as well. When all of the stress is gone it will be easier for her to take her test and pass. Comfort is important to all people in a stressful situation. By ending the story on this note it shows Saengs strength like the hibiscus in winter. Her mother says, Ive seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng @MONTH1 be out of place in her current location but she has the determination to survive in a place out of her comfort. Next time she takes the test she will have the strength to succeed."
3,"The concluding paragraph of the story ""winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho shows an urge for change and hope in which the maincharacter thrives for. In the concluding paragraph she swears to ""take the test again."" or go to the green house again and look back into her past It is not that she doesn't wan't to remember, She wants to accept that it is done and she needs to move on. Within the green house the simple sight of dok Malik (Jasmine) is enough to excite memories of her grandmother and the past things she needs to accept are over. ""A wave of loss so deep that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her. A Blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrrevocably gone. reads paragraph in. She replayed it all in vein, she saw it but there was. no way to rech the experence wich is what she wanted. there fore she broke down. the point of ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake that test again."" is to show that she thrives to accept what she cannot change. It also portrays the theme in a way. The theme is that the past lives on and offects us today, she realizes This however she wants to break it."
3,"The author uses a touching ending to her story that snows the strength that saeng has to overcome her obstacles. It tells raeders  that as nature and hibiscus plantshe planted start to get stronger again ,she will to . The authors reason for ending her story with a deep thought might inspire others to overcome challenges ,just like saeng plans to. She wants to send the message of being strong out to readers .she uses the symbolism of the hibiscus to try to go deeper. When the author writes,hibiscus is budding  she is also talking about the memories  saeng has and how she will be able to overcome them and become strong at the same time that the hibiscus becomes strong . The memories of Vietnam lie in the plant and she knows that it will be hard to accept and adapt to her new surroundings, but as the plant does, she will be able to do so to. The other reason for ending the story like this @MONTH1 be to connect the story with the beginning. As  the hibiscus comes into play, the test is forgotten .However , wrapping up with this paragraph allows readers to remember her failing the  test and see the strength she will have to retake it .Altogether , this ending reaches deep into the readers hearts and @MONTH1 in the end inspire them to have the strength to overcome obstacles just like saeng "
3,"The author concludes this story, Winter Hibiscus, with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her drivers test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   "
3,The author finished the story with that paragraph because it symbolizes that Saeng needs time to prepare to take the test again just like the hibiscus needs time to prepare to bud. This symbolism in this is that the hibiscus itself is a symbol to overcome obstacles as to keep on living and surviving at thee in the world no matter what happens. So this symbolism is present when night after Saeng failed the drivers test she went right to the flower store and bought that hibiscus because that flower grows at home and it reminded her of home in Vietnam so in a way they were both at a place from Vietnam. The plant isnt in its normal habitat and Saeng isnt in her birth place or even country.  Another way on how the author might have closed it on the paragraph would be because it could be like a sign from above like when this happens then you will be married and sure enough when that thing happens you are getting warned so maybe it was a sign from @CAPS1 or another world saying that when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again So in conclusion I think that the hibiscus was a symbol of her life saying that shes out of place but can continue living like the hibiscus and also it could be a symbol from @CAPS1.
3,"The author of the story concluded with sentence to show starting snow after everything that happened . When she first, failed Saeng  was very upset ,and probody wanted to give up you can tell this is true because of the words in the last sentence. Standing out the fact that she wants to continue of tagll snows that she must have been thinking of some point of giving up. Giving up and winter both symodies  the idea of something ending, whether r it be  the hope Saeng would have gotten had she have passed, or the ending of the year. Ending, in turn is generally met with gainess or greff because everything couldnt be accomplished, or something bad happened Saeng going into the flower shop and seeing the pisets from her old country bought both joy of going something fanitac  and pain because the memories she has time will never come again. However this joy she felt is the starting of a new beginning, just like a flower blooming or the geese returning. Its a new beginning where, whether  good or bad, the past is in the past and although you can look back of all the good times, there is nothing you can do about bad, so you  should learn from those things and do better. This ending sentence is like a moral, not just for Saeng, but for others who have been in similar situations before."
3,"The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saengs mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saengs mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives."
3,"The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed drivers test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengs eyes now swept over her. Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saengs mouth watered,, The winter hibiscus was in the ground now, and, overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and  yes  Familiar to Saeng now. This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saengs newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it. "
3,"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. I will  take that test again, This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote, when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return, is referring to when she says, She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become  almost familiar to her. Like the geese, She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter. When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass."
3,"The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that shell take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng s eyes now swept over her. Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that people can adopt and still go on when in a new environment. After Saeng has declared she has failed she goes on to say, ""Not like the the kind we had before ...""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" Her mother reassures her that it will survive because it has adapted to the environment. It emmulates the concluding sentence. Even though Saeng thinks she has failed she goes on to plant the plant and not give up on it. ""The 'winter hibiscus' was the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it"". She began to take care of it so that it would survive she's not giving up because it's different. Which is similar to the way in which Saeng should look at her new home. Her mother  gave her the push but Saeng @CAPS1 the job by helping her mother dig. ""Here, let me help, mother."" Saeng began to try again. just as she needs to do with the test. The concluding sentence is used because it emmulates how she moves on through the struggles in her story. She goes back just like the geese will eventually. Even though she failed she will try again just like everyone must including the plants and animals who go through the different seasons."
3,"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time when the shows me. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, Saeng  brokedown and wept! The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the show will melt and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as yet another old friend. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."
3,"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because its sympatizing Saeng ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance.this is symbolised by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus"" After fail of the test. She wasn't own considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adopt the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it,because just like her the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, @CAPS1 bloom in the spring so must she last through the weather to pass in the spring. That is why the author consider the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, A sured that  to pass"
3,"In winter hibiscus, by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story like that so to make an almost finalie defined theme. The words themselves end greatly with the story, but because of the few themes it shows really makes the ending something beyond great. The first of a few themes I had gotten from the ending said something along the lines of, having to move away from the hard work pass and start new again. This represents two things that happened in the story. The flower has to go through a possible harsh winter, representing the past in when Saeng lived in Vietnam and her failing the driving test. However when that spring time comes around and the flower survives full of new life it gives new hope, as to how Saeng moved to the united states and how she is going to take the drivers test. It is a tough journey, but to survive it shows new great door to open and start again being stronger than before by letting go of the journey, sense it is now behind you. The words could have also left you hanging yes, but mostly to wonder what the future will hold for Saeng. Will she be able to move on, and when spring comes around can she pass her drivers test. We never know the future so it sets up as an odd theme."
3,"In the short story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho she ends the story by saying, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I-I failed the test. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to start over again or to try again. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to start life again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual."
3,"The author of  Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho end the story with the statement, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again, because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese  mignitry and the Winter  Hibiscus Saeng, realized that many of the things that she had thought  of as strange before had become, through the guiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and Winter Hibiscus. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. The familiar  fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could  almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed. The jolont made her think of good experiences. In the plant made her joyous enough not to think about past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States   "
3,"The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her drivers test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (and this hibiscus is budding), the author depicts Saengs change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the drivers test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saengs new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saengs mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (when the snow melts and the geese return). This shows Saengs development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
3,"The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was acustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the u.s. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam, Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the green house along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the @LOCATION2 she had nothing that was familiar to her.  Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do."
3,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states,  she noticed the tearstains on her daughters cheeks and her puffy eyes[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now [@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese."
3,"The author concluded the story, Winter Hibiscus, with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again."
3,"The author of Winter Hibiscus ends the story on a strong note. The author makes the hibiscus plant seem so great.  Like the plant is motivation for saeng.  Unfortutnly  saeng doesnt pass her test.She is very sad adont this and looks for something to comfort her She looks to the hibiscus plant. She vowes silently as a promise to herself that when that plant buds in spring  she will take the test again. She is kooking forward to seeing this beautiful plant bloom again. When it does she knows she will take the test. Saeng is determined as well. Im confident that when she retakes the test she will pass. The main reason I feel the author ends this story like this because they want to show hope. They want to convey a sence of what is yet to come. When the flower blooms and is beautiful the time is just right to take the test. This test means a lot to saeng .so does the plant. Saeng uses the plant as motivation. Thats why the author chose to end the story they way they did. In conclusion this story is about getting motivated, and how even simple things like plants can remind you of your homeland. This then leads you to peace which leads you to happiness. Thats why the author ended the story the way they did.                   "
3,"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho ends by showing a ray of hope. Saeng is terribly upset about moving away from Vietnam but the hibiscus gives her hope. The hibiscus adapts to the winter to be able to survive. It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus."" The hibiscus gives the hope that if it can make it through the hardships in her life. Another part of the last paragraph that gives hope that she can adapt is when she sees the geese flying ahead. Geese adapted to winter as well and she will be able to adapt also. She at first felt likes the geese were strange but now she realizes that they a constant with every season, they don't change the situation does. It helps Saeng realize she doesn't have to change to be in the new country she can stay the same as the situation changes. ""the quiet repetition of season upon season"". Lastly it tells the reader that she will rise above this experience. She vows to try and take the driver test again which shows that she is not going to give and that she will adapt to this new lifestyle just as the hibiscus plants and geese adapt to the winter. Saeng has hope that her future will be okay. "
3,"The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are a like and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saengs obstacle is adjusting to her new life and the first step in that is passing her drivers test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother , I-I failed the @NUM1]. The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surrounding to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng, but its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus.Thats what matter [@NUM2]. So,if the winter hibiscus job, or hurdle that it has to jump,it to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself,  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again[@NUM2]. If Saengs obstacle is completing, and passing the drivers test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes its test , the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirits to adopt, will grow deeper because that will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time."
3,"In the story winter Hibiscus the author Minfong Ho ends with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" she ended with this show her determination to do good in her country and show that memories of her grandmother help her to strive for the best in her new country, in her new home. In the beginning of the story Saeng is at a flower shop and she sees all the flowers of her home country growing in poto. At the sight of all these flowers memories flood back to her, memories that bring her joy and sadness. Then when she returns home she tells her mother that she failed the test you can tell from her actions that she is disappointed, I-I failed the test  Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye  nervously tore off a leab,shredding it to bits. After a while she planted the flower in the vegetable garden. The buying and planting of the vegetable shows that Saeng wants to remember her grandmother and home. Thinking  about her grandmother helps her to survive for better, helps her want to succeed in her new home. Memories of her grandmother make her sad but in away make her happy.  "
3,"The author concludes the story with that particular sentence for serveral reasons. Saeng is upset about failing her driver's test, and buys the winter hibiscus. Saeng is comforted by things that remind her of home, and thats why she bought that plant. Saeng says how the plant isnt like the one at home and her mother replys, flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold. Saeng then later sees the geese overhead and says when they come backin the spring,. when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again The author ended it that way because Saeng is just like the winter hibicus. Since thisis her new country she is like the winter hibicus because it isnt like the ones at(home) and since she now lives here she isnt her usual self. But, the last paragraph when the snow melt. Is where she is adapting to her new home as well as the hibiscus is budding then Saeng will be strong enough to make it through the cold like her mother implied at the winter hibiscus. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph is because hes showing the similities between the winter hibisicus and Saeng and how they will adapt in this season/in this new country."
3,"There are many reasons wht the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness and seing fact ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test"" this quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failled a very important test and she is walking alone. ""She sees a familier plant"" is when the hope comes back into the story. When she brings the plant she had purchased here to her mother also sees delinlted. "" where did you get it?"" her mother aasked, and Saeng replied ""I bought it."" She bought it for @MONEY1 more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on it was clear to her mother the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter and endyat the plant with have as well I remember a time upon my mother bought me a work-candle cat desdion. I felt it was a waist of money, but when @CAPS1 saw her light delights for I it with love as well. When Saeng's mother felt have from thr plants made Saeng happy and gave her courage the driver's test again. is the reason why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. "
3,"The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengs eyes now swept over her (Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center  just as she had known it would feel (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail."
3,"Reading the last paragraph of winter hibiscus brings forth a revelation that has occurred within her. To clarify it shows Saengs new acceptance of her new country, @LOCATION1. In a sense, the hibiscus of the story is the link between her original home and her new home. In her original home, she carried fond memories of the hibiscus flower, memories that carry over to @LOCATION1.  After failing her driving test and seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng weeps over her fond memories of her old country. Her missed feelings for her old home are clearly displayed when it tells, she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. After speaking with her mother though and planting the winter hibiscus, she finds a new acceptance and familiarity in @LOCATION1. Take the line a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. we are shown how Saeng has grown accustomed to her new country. In the last paragraph, when telling of the melting snow, returning geese and winter hibiscus, Saeng is telling of what she has grown so familiar and accepting with in her new country. With that new support, Saeng feels she will be able to successfully retake her driving test. An ending is provided that gives a new outlook for Saeng. "
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saengs new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states,"" its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel. Saengs past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saengs new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world."
3,"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus, by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow in order to give a there of hope and show that the hibiscus represents Saeng. She're this by giving closure, and the author's comments. If the author chose to not include Saeng's vow in the story, it would still be a good conclusion. However, the author wants to clearly show that Saeng is not giving up. She says, ""when... this hibiscus is budding, i will take the test again. Her determination puts emphasis on the theme of hope and not giving up. Saeng's vow shows that the winter hibiscus symbolizes Saeng.Saeng said that the winter hibiscus was ""Not like the kind he had before. Her mother replied,"" It flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus."" The mother knows that Saeng isn't as happy in @LOCATION1 as in Vietnam and that's why she says it is flower aren't that pretty"" representing Saeng's emotions. However, the mother also says that ""it'sstrong enough to make it through this maening that Saeng will be able to get through this down point in her life. The mother's comments and Saeng's vow give the story closure and show that saeng is a winter hibiscus that will survive to see the spring."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus, the author concludes the story with a paragraph that says, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. the author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has gotten over her failure with the driving test and is determined to try again next year. After she failed the driving test, Saeng felt that she didnt belong, so she went to a flower shop in which there were plants that reminded her of Vietnam. There she ends up buying a hibiscus. While she is planting the hibiscus, a flock of geese goes by overhead and she realizes shes gotten used to the geese. It says, Overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now. When she realizes she really has started to belong and adapt to her new country, she realizes if she can adjust and adapt to living in a new country, she can easily get through failing her driving test. With renewed determination she says that she will take the driving test again. That is why in the story Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with the previously mentioned paragraph."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus ,there is a main character named Saeng .Saeng near the endis starting to explain how important the spring is.She explalains how silent it is and how comforting it is to her.The  spring  is very important to her and loves to watch all of the geese return back every year.Then after the geese return the  hibiscus then start budding out.She enjoys watching of all this happening then she gets to look forward to all this happening again next year.In the spring ,there is corner where she plants a vegetable  patch and then watches all the vegetables grow so she can pick them and  then eat all of them.That also happens every year.Then she will the breeze and the wind go by every year and she enjoys it so much that she does this everyday As the seasons change she will watch all of the changes happen and enjoy every minute of it and then she will wait again till spring and watch all of the wornderful changes happen all over again like the geese coming back ,hibiscus blossoming out and to able to watch the wind breeze on by.She loves it so much because it is very silent everytime  she goes their because there is never any noise whenever she will then stop there and enjoy the breeze"
3,"Nature has its beautys and Saeng found natures buety in a hibiscus plant. The plant helped her overcome many things such a struggles, when she could find new friends. when she was stressed from school work she would go gardening. Also Saeng has her comfort of her homeland from this plant since they moved. This is @CAPS1 hobby and what she desires to do.""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again''. Saeng will give her life a retry at things she culd of done like make friends and do school work @CAPS2 to the hibiscus she believes she can.Nature has its beautys and Saeng found natures buety in all Hibiscus plant. The plant helped her overcome many things such a struggles, when she could find new friends. when she was stressed from school work she would go gardening. Also Saeng has her comfort of her homeland from this plant since they moved. This is @CAPS1 hobby and what she desires to do.""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng will give her life a retry at things she culd of done like make friends and do school work @CAPS2 to the hibiscus she believes she can."
3,"The reasoning behind the ending of Winter Hibiscus is left for the reader to determine. These are many ideas one could take away from this passage but one imparticular stands out to me. This idea that is given to me through references throughout the story is in relation to persistence. Persistence is something that is noted all through the story in small details. When teh author is telling about the mothers activities is say as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden showing he toughness in taking care of her garden even in uncomfortable weather. The mother and her daughter are clearly both new to the country and miss their old home. This adaptation takes persevierence and showing that she is getting used to her new home it says things that she had thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar to her now. The references to the geese in the last paragraph are put there to show how the geese make a hard long journey every year and that she realizes like the geese, she too is on a hard long journey. Persevierence is the main idea that is communicated to me through the last paragraph. Its placing I believe is to drill in that main point of @CAPS1 on keeping on."
3,"I think the author of Winter Hibiscus finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."
3,"At the end of the short story, winter Hibiscus, the writer Minfong Ho includes somewhat inspirational concluding sentence when they come back  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future.    "
3,"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saengs decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying  I will try again next spring  to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says , Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now. At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now shes use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, shes been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that shell take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive."
3,"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saengs life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her drivers test, Saeng sees a flower and says, [I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had becomealmost familiar to her now. Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  "
3,"I think the author is trying to show his love for @DATE1 in the paragraph. Like were it saides (in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again). I think that he showing his true felling for @DATE1. Then were it saides (then I will take that test again) I think he saying that his ready to take his chanes with the cold, and @CAPS1  winther again. That show that his gets really sad when it comes to a cold winther. Then happy, love, and full of energy when it comes to @DATE1. The author acts just like me when its very, very cold Im tiered, and very sad I do nothing like go out and play, sleep, do work, or even injoy the snow. But when it come to @DATE1 I do everything like skateboarding, swimming, ride bikes, restol around with my friends, relase under a tree, and at night I count the stars with my friends Im just full with energy just like the author acts when winther and @DATE1 comes. That what I think the author was trying to show people in the paragraph about the way of winther, and @DATE1 being fun or boarding to him in these one little paragraph.  "
3,"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and dont  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."
3,The author concludes the story by Saeng nowing a promise to herself. She says that when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding(Ho) she will take the test again. She is say that when spring comes around Saeng will go back to the greenery to buy new flowers for the spring. The author concludes the story like this to get the message across that Saeng will be persistent and get through the hard times she is facing. She is having trougle in her life with accepting  her new country and the things that go on there. She is very homesick and misses the things that she loved most about her old home. She misses I her grandmother and every time she smells or sees the flowers that are familiar to her she gets upset. When she goes to retake the test she wants to prove to herself that she is strong and she is going to adapt and change *under the circumstances. Saeng wants to prove to herself that she can survive and be a strong person no matter what anybody throws her way. The author concludes this to show the reader how in bad situations or circumstances humans will fight to survive and adapt and that we are all strong as individuals and as a group. 
3,"@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1 â All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this âWhen They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesnât want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph"
3,"In the passage Winter @CAPS1, the author closely concludes the stoy of Saeng vowing that she will take the test once again. By analyzing the reading it can be clear to why it was ended this way The story begins with Saeng failing the drivers text and walking home. While doing so she noticed a flower that was available back in her country, and so she purchases this in order to give to her dissappointing mother a flower of her native country. Although this is not directly stated in the reading It becomes obivious. And is also somewhat proven as it lifts the burden on her mother, because when she found out she failed th test she became almosl furious, For a long moment @PERSON1 said thing in her mother reached out and and said its a beautiful plant! From this the readers can see that the mother was dissapointed, but hid it in her because of the flower. But @CAPS2/ reason she wanted to retake is also strongly shown in the second to past paragraph where she sees the geese comes to a conclusion,  she reilized that many of the things she had thought strang, thoug quite repitition of season, had become similar... this showed vowed she had to repeatedly take the test until sucesesful."
3,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, because it shows That Saeng isnt going to stay down. It shows That The hibiscus will overcome winter, like Saengs mother says,'but its strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus Thats what matters. This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only failing The drivers test, but also moving to @LOCATION1. She isnt The same as she was back home, but shes strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking The test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everyThing is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saengs promise to herself That she will get past The challenges in front of her, and @CAPS1 to come. When Saeng says ...When the snows melt... it symbolizes The time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take The test with a new out look on her life. The author concludes The story with This paragraph because it shows That Saeng isnt going to stay down."
3,"The author ends the story with this paragraph, When they come back, @CAPS1 vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again. because Winter and spring have a symbolic meaning, to Saeng. Winter is cold and isnt easy to get through, Saeng is still struggling to adapt her new home. When she saw the Jasmine plant it brought back memortes of her grandmother and Vietnam. She then felt A wave of loss so deep and strong."" This loss of her home is hard for her to process. Winter is the same thing. Spring represents renewal of things the start of something new, Saeng at the storys end realized that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" she realized she has made a home . When the spring arrives she can start again on life. The same thing she had to do coming to a new land. The adjusting was her winter and the spring is her new start symbolize what shell do. What she want to do is take her drivers test again to initiate her new start."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with a very moving paragraph . It reads when they  come back , saeng  vowed silently to herself , in the spring when the snows melt the geese this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again ,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to add deeper thought  the story. One example of the depth of the last paragraph the determination of saeng .The quote shows how although she has failed once already she will keep trying until she passes the test. The quote that shows this is when she says when they come back  then I will take that test again. Another example of the depth of the last paragraph is how the author incorporates symbolism into it.  The author shows symbolism in the last paragraph by relating saeng to nature. Its states when the snows melt the geese return this hibiscus is budding, then. I will take that test again . This quote shows how the author made saeng one with nature by showing how when the sunshine the geese , the hibiscus return as well. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to add depth to the story to give the reader a feeling of excitement of motivation.  "
3,"In the story winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng refuse to give up. For example, in the story, she had failed the test; Saeng decided that it would be better to retake the test to be better in life. In the story, there are many symbolism objects that is describe in the story. For example, in the winter, snow is pure, white and it glistens in the sun. During the winter, plants die when its very brisk and cold. In the spring, plants start to grow and birds come back from the south. In the spring time Saeng hopes to start from a new beginning. For example when theres spring, everything begins with a brand new start. Such as animals, plants and also people. For people such as Saeng, spring is a season to start over and achieve new goals. Although Saeng failed the test during the winter, she hopes to pass and achieve that test during the spring, where theres a new beginning."
3,"The author decided to conclude the story with the paragraph given in order to give a powerful statement that wraps up the story well. In the paragraph, Saeng is explaining when she takes the drivers test again, everything in her life will be at a new, fresh start and she will be able to let go of the past. At the beginning of the story, it says that Saeng had failed her drivers test. Then, throughout the middle of the story, memories of Saengs past are revealed when she sees a familiar plant, making her sad. This shows that Saeng misses her old life, perhaps in her homeland, and is feeling out of place and lost in this new world. In the paragraph at the very end of the story, Saeng is vowing that when nature and the world around her takes a fresh start, so will she in this new life. She was saying that she will no longer be hung up on memories of the past but instead make new memories and be successful, thus having a new start. The author intentionally conveyed this message of Saengs future to the reader in order to tell them that Saeng will be able to move on, therefore giving a powerful, final statement that ends the story."
3,I think the author includes this because she doesnt want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then I will take the test again. This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you dont no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.
3,"Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have."
3,"The author concludes the story with in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.     "
3,"When the author ended the story with 'When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again' this signaled not really the end of the story, but the beginning of something new. In a way, I feel that Saeng is very much like the hibiscus: Saeng has been put into a completely new environment away from her home and everything she loved, but shes still surviving, just like the hibiscus,  Ive seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here she winter hibiscus. Thats what matters. The flower will survive and adopt just like @ORGANIZATION1, when a flower is budding, it is starting anew from a bud, it has a fresh start, and when @ORGANIZATION1 says 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again this is like when the flower begins all over again she will to, her and the hibiscus will grow along with each other and continue to adopt, survive and even love the environment in which they are placed."
3,"The author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng would now try to get used to living in @LOCATION1 and leave behind her regrets about not staying in Vietnam. This is evident while Saeng is in the garden planting the hibiscus. As she is just about finished patting earth around the plant, Saeng heard and saw a flock of Canada geese fly by. She knew right away that it was geese when she heard their honk and, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. The fact that many things in @LOCATION1 were almost familiar to her now shows that Saeng doesnt seem to mind the different world of @LOCATION1 as much anymore, knowing that she can recognize many things that there hadnt been in Vietnam. Also, when it says Almost reluctantly, it is shown that Saeng just holds a grudge because @LOCATION1 is not her true home. However, despite her desire to go back to Vietnam and have things the way they used to be, the last paragraph shows how Saeng is willing to start giving @LOCATION1 a try and to put the past behind her.  "
3,"The author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus with When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself I will take that test again, shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saengs good character. It shows Saengs strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."
3,"When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The story winter hibiscus ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, Ive seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters. Saeng is the winter hibiscus thats strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test wont matter until spring when she will take it and pass. Thats represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saengs feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. Its also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring."
3,"In the story Winter Hibiscus. The author ends the story with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can over then so can she. In the story after the author had failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home & connected her to her past making her felt less alone. For example, when the author says A wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saengs eyes now swept over her. That shows that she misses her home and the flower gave her a way to move deeply connect to her memories, also when she says like the geese the distinctive V against the sky. That shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new. Making her feel that if they can adapt and change so will she over time In conclusion the ending was to futher emphasize her feeling towards her hometown and the new town she lives in."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saengs outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are familiar to Saeng now  despite her thinking of them as strange before. The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saengs vow that she will take that test again in the spring, When the snows meltetc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saengs past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The authors wording was very well done."
3,"The story, Winter Hibiscus, is about a girl who failed her drivers test and walks past a flower shop. She sees a flower that reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam. The story ends with the paragraph, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because it shows that although she isnt home the rutine of the flower budding and the geese returning will make her feel at home and it will be easier to take the test. One reason the author ends the story with this paragraph is to show when she starts to feel more at home she will want to take the test again. For example, the text states, geese flew by familiar to Saeng now. @CAPS1 the text states, ... she had thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar. @CAPS2 examples show she wanted to feel more at home before she took the test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story with the paragraph to show she wanted feel more at home before she took the test again and the geese returning would represent her feeling more at home.   "
3,"The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,I-I failed the test, Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!"
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she knows that everything can be right again. Even though she lost her childhood and the place where. she grew up, she is willing to start over. Shes saying that once the hibiscus is budding and the geese return, she can start over. She is willing to start a new life in her new world. The whole story is talking about how upset she is about being in a new country, missing her grandmother, and missing everything else about her childhood. When she sees the plant from her childhood country, it brings comfort to see something that means something to her. She gets upset though because she sees how out of place she is in this new country and how she wishes she were in her childhood again. When she gets home and shows the plant to her mother, she realizes that things in this new country have also become familiar to her. She knows that this is where she lives now and she can set things right in this new, Familiar country. Shes saying that once she is fully ready and understands her new home, shell be ready to take the driving test and start a new life."
3,"I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character  Saeng is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her drivers test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again."
3,The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt
3,"In the story Winter hibiscus it ended with Saeng stating when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. The author ended the story like this to show how determined Saeng was to please her mother who she hates so much to disappoint her. In the story Saeng came home with a plant that she had payed with all the money she had, her mother stated But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didnt cost that much! @CAPS1 she had disappointed her mother by trying to please her made Saeng want to do something to make her mom happy. This is what she means by Then I will take that test again. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and of her mother. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she know it would this relates to the ending and the hibiscus budding because the hibiscus flower mean a lot to Saeng. In conclusion they use this ending to convey how much her mother means to her and to make her proud."
3,"New begining, determination, motivation all are why I think the athor ended the story with, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, to show new beging, determination and motivation because, When saeng faild her licenend test she was discouraged and didnt know how to cope with it until she absorbed with a plant called hibiscus and seen how it growed from it obsticales of going through the cold concrete fenses and fo planting, but when it gets all through the problems and spring comes back around and its budds Start to grow it becomes the most bright and beautiful flower ever. So saeng motivation and determination come from this plants growth She relates it to her struggles and obstacles and knowing that when you got through you problems the result is beautiful like the plant so the author is relating the conclusion to show a new beginning of Saeng re take of the drving test and to show she learned to coupe with failure and go araind on the obticles she have to take just like when she takes her driving test."
3,"The author concluded the story Winter Hibiscus  the way she did because she wanted to show saeng s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, she was still too shaky to say the words at home .  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although shed had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,I failed the test , and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saengs determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in winter Hibiscus is used to show saengs determination."
3,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, for several reasons, @CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saengs mother says that it is strong enough to make it through, and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese sound familiar. As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, shes starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again."
3,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has changed and that who the @CAPS1 comes she will be a new person and ready to try to overcome her obstacles again. First, the narrator says, she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance, (Ho @NUM1). The geese are flying away to hibernate in the winter and ending are both archetypes for death and endings (Ho @NUM1). In Saengs case it represents the end of her old past life. In contrast, the spring is a archetype for rebirth and new beginings. This means that in the spring Saeng will be a new person with a clean slate and ready to try again. Also, the hibiscus represents determination. The narrator stated, back home it grew wild, justing out from the cracks in brick walls or between filed roofs, afraid to adapt and is determined to survive. Just like the hibiscuc, Saeng is ready to bloom and be brave as she confronts all her obstacles in her home with force determination. Though the hibiscus Saeng will be reborn and find the strength she needed to survive and pass her driving test."
3,"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral. The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why and the geese return. is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you plant yourself you can thrive with confidence. "
4,"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."
4,"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."
4,"In the memoir, of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" he talks about how greatful he is fo his parents. Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for so much in his life and I recognize that because he thanks his parents for what they have done to make his familys life better. He shows his thanks by writing this memoir and how his parents tell him how much they had to sacrafise for him to be in @LOCATION1. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (paragraph @NUM1). This shows true dedication to the family and how they wanted to have a better life. Before Narciso lived in his ""home"" he lived in an apartment were he was very happy with his mother he enjoyed the same things @CAPS1 liked to do, and other traditional things. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for wich I am extremely greatful). Passionate Cuban music wich I adore to this day) (paragraph @NUM2). This is showing he is very thankful for his parents to bring back such culinary skills to shair them with him. Lastly I know his mood in this is thankfulness because he thanks his parents for everything because he knows they have made his life a lot better by making their decisions to live here. ""I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood and the many things I learned there about how to love)"" (paragraph seven). This quote is showing how much he cared for his family and how thankful things turned out to have a great childhood. He loved hearing about how much his parents sacrafised for him and he thanks them everyday and wishes he chould do something worth full like his parents did."
4,"Based on the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a very grateful mood in the text. For example, Rodriguez first mentions how his parents passed on the cultural gifts of music and food he still enjoys and is thankful for today. He raves, ""My parents [passed on] to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day)....""in paragraph @NUM1. The parenthesis further emphasize his gratitude towards his parents cultural backgrounds being passed down to him, putting in his opinions on what he's stating in the text. Second, in paragraph @NUM2 Rodriguez vividly describes and admires his parents courage and determination in coming to @LOCATION1 for the sake of their children. He says "" In [the @LOCATION2], they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure those hard times. ""@CAPS1, Rodriguez expresses his gratitude towards his parents for being so brave and selfless to benefit his own life. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3 Rodriguez explains how thankful he is for the lessons of family and love his parents have taught him. He writes, ""in But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" This quote demonstrates the real significance of his parents in his life and once @CAPS1, he continuously thinks his parents and mentions his gratefulness for the lessons they have taught him and how much they've effected his life. Based on the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author makes a grateful mood throughout the text."
4,"This memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a mood that shows Narciso Rodriguez is happy, proud of his parents, and the memoir creates a mood of unity. First, the memoir creates a happy mood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez is happy that at his home his families, friends, and celebrations helped form usual life in his house. He is happy is parents worked so hard to get him to New Jersey. Rodriguez is happy about how welcoming his parents were to people who needed help, and how during segregation, his family and friends stayed together. ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" had an incredibly happy mood. Next, the memoirs mood shows that Rodriguez is obviously proud of his hardworking parents. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso Rodriguez is so proud of his parents giving up so many things for him. They gave up their families, friends, country, and careers all for their son, so he could live a better life in the @LOCATION2. They basically had to start over this pursuit to get good careers. Finally, the mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" brings about a sense of unity. ""Growing up in this environment inspired in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (paragraph @NUM3) In Rodriguez's family, they took in people who need help, who aren't in their family. During a time of segregation, this neighbors, families, and friends stayed united. In ""Narciso Rodriguez, The mood created shows that Rodriguez is happy, proud of his parents, an the memoir shows a sense of unity."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic, warm, and thankful. In the memoir the author explains the importance of family, recounts his experiences with family, and thanks his family for all the important life lesson they have taught him. In paragraph two the author says: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This excerpt conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author praises his childhood home. In paragraph three the author says: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sentence also makes the reader feel nostalgic and warm because the author really gives the reader a sense of his childhood community's unity and love. In paragraph five the author says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" In this sentence the author really conveys his @CAPS1 of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them. In paragraph six the author says: ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and Friends are."" And later in paragraph seven: ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'Family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These excerpts really sum up the author's @CAPS1 about family. They explained to the reader how really important Family is and how thankful the author is for his family and all the life lessons they have taught him. These excerpts really convey the @CAPS1 of nostalgia, warmth, and thankfulness to the reader."
4,"Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, he potrays a happy, uplifting, positive mood that explains how close his family was and what being a family means to him. It also describes how grateful he is toward his parents and how proud he is of his Cuban culture.First of all, Narciso believes that to be a family, you don't have to be blood related to that person. In paragraph @NUM1, he says: "" All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close  knit community"" This quote explains how much he valued his friends, neighbors, and other family members; and how all three of these categories formed the house he called home.Secondly, the mood of the memoir was not only centered around family and friends, but Narciso also showed much gratitude toward his parents. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" And the later in paragraph @NUM3. he says, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" These two quotes explain how much he admires his parents, and this feeling of admiration and thanks played large part in the mood of Narciso's memoir.Finally, @PERSON2's Cuban pride was another large contributor in the mood of this excerpt.

And all three of these things helped make his ""house a home."""
4,"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful if because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents. This is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the author said ""they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrears in the country they loved"" This quote from @CAPS1 @NUM1 shows how grateful Narciso is of his parents leaving everything they had to make a better life for him. The last sentence of the memoir is ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This is showing that the mood is Grateful because Narciso means that he's is thankful because they were able to turn their little house into a place of great friendships and great times. The last reason this article has a mood relative to thankfullness is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM3 when Narciso says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never repay his parents for their selflessness and care. The reason this article is also happy is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM4 when he talks of ""the endless celebrations"" or ""a love of cooking that is still with me today... ""This is showing the ""mood is happy and joyous because it is clear that as a boy the kitchen and cooking were a source of happiness and @CAPS2 in his home. These are reasons as to why the author has created memoir with a mood of happiness and gratefulness"
4,"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", written by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a grateful and thankful mood. The author shares information about his childhood and how his parents provided moral and emotional support through not only kind words, but through their actions. This mood starts to show right away in paragraph @NUM1, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author illustrates his appreciation of what his parents made his home to be growing up, he felt secure and this warmsetting provided a sense of peace in the author's mind. His parents instilled in him life lessons which is shown in paragraph @NUM2 ""These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me.

The mood and tone represented throughout this memoir shows up many times, and you can learn important lessons from the things the author writes about in this memoir."
4,"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very @CAPS1 way. The author talks about his love of cooking, how his parents want to give their children a better life by moving to @LOCATION1 leaving loved ones behind, and the author @CAPS1 his house.The kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author. His parents was very skilled in cooking, which passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph @NUM1, "" A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author's love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about @LOCATION1, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their loved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph @NUM2, it explains what the parents had to. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows the parents realy loved their children wanted them to be happy. Finnaly, the last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" states how the narator feels love for his parents and his home. This all shows that the narrator is happy with his family in pleased of where he lives. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is @CAPS1 . The author shows this by @CAPS1 the culinary art his parents, and his home.  He is grateful for what he has, and has love for his family and home."
4,"The author creates a loving mood in the memoir. He does this by describing his house, his parents attitude towards others, and the neighborhood that he grew up in. First of all, the author describes his house to create a loving mood the memoir when he talks about what made his house such a ""warm"" place. The author states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in or warm home"" (@NUM1). This description of his childhood home creates a loving mood. It gives you the feeling of being welcomed and loved if you just walked in one day. Likewise, he describes how his parents were loving and caring towards others, and that creates a loving mood. He comments ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (@NUM2). This excerpt from the memoir shows how loving his parents were and how they ""always kept their arms and their door open"". By the author describing his parents loving attitude towards people, it makes you feel that love too. Which is why the author creates a loving mood in the memoir. Lastly, he depicts how loving his neighborhood. He talks about what kind of the neighborhood it is. He describes it as ""a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who... were clearly in need"" (@NUM3). This description shows how close and loving the people in the neighborhood were to each other. They were ""close knit"" or like family. To know how loving it is makes the reader feel that loving mood that the author creates. That is why I leave the mood created in the memoir is a loving one."
4,"One should be proud of their heritage and keep memories of the past with them. In the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso is greatful for his parents and their background, their sense of loving and how they came to @LOCATION3 for their children.Narciso explains to the reader's his family and where they lived. His parents both grew up in Cuba and later migrated to the United States in 1956. Narciso was born in 1961 and at the time, his parents were living in Newark, New Jersey. They had their homes designed like a traditional Cuban home, with the kitchen right in the middle, which symbolized a heart. Narciso's parents taught him how to cook because they loved it as well and Narciso declares that he is, ""eternally greatful"" for.Narciso's parents also show a great sense of love. They never discluded anyone from joining them and enjoyed company. Narciso's surrogate grandparents lived in the same house and were greatful for that opportunity. The Rodriguez's also let extended family stay with them; and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their own feet. They also had their arms open to everyone and would let them stay at their home. This shows how much this family cares about other people.Many @MONTH1 think that @ORGANIZATION1 and Rawedia Maria came to the United States, selflessly, but they did it for a reason. They left their families, friends and their occupations behind in Cuba so they could create better lives for their future children. They gave up all they had for their children and this goes to show that Narciso's parents love him very much and cared so much about him that they were willing to risk their lives to give him a better life."
4,"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author, Narciso Rodriguez created a mood throughout the memoir of his home and Family. Narciso talks about how lucky he was to have had such a wonderful home where he belonged and a family that was always there for him. Narciso put it best in the last few lines of his memoir that say ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""A big mood in the memoir was a feeling of warmth and happiness, an enviroment where everyone was family, a strong sense of community, togetherness and belonging, that love, care, family and friendship is always there, and that this was home, always and forever. ""In our neighborhood,... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need... My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us.""@CAPS1 mood in the memoir was a feeling of strong love and gratefulness Narciso felt for his parents. They were strong, courageous, selfless and brave, and they gave up so much to give Narciso a better life."" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" The author created a mood of his home and family in the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."""
4,"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). You can almost feel how grateful he is for is happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing. Finally, there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home and, like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir."
4,"The author creates a loving, warm mood that is felt throughout all of @PERSON1's memoir. For example, ""...passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents loved to cook, something he remembers fondly, and he shares their love to this day. The reader feels this love when reading the line. The reader feels how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence. He even states how much he adores Cuban music even now. Another example, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 even says ""warm home,"" and warmth is definitly felt while reading this line. The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's writing. one final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a feel of how much Rodriguez loves his parents. @PERSON1 even says  ""love."" His parents are loving people and so is @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts greatly in his memoir."
4,"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Wether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind."
4,"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" taken from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", a happy, loving and grateful mood is created. Towards the beginning of the memoir, Rodriguez describes the setting of his childhood home. He portrays the scenary as ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."", which would make the reader feel delighted at the feeling of being in that home. The thought of home  cooking and light music with the smells of cooking food would bring a smile to anyone's face. The sense of living in a home where your most comfurtable is a comforting feeling. This happy mood is also accompanied by the mood of loving. As Rodriguez explains how his family didn't need blood relation to share the love, he describes the many family members who he encounterred. He talks about how his home was a home to many other relatives who came and went ""until they were able to get thier feet back on the ground"", which shows the love amongst the Rodriguez family to others who were in the same situation they were not too long ago. He describes his parents as always keeping ""thier arms and door open"" showing kindness to many people. A mood of gratefulness is also found in the memoir. Narciso explains numerous times how thankful he is to his parents for the sacrifice they made for him. He even states ""there is no way to express my gratitude"" showing he is so grateful for his life and parents sacrifices he can't even deliver all of it. Narciso Rodriguez will always have a place in his heart for his childhood memories and ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
4,"The mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This demonstrates love beond comperashin seening as they had to start over from scratch steping down far benith there potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give there children a better life than they would have had. Also this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the famley but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 "" Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants"" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close  knit community of honest hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessary their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise. His parrents also kept their doors open and alowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet. Knowing that they would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throghout this memoir that illistrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness."
4,"The mood that the author creates in his memoir is a feeling of togetherness and respect for each other. Throughout the memoir, the author is constantly giving praise to his parents as well as always taking the time to say how lucky he was to have such a cultural childhood. The author appears to have nothing negative at all to say to the readers about his childhood. @CAPS1 can really feel the love and respect for his family. On page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2, the memoir states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 can almost feel the warmth and love in his writing @CAPS2 there. @CAPS1 can also feel the strong sense of connection towards his ""family"" and his roots. On page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM4, it says ""It was in a warmth for kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". @CAPS1 can get a feeling of love, trust and togetherness all in these statements. His love for his family and where they came from is truly amazings. The author clearly states in all of the memoir what can happen with a good family and a feel for one's heritage. To wrap up the mood of the memoir simply is in the last statement, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 there pretty clearly summarizes the love of his parents and the happiness he got during his childhood. For these reasons, I really get the sense of family, love and respect when I read this memoir."
4,"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is accomplished. Rodriguez explains her backgrounds and where her parents came from. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez states, ""my parents, originally from  Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, ""Here, around 1956 Rodriguez's family lived in a small home and many people lived in it at once. Narciso and @PERSON2 moved out the small aparment into a better home. Her mother and father made a sacrifice. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez  states, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Here, her parents gave up many things to provide and make a better life than what they had growing up in Cuba. Rodriguez explains how thankful @CAPS1 is of her parents to show how much they care about their children succeeding in @LOCATION2. In paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did and was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 thanks her parents for giving her the best life while they put their life on hold. @CAPS1 tells her parents how immigrating to @LOCATION2 was the biggest sacrifice anyone ever done. In conclusion, the mood of this memoir is so touching and Rodriguez dream was accomplished and @CAPS1 succeeded in @LOCATION2 like her parents wanted her to. "
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir I think is a warm feeling of home and being with family. I think this because in @CAPS1 @NUM1, and it shows how grateful he is of his parents. One quote is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" @CAPS2 obviously this persons parents made a huge impact on his life.Another reason that he is so grateful of his parents is because they turned his house into a home. They made his house something more than just a place, but it will be a place that he will always remember for the rest of his lif. It's the place where he spent he first birthday and where he met his first friend. It shows all thing in the seventh @CAPS1. He really explains the defanition of famity and the true meaning of home. One of the many things he has learned is how to love. His parent taught him this by letting his family (or close to family) stay at their house. His parent took in all that needed help and they helped them get back on their feet. That is what I think the mood of the story is."
4,"Heartwarming. That is the mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memior Home: The Blueprints of Our lives. Narciso talks of the passionate cuban culture, his welcoming home, and his caring and selfless parents.Narciso starts out the story, describing his home. He explains that it was filled with cuban culture. Food music and all. Narcisco states in paragraph @NUM1 ""My parents both shared a love of cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That description allows the reader to picture the warm culture of his childhood home.Then, Narciso explains that his home was always open to friends family and neighbors. He explains that they were all united because the country was filled with racism. To overcome that, they needed to stick together. Narciso states in paragraph @NUM2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the money people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" That just invites the reader in.Last, Narciso explains his gratitude he has towards his parents. He states in paragraph @NUM3 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrific. I've often told them that what they did was a much more corageous thing that I could have ever done."" His gratitude and love towards his parents just warms the readers heart...Narciso Rodriguez truely and honestly creates a heartwarming mood in his memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our lives. @MONTH1 his message be carried on for centuries."
4,"There are many mixes of emotions and changes of tone and mood during the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez brings on many different parts of his story, from the sad travel his parents took, to the happiness of his realization of family. All of these are played very well into the piece and are woven together.The intro to this story describes the story of his parents coming to the US. This story's mood is sad and depressing. When reading about it you feel the pain they went through and the courage they had. As Narciso Rodriguez states, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" They did all of this so that Narciso would have a better life, and for this, he is extremely grateful. Learning this story brings a dark mood as you not only realize what Narciso Rodriguez's parents went through but also what many other immigrants also go through.There is also the story of family. This sense of family was created after his parents went through their hard times, when Narciso was brought into a world of love and warmth. This brings moods of happiness, caring, and a sense of warmness since you know his parents struggles payed off. He says that he came into a world of generosity and a world that taught him how important family and friends are. He states that, ""these are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of this piece changes from the struggles of the beginning to the realizations of the end."
4,"In his memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm, familial mood. Narciso deep gratitude for his parents' decision to move to the United States has a large effect on the mood. He describes how brave his mother and father must have been to make the life-changing choice, and admits that ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude."" The author understands what a large, positive influence his parents have had on him, and his gratitude for his family contributes to the warm mood of the piece. Narciso's admiration for his family also develops the atmosphere of the memoir. He uses words like selfless and hardworking to describe his family, and tells them of his ""admiration for strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 his descriptions of the feats his parents have accomplished and the hardships they have had to endure, the author conveys his feeling of true admiration for his family to the reader. However, absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir. Narciso uses careful selection of what memories he writes in his memoir, along with the addition of passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close-knit to make the love within his family stand out. Although there were certainly fights within his family, he never mentions them, focusing instead on the underlying bond he felt with his relatives and how the warmth of his kitchen ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Narciso is passionate enough about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the focus of his memoir."
4,"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had. I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story. An example of appreciating his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him. My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4 it states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of how the author's parents left everything to give their kids a great life. And those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir."
4,"Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and greatful mood throughout the memoir. He did this @CAPS1 never premoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped eachother. Fer example in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir."
4,"The mood the author created in the memoir was appreciation. Narciso Rodriguez thank his parents many times for moving to @LOCATION1 and giving up their lives in Cuba to give him a better life. He also thanks them for his childhood. He thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in. When the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents. He tells how even though his community was made up of many races they still lived in friendship and unity. He tells how people always came over to house for dinner and there were many celebrations. He tells of the courage his mother and father had of coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture. He describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives. Narciso describes how his parents had great jobs in Cuba, gave those up, and took any jobs they could find in @LOCATION1. In paragraph six he says how he will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also in that paragraph he says there is no way to express the graditude he feels towards his parents. The last sentence of that paragraph he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" There once again he is thanking his parents. Throughout the memoir he describes his parents like heroes and thanks them for everything they did for him. That is why the mood for this memoir was appreciation"
4,"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, @CAPS1 creates a mood of happiness, love, and caring to portray to the reader the mood of his home when @CAPS1 was growing up. By describing his happy home and loving family and friends Narciso really makes the reader see the mood of the memoir. In the second paragraph, Narciso describes his home. A sense of joy is implied with his mention of Cuban music aromas from the kitchen which @CAPS1 says ""formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 goes on to tell the reader about the loving people that surrounded him throughout his childhood. Narciso explains how in his community, everybody (mostly immagrants who knew each other's struggle) was very close and family ""had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" For example Narciso considered his neighbors Sergio and Edelmira to be his grandparents. All of this combines to make the reader realize the sense of love within families that exists in the memoir. Finally, the way Narciso talks about the sacrifices his parents for him and how @CAPS1 thanks them for it shows how much they care about each other. His parents, Rawedia and @PERSON1, left all that they had and loved in Cuba to make a better life for @PERSON1. In a time when the United States was very racist, it was hard for them to find work even though they deserved better than the work they did get. It was hard for them to do this, and that @CAPS1 recognized that and thanked them for it shows that @CAPS1 really does care about them. Throughout his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of joy and affection."
4,"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in this memoir ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, was a happy and grateful mood. One way Narciso Rodriguez portrays this moodis by describing how his home was. He explains how his parents both know how to cook and how they taught Rodriguez ""their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Rodriguez also talks about how there was always music playing in the kitchen while his parents and him cooked. Therefore, Rodriguez creates a nice mood by telling the reader how fun his house was while he was growing up. Another way the author sets the tone is by the way he describes the environment and apartment he grew up in. Narciso Rodriguez lived in ""a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The landlord's daughter, @CAPS2 would usually have dinner with Rodriguez along with many of his aunts and uncles. Rodriguez creates a happy mood when he does this because he describes how warm and loving his community was. Rodriguez also creates a grateful mood when he talks about his parents. Rodriguez describes his parents as people who ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3) and is very determined and happy. So, Rodriguez creates a grateful mood when he talks about his parents because he says that they always tried to make a better life for him in @LOCATION1. Throughout this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez manages to have a happy and grateful mood all the time."
4,"The mood the author created in the memoir is united, caring, loving and more. The authour is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. A reason why the author created does moods because a home is were a family live's together and were they hold memories together which shows loving. For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together. A second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. For example, ""They come selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life."" Which means her parent werent just caring abalt them but the future for there son. The whole story is based on home and family but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring and unity of one another."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" is appreciative. One example proving that the mood is appreciative is when @PERSON1 mentions her parents. In the text, the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents, for their love, and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they do was a much more courageous, that I could have ever done."" This shows @CAPS1 appreciates what her mom does, because @CAPS1 mentions, how grateful @CAPS1 is to have loving parents like her own. Another example proving that the mood is appreciative is At the end of the story. In the memoir the author states ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote @CAPS4 that @PERSON1 is appreciative, because @CAPS1 said that @CAPS1 will never forget about her house, neighborhood, and how her parents made her feel like @CAPS1 was really at home. Last example proving that the mood is appreciative is when @PERSON1 so talks about friends//family, and how Important they are to her. In the memoir the author stries, ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family/friends are. This quote @CAPS4/that/ @PERSON1 is thankful/appreciative to have friends and family like her own because @CAPS1 describes the demonstration of how important they are to her. These are all the reasons why the mood of this article is appreciative."
4,"The mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad. The examples of how it is happy are the way the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house, ""twenty-one-year-old @PERSON2 and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2-room apartment."" @CAPS1 example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were decorating the appartment to look like a traditional-cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard-working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And the final example is when he mentions that lot's of his family and friends grace their kitchen table more times than not. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and carrers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve. Those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir."
4,"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a mood for the readers. The mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love. There are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love. For example in paragraph two the author talks about the simple apartment that him and his parents lived in as a great place. He does this because he is so thankful to his parents because he loves them. The paragraph says, ""and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 not be a grateful about simple things like cooking, but the Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy for even the little things they did for him. Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily."" This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family. Also, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about them. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso sees what his parents did with their lives as an amazing thing because he loves them so much. When this memoir is read the mood of love is expressed."
4,"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez described their childhood home. The author creates a mood in this memoir.The mood is created by description of the kindness of his neighbors, his gratitude toward his parents, and how his house was turned into a home. The mood is created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors. Narciso talks about his neighbor hood, calling it ""a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Narciso is getting the point across that his community was a warm, loving place, where everyone was friends and there was no conflict. Narciso also talks about his gratitude towards his parents. He says that, ""They came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Here, the mood is set as grateful, since if his parent had not given all that they had had, he would of been in a worse situation in Cuba. Narciso sets the mood by talking about his home. He says that, ""Countless extended family members came and went -- and there was often some one staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This adds to the warmth of his home, giving in a warmer environment.The mood in this memoir is set by @PERSON1' parents' determination, the kindness of his community, and the open arms of his home. All of these thing are the definition of family."
4,"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author."
4,"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the author. The mood is a sense of love, selflessness, caring, helping, and unity. Love is shown throughout this story by Narciso's parents. An example is the quote, ""this struggle would lead them and their children to better times (@CAPS1 @NUM1)"". This shows love because even though the parents have to struggle, they know that in the end it will help their kids. The memoir shows selflessness because the author states of his parents ""they came to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved(@CAPS1 @NUM1)"". This shows selflessness because the parents gave up everything to help their children have a better life. The parents cared very much for the children in trying to help them reach a better life. They also housed extended family in their house until they were able to get back on their feet. Also, the parents helped the family by offering a place to stay. The author states ""my parents always kept their arms in their door open to the many people we considered family. Knowing they would do the same for us (@CAPS1 @NUM3)"". Finally, a factor that creates the mood is unity. The author says ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. (@CAPS1 @NUM4)"" This shows that despite differences, they came together as one. To conclude, the overall mood is a feeling of love, selflessness, caring, helping, and unity which creates warmth in the story. "

The heart of the house was the kitchen and that was where his parents taught him to cook and showed him the passionate Cuban music In the house, ""...the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (@NUM1). Then, @PERSON1 realized that "" 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM2), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem, @CAPS1 the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet @CAPS1, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (@NUM3).

4,"In this excerpt from Narciso Rodriguez's book, home just reading the last sentence: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" reveals the true mood of the memoir. The mood the author gives out in this excerpt is warm, comfort and happiness. In the first @NUM1 or so paragraphs, Rodriguez describes his simple apartment that he first lived in, and how really, it was nothing anyone would consider special. But as the memoir goes on, he talks about how his family and friends is what really turned his little house into a home. His parents created a traditional Cuban home, which mainly consisted of the kitchen and how cuban music, and traditional cooking always went on. What really established a sense of warmth, community and happiness in this memoir is when he talks about how you didn't have to be a blood relative to be considered family, everyone was welcomed into his home. All were immigrants though, hardworking immigrants that created this close-knit community. Everyone's arms were wide open, so to speak.

He and his family, friends, neighbors came together and would always celebrate and have a big party with different cultures (because his neighborhood was full of immigrants).

This represents the love the narrator gives to his parents by he looks up to his parents for what they have done just to give him a better life.

4,"The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting hapiness. You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of hapiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the hapiness and uplifting cheer from the authors endless childhood of home. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

4,"The mood in this memoir is gratefulness. This memoir is basically about how grateful the author is to his parents.The author is grateful to his parents because of their love and sacrifice. The quote, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" From this quote, I can see why the author is grateful. His parents decided to immigrate to give him a better life, at the expense of their families, friends, jobs, and their country.Another reason why the author was grateful was because the author learned that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. In the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. From this snippet, I can tell that the author was grateful for learning the true meaning of family. He learned a ""family"" was a unity of people that helped each other.The reason why the author was grateful was because of their courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" From this quote, I can gather that his parents were grateful. Most people would've given up from the tall and wide barrier in their way. His parents could've given up, but they didn't. I think it's reasonable the authors should be grateful for his parent's courage.In conclusion, I believe the mood of the memoir is gratefulness, because the author's parents have done everything they could to make it easier for him."
4,"?Narciso Rodriguez lived in a Cuban household that also happened to be a wonderful family environment. His parents let in people who weren't even relatives and helped everyone they could. As stated in the article, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense the family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author of this memoir really shows gratitude and happiness for how he was raised. Growing up in this family environment taught him a lot. When Narciso Rodriguez is born, his parents and family were all going from Cuba to New Jersey. They helped everyone and Rodriguez even stated, ""countless extended family members came and went  and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This shows the closeness of family in the household. Rodriguez thus gives off a mood of happiness and generosity of his childhood. "" and for which I am eternally grateful,"" Rodriguez states after explaining his Cuban culture. This then gives a mood of gratitude and happiness because of how much he was thankful for his background. His mother and father's cooking, attitudes, and music all help to this mood of what Rodriguez was grateful for.  This memoir, thus gives off a very positive mood to the story. By the author using parentheses to show extra emotions also added to the mood. Narciso Rodriguez's quote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" really proves how he was grateful and happy about his childhood."
4,"In the memoir, the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez, gave the mood of the text to be happy, joyful, and a good memory to share.

""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrops to life in our warm home"" (paragraph @NUM1).

In other words, the authors mood throughout the text is demonstrated through good memories which creates the feel of happy and warmth in the memoir."
4,"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir. "
4,"There are many immigrants in the @CAPS1. S. A today that have had different moods during their time in the @CAPS1. S. A. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the mood changes a lot throughout the story. The author in a story has mood changes to make the story more intriguing. For example in paragraph @NUM1 lines @NUM2 it states ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The mood there is respect for what the parents had given their son.A mood in a story is how the author is feeling when he is writing a story. For example in paragraph @NUM3 lines @NUM1-4 it states ""They came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved. The mood is unselfishness because the parents are leaving things behind for their kids. The last examples in paragraph @NUM5 lines @NUM6 where it states ""I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood here is love because Narciso loves his parents and what they did for him by giving him a home.

4,"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominantally gratitude.Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents cooking in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"". His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in paragraph @NUM2 ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 and he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" "
4,"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso created a few moods that are very relatable, yet make you think. One mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the beginning to hand because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he loves about his childhood paragraph @NUM1 says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him happy.Narciso also created a mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your home, and what the word 'family' really means. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people-many of whom were not even related. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows thier consideration of family was large, and inspiring.The main mood in this memoir from Narciso is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice."" Narciso's main mood is gratefullness because he is grateful toward everyone & everything that made his life good, and made him what he is now."
4,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful to his parents. An example of what @CAPS1 is grateful for is the culture they passed on to him. In paragraph two, @CAPS1 says that his parents, ""unwittingly passed on to me their culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" @CAPS1 is grateful that these parts of his heritage were passed on to him, and still loves them today. Another example of what @CAPS1 is grateful to his parents for is them coming to the United States. @CAPS1 shows this in paragraph six when @CAPS1 says,""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did  was a much more courageous thing than I could ever have done.  I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly"". @CAPS1 is thankful for all the sacrifices they made and hardships they went through to come to the United States. Finally, one of the things @CAPS1 is most grateful for is the community @CAPS1 grew up in, and the idea of family that @CAPS1 was taught. @CAPS1 says that, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the... demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author feels that @CAPS1 has many things to be grateful to his parents for, and his mood is reflected throughout the article."
4,"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author creates a mood that goes on throughout the memoir, he feels appreciated and grateful. One reason of why he feels like this because of what his parents have done for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" To Narciso his parents mean alot to him and they've done a lot for him as well. Another reason he feels like this is because of his family, he learned the real definition of what a family is. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family.' And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" Not only do his parents mean everything to him but his family does too and he appreciates that. A third reason he feels like this is because of the enviroment who grew up in. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in a country they love. They struggled both personally and financially..."" Without this enviroment it would have been different, and his parents put him in a good one instead of growing up in a poor enviroment, the did what they could. In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez feels appreciated and grateful for everything that has happened."
4,"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez From, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by the auther is all about love and happiness. The memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories. It expresses the authors feelings or love, @CAPS1 the reader feels it to. The author didn't have many material things growing up, or a big house, but there was great memories of love and warmth.The many different memories in the this memoir gave a mood of love and happiness. First of all, it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author lived in a neighborhood with many different cultures, but they put their backgrounds aside and were able to great friends. Also, the memoir says in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents always their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This shows that their family was very inviting. They were always having guests, and loved a lot of people and considered them family.

The author really did a great job of creating a mood of love, and helping the reader feel it."
4,"In the memoir, there were many moods created by the @CAPS1. For example, in @CAPS2 @NUM1 when he says ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and Friendship. I thought that they were in a together mood. They were all as one, like a unity for organization. Also they were all kinds of cultures comming together. Another example I thought about their moods was in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I thought that there was many moods because you have to have a mood to be grateful for what ever you are grateful for. For example, when you say you love someone thats being kind and loving, but there is always a mood for what ever you say or do. Another mood, that I thought was very brave was-that when Narciso Rodriguez said ""My Mother and father had Come to this Country with @PERSON2, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture. They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind there, families, friends and Careers in the Country they love."" I thought that you would have to have a lot of Courage and bravery to speak another language and go to another Country not knowing how to speak it. A lot of the moods today have a lot to do with things other than just people. You always need to have Courage and bravery today."
4,"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits. One trait of the mood is selflessnes and courage. It is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they love."" Would you be able to throw away your life, into an alien world, just so that your children would have a better future? Doing this would take lots of selflessnes and courage. Also, the mood has gratefulness. The author shows this in paragraph @NUM2 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author's gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage for coming over to @LOCATION2 to give him a better future. Finally, unity is found in the mood. It is found in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs else where, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and freindship. It was a close- knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows great unity in their neighborhood because in other parts of the United States, these three races didn't get alond, but in this neighborhood they were unified. In conclusion, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits."
4,"In 'Narciso Rodriguez,' the author creates mood in several ways. The mood created by the author is a warm, happy mood that associates with feelings of family and love. The first place we can see this mood is in paragraph four where the narrator tells us ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that everyone in their community loved each other and help each other, which added to the mood of family and love. The narrator also tells us of his parents that ""they came selflessly, as most immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This shows that the narrator's parents loved him so much that they wanted the absolute best for him no matter where it took them. This shows they feel family is very important to them adding to the mood of family created by the author. The final place this mood can be seen is when the narrator tells us that he would ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and that it was from his parents that he ""learned the real definition of family."" This shows how much he loved and respected his parents which added to the warm, loving mood. In 'Narciso Rodriguez' several things used by the author create a warm mood of family and love."
4,"Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir had said, ""Growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez would change the way a reader would perceive this memoir. It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. @CAPS1 acknowledges the troubles @CAPS1 and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, @CAPS1 learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants.""@CAPS1 understood how to Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and @ORGANIZATION2 struggled personally and financially. @CAPS1 became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. @CAPS1 adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. @CAPS1 appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. @CAPS1 had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds @CAPS1 created with his parents and the refugees amongst them."
4,"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is serious and it shows how grateful the author is to his parents for giving up everything they had in Cuba in order to provide a better life for their children. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" The author also makes readers realize how much love this family has for each other. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" The mood is also very united and the memoir really shows what family truly is in this community. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This memoir really shows readers what it means to be family, and also what home means. The memoir overall had a pleasant mood to it and the author made a very strong end statement to really emphasize his feelings about home. ""It was here where I learned the true definition of family... I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
4,"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of admiration and gratefulness. @CAPS2 the whole excerpt Rodriguez talks about his parents, and their sacrifices @CAPS1 says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life and braving the harsh northern winters and Facing cultural hardships."" This shows that the speaker admires his parents for moving from their home to give him a better life, even though it meant they was more difficult than it was in Cuba @CAPS2 the whole memoir, you can tell that Narciso loves his parents for all they did for him, and the many things they taught him about Family and love.The Narciso Rodriguez also says. ""I will be always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.. for the strenglth and perservearance. I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality the is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family + freinds are.

I thought that the mood of this memoir is bravery and happiness. Narciso talks about what had happened to get him to this part in his life.This memoir provides bravery because Narciso talks about how his parents left everything behind, just for him. For example, In @CAPS1 @NUM1, it says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.""

'In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..' Their family consisted of a variety of people, not necessarily related, but there was always a helping hand for each other in the community in times of trouble. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.""

(@NUM3) The mood of hope is seen here because it is one thing to have a house but one needs love and hope to make it a home. The mood of hope is seen here because it is a line that the author wants the reader to feel that his parents needed hope when they came to the @LOCATION1. The mood that the author creates in this memoir is a hopeful tone."
4,"The @CAPS1 created by the author in this story is a couple different types of moods. One of those moods is a happy and good @CAPS1. One example of this is when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows a good @CAPS1 because it is about loving. Next example of a happy or good @CAPS1 is when the story states ""Countless extended family members came and whent-and there was often someone staying with us temperally until they were able to get back on there feet."" This shows a happy @CAPS1 because they are welcoming people into there family. Another @CAPS1 in the story is sad. One example is when it says ""Could not afford to move into a moddest three room appartment"" This is a sad @CAPS1 because a you always want the best of for people and if there to poor to afford a good place and that is sad. Also it says ""They struggled both personally and financially. This is a sad @CAPS1 because they are haveing trouble getting by. There is more then @NUM1 @CAPS1 in this story, but the most import @CAPS1 I think is loving. A example of loving is when it states ""all thes cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there is showing love. That is the most importand @CAPS1 to know in this story, loving."
4,"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment.. The authors states, "" originally from Cuba could afford to move into a modest apartment I would soon call home"" (@NUM1). This quote shows, that the authors parents wanted to give him a good life. They did this by moving themselves and him to @LOCATION2. Another example occurs when, the author describes what his kitchen ""heart of the house is like and how even though they are New Jersey, their house still feels like cuba. The author says, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@NUM2). This quote demonstrates, that the authors family made sure he still knew what cuba is like. The authors parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (cuba and @LOCATION2). Last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. The author says, "" I learned the real definition of ""family"" I learned there how to love"" (@NUM3). This quote shows, that the author has learned all the important skills in life. Thanks to his family he now knows how to love and treat everyone with respect. Clearly, there are many ways the author created the mood for the excerpt."
4,"The particular mood of the memoir ""@PERSON1"" from Home : The Blueprints of our Lives is inspiring. The author goes on to explain how simple their home is but the mood shows that home is what you make it When it says ""in 1961, I was born into that simple house, situated in a two family, @CAPS1-brick building in the @CAPS2 section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Just from the beginning of the memoir you can see that the author believes that home is what you make it creating the deep, sentimental mood of this piece, so the author believes that the quantity and quality of this house don't make it a home but the people and your interests make it a home. The author mentions his sentimental value of this house and neighborhood and how this was brought about in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""...I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This is a really strong conclusion that just about summarizes the mood of the memoir by saying it was people and the experience of living in this house not it's size or quality of it. In conclusion the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives portrays a strong and inspiring mood."
4,"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionite and full of gratitude."
4,"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a mood for @PERSON1. The mood the author created was something different, but it never seems to go down.As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the definition of ""family"", in the memoir. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen, they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and pround to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her. The mood the author created for Narciso Rodriguez was always proud, happy, but never sad. She had a lot of memories from one home."
4,"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is respectful. First of all, Narciso's parents were very courages. When Narciso talks about his parents, he says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). Narciso gives his parents the respect they deserve by describing their actions as ""such courage."" @CAPS1 of all, Narciso's parents wanted their kids to have a better life. When Narciso explains why his parents came to the United States, he says, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behing their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). When it says ""They came...to give their children a better life"" shows that Narciso's parents love their kids so much, they did what they could to give their kids a better future, which deserves great respect. Finally, Narciso is greatful for what his parents did. When Narciso describes what he feels towards his parents, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM3). When the author says, ""I will always be grateful"" shows that the author is thankful for what his parents did for him and therefore shows respect. All in all, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author is respectful."
4,"The author of this memoir gave the memoir a peaceful mood. This memoir focused mainly on friends and family getting together to celebrate. It made it peaceful because the author gives the reader the feeling that their was nothing to worry about. The author never mentioned any negative activity in the memoir. He just explained how he was very thankful for how his parents raised him and the lessons that his parents taught him. He mentioned how thankful he was for his parents since they were willing to sacrafice things in their lives for the benefit of their children. The author made the reader feel like Narciso was protected in the house he lived in because all his neighbors were so united with each other that they were all friendly to each other so there was nothing to worry about. They all cared for each other so they would protect each other if anythin bad were to happen which gives the memoir a peaceful and worryless mood. The author talks about how his house was simple, warm, humble, and full of his memories which is another reason I think the memoir had a peaceful mood. When you read the memoir, you can see how the author only talked about good things and a worryless life which really gives the memoir a peaceful mood. These are some reasons that show how this memoir has a peaceful mood given by the author who wrote it."
4,"The mood of this memoir is warm and friendly. This is easily recognizable because all of the poem was based on his family and his tightknit community. @PERSON1 five correct @PERSON2 explains everything about his home that made him who he is today. @PERSON2 also explains about his community and the diversity there. He talks about how his neighborhood is mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. It @MONTH1 seem like this would be a tough neighborhood but he specifically says, ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. @PERSON1 also describes what life is like in his house he tells the reader that the ""heart"" of his house as the kitchen. His mother was always in there cooking a traditional Cuban meal. He also says that everyone (his landlord, his surrogate grandparents, his aunts, his cousins, and his extended family) would come to his house for dinner. Another thing is @PERSON1 would always praise his parents throughout the whole story. He would talk about how selfless and kind they were. He thanks them for his success in life. I believe that if it was very brave of @PERSON1's parents to move to the United States, but they did it for their children. @PERSON1 ends the article with a very inspirational quote. It is, ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is the mood @PERSON1 sets for his memoir."
4,"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, the author shows a very strong mood relating to the piece. The emotions used to create the mood include passion, unity, and gratitude.The mood of this memoir has lots of passion. Narciso talks about his family's passion for their Cuban heritage, and how they shared it with him. That was a big component of turning that house into a home, and therefore, part of the mood that Rodriguez wanted to represent. ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... love of cooking... passionate Cuban music..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM1). I also could feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray. "".. the congregation of family and friends..."" The author mentions several times his parents and him were always letting distant relatives stay at the house, and many friends and family came and shared dinner with them. The author even describes his community as a ""... a close-knit community..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM2). Lastly, a sense of gratitude runs along the spine of this piece. The author notes his parents were a huge part of his life, exposing his to his culture, family and friends, and they home. He doesn't even have to write how grateful he is, it is so evident. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (Rodriguez, @NUM3).The author created a mood filled with passion, unity, and gratitude. All of these emotions are evident in the text."
4,"There are many ways to describe the mood created by the author in this memoir. Some ways to describe the mood are grateful, adoring, and the will to presevereThe First way is grateful. The mood created by Rodriguez is grateful because @CAPS1 talks about being grateful for his parents' sacrifice to come over to @LOCATION1 and start a new life. It says in the story ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than @CAPS1 could have ever done.The second way is adoring. The mood is adoring because @CAPS1 grew up in a ""close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants"". @CAPS1 also talks about having family living nearby. @CAPS1 also talks about his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.""The thid way is the will to presevere. This is the  mood because Rodriguez talks about his parents ""having the faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 ""has often told them of his admiration of their strength and preseverance and @CAPS1's thanked them repeatedly.""In closing, there are many ways to describe the mood created by the author in this memoir. Some moods were grateful, adoring, and the will to presevere."
4,"I believe that the mood of this memoir is warmth. Even though the author described some of his parents hardships when they moved here such as having to adjust to the climate, overall there is a feeling of happiness and accomplishment as of making it in america. One piece of evidence I have to support my thesis is when he is explaining his relationship with the people around him. ""despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows his impression of america and how the country gave him a wonderful childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" This shows his devotion to his parents and how he honors the decisions they made to get him a better life. In paragraph @NUM2 it says while talking about their house, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This shows how in moving to america, his parents kept some of the old and welcomed much of the new at the same time. All of these things show how incredibly warm, inviting, and happy (and lucky sometimes) the author's life was."
4,"The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir."
4,"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and emphisization his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations. @CAPS1 talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way. Another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing, showing @CAPS1 kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" @CAPS1 expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and just stating it. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way @CAPS1 talked about the love for his family, and how important being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states @CAPS1 can't thank his parents enough, and if they taught him none of that @CAPS1 would not be who @CAPS1 is as a person today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just adding the love and culture to one's house can turn it into a caring home!"
4,"The mood created by the author's tone in this memoir is appreciation which is displayed in three important places. First, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates the mood of appreciation when talking about how his parents lef cuba. He explains ""they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM1). This description shows the mood of appreciation because it shows the author's parents left ""selflessly"", ""to give their children a better life,"" which implies that his parents @MONTH1 not have wanted to come to @LOCATION1, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway, which clearly creates a mood of appreciation through Narciso's tone. Additionally, the mood of appreciation created when Rodriguez declares ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM2). This informs the reader outright that rodriguez is"" ""greatful to his parents"", which creates the mood of appreciation should through his tone. Finally, the mood of appreciation is created when Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). This statement insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that ""he will never forget"", what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his tone. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the mood of appreciation through his tone in this memoir to his parents."
4,"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content.Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness."
4,"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood that the author created was grateful, couragous, and generosity.First in the memoir, The first mood that the auther created is grateful. The author states that ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull).""

The author states that ""I often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" That means that all the times he had been with his @CAPS1 or his dad they help him though life and difficulty of his education and work.lastly, his final mood was generosity because of all the time he was young. The auther states that ""there is no way to express my spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age. That means his mother allways depened on him to do all the work around the house in the yard. All in all in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our lives. The mood that the author had in the memoir was gratefull, courageous, and generosity."
4,"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a variety of different moods @CAPS2 the memoir. In paragraph two the author tells how much culture was put into his home ""my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 also tells how thankful @CAPS1 is that his parents instilled him a love of cooking and Cuban music. This gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive. In paragraph three the athor tells how  a family has nothing to do with blood relatives. ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS2 out the memoir you really start to see the authors opinion of the definition of home and family.

""My parents always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family..."" The general mood of this is all the moods coming together to creat a generas senseof home and community."
4,"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is portrays a mood of happiness. It is very homey and welcoming. Narciso Rodriguez sets a mood of togetherness and family. First, although he grew up in a ""simple house"" in 1961 his parents were able to create their own Cuban home. In paragraph @NUM1 it describes his house as full of music and good smells from food cooking in the Kitchen. It says in the last sentence of paragraph @NUM1 ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" This goes to show that they had a happy family full of life. Also, through out the memoir it talks about how Narciso's house was always open, and a lot of family always visited, or came to stay with them. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""my parents always keeping their arms and door open,"" Their little house seems very welcoming and inviting.

This family has a cozy home.In the end the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez shows a mood of happiness with the family. It is welcoming and I gives a good sence of a joyful household."
4,"In the @CAPS1 ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there is a relevat and specific infamation created by the author in the memoir about mood. One example in the @CAPS1 about mood is when the auther is describing the portray overall feeling in Narciso's home. ""In 1961, I was born into the simple house situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within it's walls my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aroma of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, famed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". In this long quote the auter shows relevant and specific infamation about mood The quote shows the heritage, which was cuban. It also provides details about the kitchen. Both parents love to cook and brought their cooking skills down to their son. This quote also shows that Narciso enjoyed passionate cuban music, and it also shows the love of the family in there home. That is the mood creatted by the author in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"
4,"When people describe fond family @CAPS1, their tone is not often gruff. In literature, authors set a mood for a peice, so the reader feels involved in the material. In Narciso Rodriguez' memoir, he talks about his family, and there are many moods created. The major mood given off is wamth. The selection causes the reader to feel warm inside. As the author says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the love of family and friends, and the endless celebration that encompasses both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sets a warm feeling as does other details.There is much more in the selection that causes this mood. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how grateful he is to his parents for their ""love and sacrifice"" when they moved to @LOCATION1. He says it was a ""demonstration of just how important friends and family are."" This sets the mood to warmth. One more thing that causes a warm mood is when the author talks about what family means to him, in paragraph @NUM2. He says ""my parents always kept there arms and there door open to the many people we considered family."" This shows the compassion gave two people who weren't even his blood relative, how they treated them right until they got back on there feet. In this selection, the mood of warmth is portrayed by the author. The fond @CAPS1 can do that to a person."
4,"This @CAPS1 shows a lot of different types of moods that oneper son can have towards friends, family, andyour heritage. Narciso Rodriguez explainsthat family is reallyall you need. Hisparents movedfrom Cuba tothe United States sotheir family, especially their kids, could have a good and successful life. Narciso is very grateful that his parents would put their past behind them and their family just sotheir kids could be better people. Whenhis parents firstmoved here they werestruggling both personally and financially. Whenthey camethey went to aneighborhood where there was mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. In this memoir, it talks a great deal about family, ""Growing upin this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" With different typesof heritages sitting around their table. they noticed that it was not just about who gave birth to you, and who istheir siblings and soon, but who helped you out through your life.

4,"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is of happiness, peace, and gratitude. Narciso is thankful for all that his parents had sacrificed and taught him His overall tone in the memoir is translated into a happy and peaceful mood. Narciso writes ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life to our warm home."" The tone in this quote is calm and friendly, as Narciso explains the happiness of his life at home. By saying his house was ""warm"" with celebrations for family and friends, it constructs the peaceful mood of the memoir.     Narciso goes on to explain that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Here, Rodriguez adds to the peaceful mood by speaking of generosity, and care towards family. It is the idea family that fueled his loving childhood. The mood turns to gratitude as Narciso thinks his parents for giving him a better life, though they had to endure difficult jobs and conditions. He expresses that he had ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The concepts of family, love, and generosity Narciso learned from his parents formed the basis of the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir, as well as his life."
4,"The mood created by the author was a happy mood. I think the mood in the memoir is happy for many reasons. One reason is that in paragraph @NUM1 the boy talks about how all of the cultures came together in great friendship. Also how people extended a hand to those in need even though they might not be their own kind. Another reason is in paragraph @NUM2 the boy talks about how his parents let people stay in their home until they got back up on their feet. His parents kept their arms and door open to many people who they consider family who arent necessarily blood related and they know they will do the same for them. Lastly in paragraph @NUM3, @NUM4 and @NUM5 the boy talks about how his parents left the country they loved and their family and friends just for him so he could have a better life. In paragraph @NUM4 the boy talks about how his parents taught him and showed him @NUM7 lessons. Those lessons are ""there is now way to express my gratitude For the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In paragraph @NUM5 the boy talks about how he learned the real definition of ""family"" and how he will never forget that neighborhood and the many things he learned there about how to love."
4,"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood set by Rodriguez is one of gratuity, satisfaction and happiness. Rodriguez is obviously grateful to his parents, @ORGANIZATION1, as evident by this quote from @CAPS1 @NUM1.  ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture.  They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their childen a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  The mood is happy because he is undyingly grateful to his parents, but he also, as shown in @CAPS1 @NUM2, doesn't dwell on sad things, like his parents leaving their country, but instead talks about the happiness of his childhood.  ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble home where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.  It was here where I leaned the real definition of 'family'.  And for this, I will never forget that house or its growing neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood in the excerpt is gratuitous due to his paents, satisfied because of his life, and happy because of his experiences.    "
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."
5,"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"" the creation of the dock meant for dirigibles had many obstacles while trying to be created. Marcia Amidon Lüsted tells the reader what obstacles the builders had to face.To start, one of the obstacles was not enough space within the city to land, New York City had many buildings that took up a great amount of space making the Empire State Building a potential spot to build the landing docks. According to the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" (¶ 6) The giant dirigibles needed a lot of space so landing would be smooth. Al Smith the man who thought of this idea wanted to create the mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION3 so the dirigibles would have somewhere to land, @CAPS1 and allow passengers on and off.Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there was that there would be too much weight on the building frame caused by the dirigible. The Empire State building was not meant for a large amount of weight when the excerpt says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable teather would add stress to the building's frame."" (¶@NUM1) The builders had to have background on the building and foresee the affect that the moor would have on the building. The dirigible's large mast structure was way to much for the building even with the helium and hydrogen making it light enough to fly. The builders had to restructure the building to make it more suitable.Besides all the physical issues that the builders had to face there was a law that forbade ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" (¶ @NUM2) To protect the people who lived in the city the builders had to find a way to make the moor without breaking the law. The builders had to obey they safety call made and so, the whole idea of the moor being created was gone because there was no way to create the more without breaking the law.The excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes how the builders of the empire state building dealt with finding space to potentially land the dirigibles, find away around stress on the building, and obey the law. The obstacles they face factored into the incompletion of the masting moor."
5,"@CAPS1 can be avoided or fixed before they are ever encountered if one looks with a careful and observant eye on the future. The builders of the Empire State Building, in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast, faced many @CAPS1, that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 like safety, practicality, and ""nature itself."" Safety was a big obstacle. Mooring a one-thousand foot floating transportation vehicle to a ""Single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" closing safety concerns for the people in and around the building who might be killed or injured if the building was to be overloaded on stress and collapse. Another safety issue would be the hydrogen used to float the dirigibles, which is ""highly flammable"" and after the tragedy with the Hindenburg in New Jersey being destroyed by fire it was realized that it could have been much worse over ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another safety concern would be for the people exiting the dirigibles while it would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" because the crew couldn't use lead weights as they normally would to stop the blimp because ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" which was ""neither practical nor safe."" It was impractical to spend ""over @NUM1 dollars worth"" on modifications to ""the buildings framework."" Another issue was the ""practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area."" The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" most especially the element of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" which could make the ship swing around the mast, and in an attempt by ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles the captain ""could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" Another concern from the winds was that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell ""in the captain was so fearful of this he ""could not even take his hands off the control levers."" These were the @CAPS1, problems, and issues of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."""
5,"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flamibility of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building because the dirrigible itself to not be able to stay in one place ""Even if the dirrigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.  For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and it's mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct."
5,"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at their building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen over helium, the winds at the top of the building violently changed, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas.First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk that they will burst into flames. This only occurred to the builders when a German blimp Hindenburg caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, many more lives would have been lost. More people would die, which would cause a bigger fiasco.Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship. The front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a high risk of danger, making this idea impractical.Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, nevermind dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law.In conclusion, the three obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas."
5,"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were high wind currents, and an already existing law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas.The first reason dirigibles couldn't dock was because of overly powered wind currents on top of the Empire State Building. It was mentioned in paragraph @NUM1 that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 was being said here was that it would be unsafe for people if the dirigibles were going to dock near the Empire State during violent air currents.The other reason why dirigibles couldn't dock was because of the law saying they were against airships flying to low over urban areas. @CAPS1 this law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area. It was said in paragraph @NUM2 that dirigibles did try to reach the building."" In December 1930 the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Since the dirigible was @CAPS1 big it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings.It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. All because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."
5,"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable.Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, th structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day."
5,"In the piece ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in their attempt in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Three obstacles that faced them were the framework of the building, the type of gas used to make them float, and the wind currents. These were obstacles that made it so that the Empire State Building could ""never fulfill its purpose"".        The first obstacle is the framework of the building, which the piece said would be put under stress by the massive weight of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle for the builders because they wanted to ensure the safety of the people in the building and they did not want the building to collapse. As @CAPS1 points out, this resulted in ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The second obstacle was the type of gas used to make them float, which was highly flammable. Lüsted pointed out an event that happened in New Jersey where a German dirigible by the name of ""Hindenburg"" was set aflame. This was an obstacle because ""if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" there would be serious damages to the city, as well as many other casualties. The third obstacle was the wind current above the area of the building, which were very violent. As stated in the piece ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"", which was highly dangerous. The fact that a huge ship like that was dangling so high above people ""was neither practical nor safe"", as Lüsted said.     So in the building of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles, three of them being: the framework of the building, the gas used in the ships, and the wind currents. These reasons prevented them from fulfilling Al Smith's dream of an amazing moor mast for dirigibles."
5,"The Empire State building- one of New York's, and our country's, greatest and proudest accomplishments, was not just created as a tourist attraction. Rather, it served a purpose; to make way for what seemed to be ""the transportation of the future"", dirigibles. The builders of this stoic monument had no idea that this was going to occur, ""because it was already under construction when the idea was created. They realized they had a whole lot of work to do.The architects know that if the building was to be a boarding spot for these air-bound balloons, they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The builders had reached their first obstacle- a thousand foot long dirigible held in midair by a cable would add stress the the building's frame. The builders needed to modify and strengthen the frame to accommodate the situation.The next roadblock was a new tower. Rather than building a mast without any ornamentation, the builders constructed a glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would light up from inside, with a resian that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The ""rocket-shaped mast"" would have four wings at it's corners, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring alarm.The last obstacle was the extra floor that needed to be constructed. The building would now have to be 102 floors. The 101st floor would have a glassed in observation area, and an open observation area on the 102nd floor, which would double as a boarding area for dirigible passengers.The fate of the mast itself is sad, because dirigibles dwindled out and were superseded by planes for air travel. The realization also hit people that it just wasn't safe to tether thousand foot long, helium filled, steel rockets per se to the top of a inhabited building above one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Regardless, the builders did have to overcome obstacles to make this happen, making them not only patients but pioneers."
5,"The builders and engineers involved in allowing The Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast around one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air faced many obstacles. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the journey in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, However to blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute."
5,"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck."
5,"The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's @CAPS1, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @CAPS2 this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."
5,"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in @ORGANIZATION2. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A German dirigible had recently been destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State building realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred, ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) and by docking dirigibles there, they run the risk that it could happen. Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around. The obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it impossible to dock dirigibles to the moore mast on the building."
5,"Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."
5,"Trying to build the tallest building and becoming the leaders in modern travel in the world was not easy for the people of New York City. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, since there was no room in the building for the dirigibles to land, the builders knew that they had to build a mooring mast in order for dirigibles to anchor for refueling or service, and transporting people off and on. This is idea wasn't easy because it meant that a thousand-foot dirigible, which probably weighted a lot, had to be on top of the building held only by a single cable. Since the cable connected the building and the dirigibles, it meant that a lot of the stress of the dirigible's load would transmit all the way to the foundation of the building. Besides that, since the building was so high up, the wind currents would make the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making it dangerous for the city, so the builders had to made more modifications, more than they had already done before. Also, the builders always had to be remaking modifications all the time because they had to make sure everything fullfill all the requirements, costing them money and time. For example, when they finished and celebrated the framing the entire building, they realized that violent wind currents was now the problem. In transition, after the builders wasted their time and city's money they realized that after doing all the modifications so that the dirigibles could land, it will not happen because of laws against airships flying so low over urban areas, so the builders did a lot of work for nothing basically. Without a doubt, the many modifications that the builders did to the obstacles they faced because of trying to allow dirigibles to dock in the building was worthless."
5,"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plaussible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights the control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of natures problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countrie's blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over and urban area. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equipp [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up."
5,"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, the author Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes how the builders of the Empire State Building faced the obstacles of reinforcing the buildings frame, the hazards of highly flammable hydrogen dirigibles and the treacherous winds above the building when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since the Empire State Building was not originally intended to take on the stress of a thousand foot dirigible moored to its top, the builders had to make additional modifications to the original building plans to compensate. The changes would have to allow ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). Modifying and strengthening the steel frame with sixty thousand additional dollars worth of obstacles for the builders. Even after these changes, the builders could not change the safety hazards dirigibles entailed simply on their own. The danger included how ""most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The builders were faced with problem of a giant dirigible like the Hindenburg blowing up in fire over the dense streets of downtown New York. Finally, nature provided the biggest obstacle by the constantly shifting air currents above the building. The builders knew that ""Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (paragraph @NUM3). The violent winds made it almost impossible for builders to design a way to keep the dirigibles from blowing into the sharp spires of the buildings. The list of obstacles the builders faced, such as reinforcing the buildings frame, the hazards of flammable hydrogen dirigibles and violent winds above the building all contributed to the eventual abandoning of the mooring mast's use, leaving it now as simply a remnant of a past dream."
5,"Although high expectations were concieved for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's fame. As a result, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1). Consequently, architects had to reinforce the buildings framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful and unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that ""the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (paragraph @NUM3). In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly disappeared. As described by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."
5,"Through attempting to mold the Empire State Building into a revolutionary port for dirigibles, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome major architectural challenges, such as constructing a sturdy building frame to support the mast, designing an efficient space for boarding passengers, and also to sculpt an elegant mast appealing to the eye of air travelers across the globe. The first obstacle to hurl over for the constructers of this project that was deemed to redefine the age of transportation was to find a way to build a skyscrapper that could support the weight and pull of a thousand-foot dirigible tied to the mast atop the building without hulling the building over. The engineers of this project, realizing that the pressure from the immense dirigible would be spanned out throughout the building, thus decided to make improvements to the building's steel frame itself to strengthen it for its new docking purpose. Another challenge builders had to face was to plot efficient space to accommodate all the needs of air travel, like areas for baggage, tickets, observation, and boarding. The builders swiftly conquered this work by building one-hundred-two floors equipped with elevators to bring people quickly to their luggage and an extra observation area to effectively double boarding space for passengers. The final artistic challenge for the architects of the Empire State Building was to not only build a mast, but build mast with style. Ready for the challenge, architects beautifully designed a mast in shiny aluminum that would be perched on a sleek stainless steel tower that would glow from within at night. Although the Empire State Building failed at it's desired purpose as a dirigible docking station, the builders of it try to make it a reality to the best of their abilities by solidifying the buildings frame, making comfortable areas for travelers, and carving into an elegant world structure."
5,"During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. @NUM1 ft dirigibles would add stress the buildings framework, therefore causing the architects to modify the framework. This would cost them an extra @MONEY1 for the modifications. The Architects don't know if these modifications will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects also had to worry about @ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of the winds due to violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. @NUM2 was in December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles Attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough to to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."" Airplanes became the future."
5,"It is stated in the article that ""[t]he mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose,"" and that proves to be true. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one obstacle that is faced is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if a dirigible is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore the builders face an obstacle of a safety issue with the dirigibles if one catches on fire in New York. Another important obstacle is that strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building causes the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which causes the dirigibles to not get close enough to the mooring mass. Also the wind creates a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, ""and the dirigible could be punctured which causes a dangerous situation for the captain. To weigh down the dirigible so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights. Though the lead weights lessen the swiveling it is not practical or safe because lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight fell it could be fatal. Lastly, if the dirigible to moor at the Empire State Building it would be breaking an existing law. This law states that airships can not fly to low over urban areas, so it is clear that it is illegal to moor on the Empire State Building. Before this project was started the builders should have researched or accounted for all the obstacles they were going to face."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", author Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety issues, nature, and existing air laws all prevented dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Safety was the ""greatest reason"" that dirigibles could not dock on the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM1, Lüsted mentions that although ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" many foreign countries use it instead of helium to make their dirigibles float. The German dirigible Hindenburg succumbed to flames in New Jersey, and ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as... New York."" Nature was also a big reason that dirigibles could not dock on the building's mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2, Lüsted describes how ""winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" ""Violent air currents"" would make the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" With many pedestrians on the street below, the strong winds made a dangerous to try to weigh down the ship with lead weights. Existing laws were another issue that prevented dirigibles from landing at the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM3, Lüsted writes that airships were not allowed to fly ""too low over urban areas."" Air laws made it illegal for a dirigible to ""ever tie up to the building or even to approach the area."" In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", author Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes how safety issues, the nature of the winds above the building, and existing airship laws were all obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building when they were trying to allow dirigibles to land at its mooring mast."
5,"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws."
5,"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the buildings flat roof. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (p. @NUM1) This would lead to unfathomable complications, the building was just not designed for that amount of weight. Secondly, the use of dirigibles was not all that safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (p. @NUM2) If a dirigible caught fire while docked at the @ORGANIZATION2 thousands of feet above the city, it could cause a lot of destruction. NYC is heavily populated and an accident like that could be catastrophic. Not to mention how difficult it would be to get OUT of the burning building. As we saw from the @NUM1/11 terrorist attacks, escaping a burning building from the @NUM4 floor is no easy task. Thirdly, winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION2 can be very violent. The dirigible would be tethered to the mooring mast, but the back of the ship would be free causing the ship to swivel around the mast. In addition, this dirigible would be high above the streets of @CAPS1 with hundreds of people below. If the dirigible fell, many people could be hurt or killed. The fourth problem the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means dirigibles would not even be allowed to go @CAPS2 the building. It when it was attempted twice to dock dirigibles at the @ORGANIZATION2, it was impossible. The idea was simply abandoned thereafter as a dream proven to be a failure."
5,"There were many legitamate obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first Al Smith, four-term governor of New York who encouraged the plan after his years in office, believed the plan was perfect. Many constructors/architecs involved were blinded to the problems by their excitment. Realization eventually took place when many obstacles came up. The first reason was due to the chemical make up of dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This means that if a fire starts in such a populated area as New York, the accident could be life changing/threatening The greatest obstacle was nature. The wind was held accountable for a majority of the problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible is constantly being pushed around there would be no way to ensure a safe or easy docking. Open fields where a dirigible would not swivel around is much more suitable. Having such a dangerous procedure high above pedestrians on the street would be very foolish and risk safety. The most obvious reason that the builders faced was an existing law. This law stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Clearly this reason alone would be enough to overrule or stop the idea and construction. The stubborn and determined people still tested this mooring mast, but were soon shut down by previous reasons. ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers."" Dirigibles will never be able to dock on the Empire State Building."
5,"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.  The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  For this reason they first had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  In the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all."
5,"In the article, ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced several obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Due to nature and the framework of the building, made it impossible to land a blimp on the building.Nature can be unpredictable, and at 1,250 ft, the height of the Empire State Building, is no different. The extremes of nature make it nearly impossible to @CAPS1 blimp on the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). Due to the harsh winds, the blimp could spin out of control at any time. The ideal of landing the aircraft seemed unethical because of high risks, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). Nature and safty was evaluated and took into consideration that the attempt should not be made.In addition to nature, the addition of a moor mast to the building would cause a number of problems. For example, the structure of the building would not be able to handle the stress, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and to the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM3). The pressure on the building would have been too much and would cause it to be unstable. Despite the stress that it would cause, the building would also have to be modified, ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made..."" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM4). The cost of the modifications was enough to show that landing a blimp was not practical.The variety of obstacles that appeared during the attempt to land the blimp on the Empire State Building was unethical and unrealistic due to safty issues, nature, and the structure of the building."
5,"Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way."
5,"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimbs (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (Lüsted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Lüsted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As Lüsted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful."
5,"Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on.Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire S Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building.On December 1930, U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear. In the late 1930's, the idea disappeared to be replaced by airplanes."
5,"When the builders of the Empire State Building decided to build a mast upon its top where dirigibles could dock, they were faced with many problems @CAPS1 the project to end up a failure. The purpose for building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock there for a few hours to re-fuel and let passengers off. Unfortunately, once construction was completed, the workers realized that this plan wouldn't work for many reasons. One reason why dirigibles wouldn't be able to dock at the top of the building was due to the high winds and the length of the airship. Normally when a dirigibles lands, it's an open landing field and they could be weighed down in back with lead weights. However, when they were up so high, they would be swiveling back and forth making it very dificult to dock up on the building. Also, at such a high height, they cannot be weighed down with lead weights because it's highly dangerous to the pedestrians below. Another obstacle that builders ran into when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was that foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen instead of helium which made them highly flammable. If one of these foreign airships were to explode while docked on the building it could've caused major damage. Finally there was a restriction on airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. With all the risks and laws against this project, the workers and men in charge should have seen that this wasn't going to work before they spent all their money on trying to build it."
5,"The builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles while making an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the loading. They could'nt make the building have a flat roof and if they did, it would have to be big enough for the dirigible. So they come up with an idea to tie it, to the building, but that didnt work either. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building tied by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (@CAPS1). There was no way that that was going to work out. For instance if it was a gusty day with @NUM1 mile an hour winds, the stress of the dirigibles load and the pressure of the wind pressure would be sent all the way down to the buildings foundation which was thousands of feet below. Then the builder designed a stainless steel tower, with an observatory floor. It was then decided that it was too unsafe. They still had a floor for observers though. Anothe problem was that the dirigibles swung around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" (@CAPS1). That was anothe problem because the weights would dangle above the pedestrians heads which wasnt even practical. Lastly the only other thing in there way was a law. There was a laugh saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the drigible to even come close to the building. They attempted and failed and the idea was soon forgotten about. The builders of the empire state building faced an obscure amount of obstacles when it came to the building of the Empire State Building"
5,"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."
5,"In the excerpt The @CAPS1 Mast by @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 the buliders of the empire state building faced many obstacles attempting to allow digradebles to dock there such as safety, nature, and laws.The builders ran into a obsatcle and that was safety.

"
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building it to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that the builders had to face was re-designing the Empire State Building to fit a mooring mast, which would allow dirigibles to anchor on the Empire State Building for several hours. According to @ORGANIZATION2, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's Flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 @NUM2). Marcia @ORGANIZATION2 is absolutely correct also, held by a single cable tether, the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be passed all the way to the building's foundation. Lastly, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made to the building's framework. The second obstacle the builders had to make was safety. Safety was an issue because ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM3 @CAPS1 @NUM4). In Lakehurst, New Jersey on @DATE1, 1937 the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" blew up in a fire. This incident cause the owners of the Empire State Building to realize how bad a fire in downtown New York would be since it is so heavily populated. The @CAPS3's greatest obstacle was nature because the winds on top of the Empire State Building were always changing due to violent air currents so even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back would swivel around the mooring mast. The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there ultimately prevented the builders from allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
5,"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced with how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1). They were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. @NUM2). Reluctantly the builders admitted to the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densley populated city was an all around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4). The impossibility of the plan was realized for there were too many obstacles to face. The builders gave up hope but the moorings still looms atop the Empire State Building as a reminder of what could have been."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Most of these issues were due to the concern of safety, nature's affects, building stability, and existing laws.Safety was a major issue because of the setting of the Empire State Building and the nature of dirigibles. Hydrogen which is highly flammable was used in most dirigibles outside of the United States. If an accident was to ever occur where a dirigible burst into fire while trying to land on the Empire State Building, the densely populated area of downtown New York would be at a high fatality risk. Nature's effects of winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents would also create an obstacle as it would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mass. Dirigibles could also be moored down in the back by lead weights, but if these weights were to dangle above pedestrians on the street, it would cause a safety threat and would also be impractical. In order for a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked at the top of a building, builders would have to find a solution towards dealing with the excessive stress and pressure that would be added to the building's frame. Another obstacle that challenged the builders was the presence of an existing law. This law was ""Against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the Empire State Building or even approach the area.Many of these obstacles restricted the ability derigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Builders began to see that what was once a valid theory has now become impractical."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building. It needed to be changed entirely to accommodate landing dirigibles: ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety. Thousands of lives could have been lost if a dirigible accident occurred in New York City: ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@NUM2). The biggest obstacle by far was the elements. Dirigibles were easily swayed in times of bad weather: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was very unsafe because of the dense population of people in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash. The people behind the construction of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties, therefore the mooring mast was never used."
5,"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, which included safety, nature, and already existing laws. First of all, there had been a huge safety issue with their idea because ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Obviously, if this aircraft had been filled with ""highly flammable"" gas it would be dangerous. Not to mention the fact that if the dirigibles were to be docked on the Empire State Building, the dirigibles filled with hydrogen would be even more of a safety issue because of the densely populated area of downtown New York, which was right below. Secondly, nature had also been a true obstacle to the idea because at such a high height at the top of the building, the winds would be strong and shifting violently. Also, ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). Again, nature would also affect the safety issue. Lastly, the other factor that made executing the idea unrealistic were the existing laws. There was already a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM3). The law of the time would make it impossible for the builders to be able to dock dirigibles to their building. Although stunts with the Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles were attempted, the laws went against this idea. With these three obstacles of safety, nature, and existing laws, the tethering of the dirigibles in the peak of the Empire State Building became almost impossible and the idea slowly disappeared without meeting the expectations."
5,"In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast""by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."
5,"When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building is a mooring mast, he had no idea how obstacles they would face in a attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face."
5,"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the original plan for the Empire State building is revealed. Al Smith, the former governor that headed the project, wanted it to be the tallest building in the world, so he was going to add a mast. But as John Tauranac explained, this mast was meant to ""serve a higher calling""-it was going to be equiped for use as a docking place for dirigibles. But the builders faced many obstacles in trying to accomplish this, some that they didn't even notice until after the building was completed. One of the many obstacles they faced was framework. Docking a dirigible to the top of the building would ""add stress to the building's frame."" This meant that the steel had to be ""modified and strengthened."" This is the only problem the architects were able to find, but in reality there were many more, such as safety. Blimps using hydrogen had the potential of catching on fire, which in turn would fall ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also violent winds would make the back of the blimp ""swing around the mooring mast."" There was also the law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" All of these were potential hazards that would have stopped the building of the mast altogether, which the architects failed to notice. Clearly, the building of the mooring mast was not a well thought out plan. It was more competition and eageness to advance into the future. But safety and reality must always be aplied when chasing dreams, two things there were clearly not in Smith or the architects minds when designing the Empire State Building."
5,"Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building: one obstacle the builders encountered was the fact that when a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add to much stress to the buildings framework because of a combination of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure atop the massive @DATE1 foot structure. To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it. As seen by this paragraph there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
5,"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was installing the mooring mast, the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because the weight of the blimp moored at the top held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would transmit all the way to the building's foundation. The builders would have to modify and strengthen to build to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they faced was the cost, because it would take over sixty thousand dollar's to make the proper modifications to the building's framework. Also safety was another major obstacle, they would have to make people were going to be safe, because Most dirigible from other countrie's used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The area's were densely populated an accident over the city would be much worse. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, but winds on the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back would swivel around. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down by weights, but using these would be dangerous dangling that high above pedestrians. Many obstacles were practical reasons why they couldn't moor at the Empire State Building. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas and make it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. So long these obstacles were faced in attempting to allow docking."
5,"Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes in ""The Mooring Mast"" the many obstacles, like violent weather and prevention laws, the Empire State Building constructors faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. Attempting to create a mooring place on the Empire State Building proved to be more difficult than they had expected. The weather on the top of the Empire State Building and the laws preventing dirigibles from getting too close to buildings were two of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced. Lüsted mentions that the biggest challenge to the use of the mooring mast was ""nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lüsted @NUM1). The designers of the building had to find a way to cancel out these violent air currents or to build the mast in a way to safely load passengers onto a dirigible which proved to be very challenging. Besides the weather, safety laws prevented airships from flying too low over an urban area which would ""make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (Lüsted @NUM2). Dirigibles were not even allowed to come close to the Empire State Building due to safety hazards. If a dirigible caught on fire above New York City, many lives would be lost as the blimp fell on the people below. At the end of ""The Mooring Mast"" Marcia Amidon Lüsted tells the reader that overcoming these obstacles, violent weather and safety laws, was impossible for the builders and today the idea of using the mooring mast for docking dirigibles has disappeared."
5,"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" @CAPS1, the builders were over to overcome this problem. After the building however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for it's full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a density populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the prexisting law against low-flying aircraft. This put an end to Al Smith's dreams."
5,"When coming up with such a drastic plan, the builders of the Empire State Building never knew how many obstacles they would face. Al Smith was not only a far-term governor of New York, but he also was a big voice in the building of the Empire State Building. Knowing that he wanted this building to be the tallest in New York, he was up for the challenge against the Chrysler building, being a height of @NUM1 feet. Smith then realized that he wanted to go above and beyond, announcing that his building would reach the height of @NUM2 feet. Both he and his architects knew this was going to be challenging.After coming up with a whole plan of having a landing spot for dirigibles atop the building, many problems began to arise. One problem that they discovered was that with the attachment of a dirigible to the roof, the stress on the buildings frame would begin to increase. They then had to modify the buildings framework costing them over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle that the architects began to face was the fact that the dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium. Hydrogen was a problem because it is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous a fire could really be. The last problems that they faced was that the wind pressure atop the building was very dangerous, and also because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. After many problems occurred, it was decided that dirigible landing was no fit for the Empire State Building."
5,"Based on the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including the overall structure of the building being affeted by stress from the dirigible, safety issues, and the impact of nature. To start off, the dirigible's weight plus the wind pressure around the building, caused too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented them from becoming a big landing spot for dirigibles."
5,"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3) and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his plan's failed by the end."
5,"The builders that were attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building, had to face many obstacles. First, the girigibles were similar to huge ballons, @CAPS1 they were composed with hydrogen and helium. In the expert it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (pg @NUM1.) @CAPS1, if a dirigible caught on fire while it was stationed near the Empire State building, it may also catch the Empire State Building on fire. Resulting in a hazardous environment for the employees, and passengers.Next, attempting to tie down a dirigibles to a building, is known to be illegal. On the expert it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."". If anyone disobayed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with.Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe. ""The @CAPS2 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted gives an excellent third reason why airships are unsafe, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" If a disaster ever took place, many lifes would have been lost or severely injuried. Finally, the builders and architect would have an extremely hard time convincing high government officials to allw air ships to dock on the empire state building, because the bad certainly over powers the good."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow  dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous affect of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also. This is almost negligence on the builders part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the empire State building seemed innovative and practical, it was irrelevant due to the many obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building."
5,"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. Thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. To suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of New York. Also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" A quote by Al Smith. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the empire state Building"
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of this massive building 1,250 feet in the air. The plan was ideal, for New York City lacked a suitable area to land dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, which could sometimes span to be @NUM1 feet long. However, this plan was far from practical. Just designing the building to hold a mooring mass proved to be both difficult and costly, coming into a grand total of over sixty thousand dollars. It was difficult because of dirigible's load coupled with wind pressure would add stress to the building frame. So much so that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). In addition, once built anyway, the idea of docking dirigibles was not safe. They were highly flammable, due to the hydrogen gas used inside them, as proved by the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in Lakehurst, New Jersey by fire. In a densely populated city like New York, the situation could have been much worse. Also, the air currents would knock around the back of the ship. Although lead weights could be used to prevent this, ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" (para @NUM3). This was extremely unsafe. Not to mention, it was illegal to @CAPS1 airships so low over urban areas anyway. Using the mooring mast on top of the world's largest building to dock dirigibles was neither safe nor practical, causing several obstacles for the workers behind the idea."
5,"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""
5,"Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obsticles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire state building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear."
5,"In this expert The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the narrator tells the story of how the architects of the Empire State Building wanted to build a mooring mast for dirigibles, but were not able to complete this project due to the many obstacles they face. The first obstacle was modifying the steel frame of the building to accommodate such a mast at the top. This, however, was overcome. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made"", but the architects accomplished it. One of the main reasons the mooring mast could not be affixed to the top of the Empire State Building was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is much more flammable than helium, causing the dirigible to be very unsafe. ""The German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey"". The owners of the Empire State Building realized that something of this nature happened in New York, the effects would be much worse. Another obstacle was nature itself. The constantly shifting winds atop the building would make it very difficult for dirigibles to tie up, not to mention once one was tied up, its back and would swing about ""high above pedestrians on the street,"" being ""neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there was an existing law against airships going too low over urban areas. Even if everything else worked out, it would be illegal for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. Although it was a good idea, there were too many obstacles to secure a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building."
5,"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon lüsted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
5,"one of the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constant shifting due to the violent air currents."" This was a huge obstacle because the back of the ship will swivel around. This was also bad because not only its the wind and obstacle, but also the hight is. Or the dirigible was maybe at an lower hight it would'nt be causing all these wind problems. The reason I say this is because the wind swivels the ship around because it is so high up. In my opinion the wind bothers/has more violent air currents at such a high level. one of the other many obstacles was also because the law was practically against it. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". To me this was a major obstacle because maybe the law was scared that an airship might crash into one of the buildings or houses. How ever the main obstacle was finding a landing area. Reason why this was the main obstacle in my idea is because where would the ship leave the people at. The ship cant stay floating above the Empire state Building and let the people get out how they got it. If they would've done that the ship would've sinked down. So to conclude the obstacles that was'nt letting disirigibles dock there was nature (wind), hight, law, and landing area."
5,"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed."
5,"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles while attempting to build an extension on the top, that allowed the docking of dirigibles to take place. Their main issue was safety. Problems that affected the safety were the winds, the law, and the @CAPS1 of the gas inside most dirigibles. The architects hadn't realized how the hazardous air currents would constantly change the winds since this area was so high up, about @NUM1 ft."". In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION4 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to the tie up because of the forceful winds."" (@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 @NUM2) The safety of all the passengers would be in danger if the winds got violent while boarding the ship, considering it was only to be held on by a single rope. Along with the wind, a law also made it harder for the plan to be successful. There was a law stating that it was illegal for airships to fly to low over urban areas. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 @NUM3). The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Empire State Building's owners realized how much more tradgic that accident would have been if it had taken place next to their building. Safety is everyone's concern, when it comes to building. The builders @ORGANIZATION1 threatening wind conditions and legal issues, preventing the plan to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building to work out."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Unfortunately, the builders did not seem to give many of these thoughts during the building process @CAPS1 the dangers of fire and nature, the idea was impractical. Also, the existing airship laws prevented the aircraft from getting too close to the buildings. All of these put together made it near impossible to use the dock.     The first problem they faced was fire. After the dirigible Hindenburg burst into flame in 1937, this became an apparent danger to the constructors. The most prominent danger though was nature. Even on a good day for flying, the winds at the altitude of the Empire State Building made it near impossible to steady a dirigible. Even the lead weights they used would be a danger. If one were to break and fall off, it would go one thousand feet down into pedestrian filled streets. And finally, the laws prohibited airships from getting too low in civilian areas. However even with these problems doesn't mean that they didn't try to accomplish their goal.     Two dirgibles attempted to dock at the Empire State Building. The first of which was Navy dirigible Los Angeles. It attempted the docking, but could not get close enough due to forceful winds. The second was the Goodyear blimp Columbia. As a publicity stunt, they lowered newspapers to an employee there, but did not dock since the landing gear on the tower was not installed. The latter of the two ships shelved the idea of using the mooring mast."
5,"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example, was the architects had to address the potential problem of the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law clearly would prohibit and make it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Dirigibles were designed to be ""moored in open landing fields"" and ""could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Another example, of an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the potential risk to passengers and resident safety. The reason the landing of dirigibles were a potential threat to the entire population of New York City was that ""most dirigibles from outside United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks ""when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the unpredictable winds the dirigible could sway and ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The architects of the Empire State Building were threatened by the possible obstacles of constructing a mooring mast atop the building."
5,"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the safety of the city below, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium"" this is dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable. On May 6, 1937 a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, if this happened over a density populated area it would be very dangerous. By having the dirigibles dock there the builders are taking a big risk. Another obstacle they fail to realize was the high winds at the top of the building. Because the building is so tall the winds are stronger and they ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" To have the dirigible dock would be dangerous and practically impossible because it was not steady. Also the dirigible would still be hovering over the city and if something happened it would be a catastrophic event. The last obstacle they faced were the surrounding buildings. Because the winds were unpredictable, and there were ""sharps spires"" from other buildings there was a large chance the dirigible's Shell could be punctured. Having a docking station in a large city is dangerous not only to the city people, but also to the passengers in the gondola. There are many obstacles with a docking station in a largely populated city, most of them being safety issues. However they are all dangerous and the builders Should have thought before spending money on useless task."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, known more so as blimps, to dock there. The structure of the building was not correct, citizens of New York were endangered by construction and nature itself, were all hardships (just to name a few). First of all, architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored on top the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Therefor, the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Secondly, builders had to recognize the fact that they were endangering innocent @LOCATION1. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but use of these in this situation, where they'd be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not practical or safe. This obstacle also played into the fact that there were laws against low-flying airships. Lastly, nature itself may have been the greatest obstacle in successful use of the mooring mast. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting in violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around. In conclusion, architects and builders faced many obstacles when constructing a dirigible-adjusted Empire State Building. These obstacles were briefly avoided, but in the end, led to the doom of whatever ""higher purpose"" the building was meant to serve."
5,"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock."
5,"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over @MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
5,"A @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the empire state building didn't seem so @CAPS1-@CAPS2 in 1929. Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand foot building, problems quickly presented themselves The first problem architecs ran into was the construction of the building itself. The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable was the Idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are a uncontrolable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel @CAPS1 too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable. A mast was put atop the Empire State building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist. Both of these building's features are out of use, proving to be unsafe to the public."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there resulted from having to design a practical way to create a mooring mast as well as the unsafe height of the landing area. As the roof of the Empire State Building was flat, architects needed to design the structure of the mooring mast that wouldn't put stress on the building's frame once a dirigible landed, so the steelf rame of the building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation (paragraph @NUM1)."" This was challenging for the builders, as they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars towards modifying the building's framework, which was extremely costly. Additionally, at a height of 1,250 feet, the winds on top of the Empire State Building were vicious and violently strong. Due to the dangerous air currents, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around (paragraph @NUM2)."" This was a huge obstacle for the builders because it raised great concern about how to allow dirigibles to dock there without putting the passengers aboard the dirigibles in danger of risking their lives, at such unsafe heights. To conclude, in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the challenges the builders trying to construct docks for dirigibles there, were due to the difficulties faced in creating a simple design and the tall height of the Empire State Building, causing strong, dangerous winds."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there like its length, buildings Foundation, and nature itselfThe @CAPS1 obstacle that they faced was that the dirigible was too long. It's described ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in new York City"" The dirigible was too long and New York was the lack of a suitable landing areaThe second obstacle was the buildings foundation It's described ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" there was a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would have added stress to the buildings frame the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to help the situationThe third obstacle was nature itself. It described ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The wind was constantly shifting due to violent air currents while the dirigible would be tethered to the mast. the back of the ship would swivel around because of how strong the wind was.The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles that they faced were that the dirigibles were too long, the dirigibles were causing stress to the buildings frame, and nature itself. They needed to go through these obstacles and fix them"
5,"In the knowlegde that I have managed to obtain from this excerpt - I have realized the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there by Al Smith's competitiveness and pride in his project and the worries that the building might face while docking and enabling passengers to go on and off the dirigibles into the building. Firstly, Al Smith's pride and competitiveness is demonstrated by ""when he realized he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building, and on @NUM1, he announced that the Empire State would now reached the height of @DATE2 ft"" This exemplifies Al Smith's competitiveness is not wanting to be outworked by someone else. Secondly, the worries by the workers that the building might face while docking and enabling passengers to go in and out of dirigibles into the building shows the fear of the engineers and owners by events like ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" This exemplifies the fear in management of the Empire State building. Briefly, the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced while constructing it are shown in this excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1's pride and competitiveness in his project and the worries that the building would not be able to dock dirigibles and habor passengers."
5,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects of the mooring mast realized a thousand pound blimp moored at the top of the building would add too much stress to the building for it to be safe. They had to spend over @MONEY1 to modify the foundation of the Empire State Building. @PERSON1 and the rest of the building's architectural office discovered many unsolvable obstacles in their way as they approached allowing airships to dock there. Safety was the number one problem. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flamable. When they heard the @CAPS1 dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire they came to the conclusion that out of the country dirigibles were too unsafe to dock there. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. At @DATE1 ft. there are pretty violent, uncontrable winds that would cause the blimps docked there to swivel around the mast.With a populated city underneath of the swiveling blimp, the builders agreed this idea was neither practical nor safe. The last obstacle the builders faced with an existing law that forbade the airships to fly too low to urban areas which made their idea illegal. The mooring mast was a failure and dirigibles soon became out dated. ""Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, have given way to airplanes."" Safety, violent winds, and the law caused the idea of using the mooring mast slowly disappear."
5,"In ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia lusted builders who tried to make it possible for dirigibles or ""blimps"" to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced some problems they didn't account for. These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, safety issues and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building.Having not considered all these things the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for."
5,"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles. The first problem the architects faced was the docked dirigibles placing too much stress on the building. To combat this problem, drastic changes to the building would have to be made. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2) This change was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast, was nature. At this height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would spin and twist around the mass, an unsecure and dangerous aspect. Lastly, as the except claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3, @CAPS2 @NUM4) The moor provided severe risk to the safety of the people of New York. This problem served as a serious problem, thus serving as an obstacle for the builders of the mooring mass. The building's foundations, nature, and safety violations all served as problems for the builders creating the mooring mass."
5,"The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety & practical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building."
5,"The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."
5,"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1). It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the @LOCATION2. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped."
5,"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders had to face many obstacles while constructing the Empire State building to be able to allow drigibles to dock there. The builders had to face many obstacles such as laws @CAPS1 Changes and the building @CAPS2, that was not thought about while the idea was accumulating. After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the empire State building a docking for Dirigibles, the new airships they finally decided to look at the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mask was being designed architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the Empire States building's flat roof."" ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". When the builders were constructing their plan they didnt consider the fact that the load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realize that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas the dirigibles idea wouldnt be as easy to fulfill with all of the obstacles to over come. The obstacles the builders had to face When attempting to dock dirigibles on the empire state building were safety laws, weather and the building @CAPS2."
5,"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encounter while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem that occurred aroused in the designing of the mast when architects realized that stress would be added to the frame of the building. In paragraph @NUM1 it is stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" This statement shows that pressure from the wind shifting from air currents can add major stress on a large building. In order to avoid this, large modifications would have to be made to the frame resulting in the loss of sixty thousand dollars. Also, the gas used in most dirigibles, or blimps, outside of the U.S use hydrogen rather than helium which is more flammable and becomes more dangerous Another problem that occurred was that there was no way to weight down the back of the ship meaning it would swivel continuously around the mooring mast. Safety was another large issue because the dirigibles would hang above many pedestrians just as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""... They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there was an existing law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas and sharp spires of other buildings could puncture the shell of the dirigibles. Overall, many obstacles were present when the builders tried to allow dirigibles to dock."
5,"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there including safety, nature, and existing New York City laws. Some obstacles were easily overcome while others prevented the project from success. In the very beginning, the builders needed a dirigible to both practice docking, and actually ferry passengers. This problem was quickly solved when the @ORGANIZATION2 offered up use of its dirigible Los Angeles. Another obstacle that was quickly overcome was that the structure of the building as planned was too weak to support a dirigible and needed to be reinforced. The builders simply went back to the drawing-board and came back with a better building plan. One obstacle: that was not easily overcome were safety. Most dirigible used Hydrogen gas to stay afloat however, it is very flammable. Were a dirigible to catch fire over New York City, the results would be disastrous. Nature and the high winds around the top of the Empire State building were also a problem. The ship, tossed around in the wind, would put too much pressure on the mast, and the building making it unsafe. This problem could be solved if the airship were weighted down, but weights would pose a safety hazard to pedestrians below. One final problem they faces a New York City law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. The combined insurmountability of these problems shut the airship project down and the Empire State Building became only a pioneer in neight and not modern travel."
5,"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles. Everything they did was all planned right but when it came time to test it, it didn't work. There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles.One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work.The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city @CAPS1 of the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the empire state building would not work."
5,"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there One problem is that if they were to tie a single cable tether to the building & the blimp then it would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the blimps load, and wind pressure had to have been sent all the way to the base of the building which was @DATE1 ft. below. Another problem that aroused later was that other blimps outside the United States were made w/hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flamable. Now since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up by fire over @CAPS1, New Jersey, architectes are now worried that it will be a bad idea to do this b/c if it happened over @LOCATION3 city then many more lives would be in danger. Also yet another obstacle came up due to nature itself. The winds @ the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be all over the place. Thats why now, blimps dock on the ground and are held down by weights on @NUM1 sides. One other reason that this is a problem is that docking a blimp @ the Empire State Building would be illegal due to the case that it is flying to low to the ground. This law also makes it illegal for the blimp to dock on to the building."
5,"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues. As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building."
5,"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete."
5,"The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to @CAPS1 or fly a ship in New York City."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced the obstacles of safety, nature, and law in attempting to dock dirigibles atop the empire state building. First, it would not be safe. In the excerpt it stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In a densely populated area such as New York, they couldn't risk having a dirigible burst into the flames and cause massive chaos. Second, nature would not agree. In the excerpt it stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all. They could've taken risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice. They wouldn't be able to fight the law to allow dirigibles to fly that low. To conclude, the obstacles faced by the builders of safety, nature, and law could not be overcome to get the mast up and working."
5,"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great."
5,"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3 the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. One reason that it was difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was safety issues. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With New York City and its dense population that is a risk that cannot be taken. Another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The start of paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With high winds the dirigible, even tethered to the mast, would swivel around the mooring mast. Another difficulty in docking the dirigibles was according to the excerpt in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to this law it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. A final obstacle the builders faced was the advancement with airplanes and that made it difficult for dirigibles to be the prime source of aeronautical transportation. Even though the builders spent a lot of time and effort in making the Empire State Building a national @CAPS1, which it is, they neglected many potential problems with the mooring mast which led to it never accomplish its full potential."
5,"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three main obstacles were: the weather, public safety, and the law codes. The weather posed a large problem due to the fact that the wind 1,250 feet up in the air ""was constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" (paragraph @NUM1). To keep the dirigibles in one place with the wind, they would have to be kept in place by massive lead weights. That would pose a public safety problem, due to the fact that the weights were over @NUM2 feet of many individuals on the New York streets below. Another factor that would harm the public safety of others is that the dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium. Hydrogen tends to be very flamable, and when a German blimp went down in flames in New Jersey, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" (paragraph @NUM3). Along with the possible dangers, law codes prevented aircraft to fly to low over certain areas. Because of this law, it would be ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area,"" (paragraph @NUM4). The strict laws, along with heavy winds and the concerns for the safety of New York pedestrians, prove to be the main obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
5,"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This displays the fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Next, air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by air currents, so it was difficult for pilots to land. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful as a result of them."
5,"While in the process of building the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles. His first obstacle was the threat of title for worlds tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. (paragraph @NUM1) ""The architecs would add @NUM2 dollers worth of modifications to the framework to allow it to be stable. After the building was able to accomodate dirigibles saftey issues would be encountered. First off, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is extremely flammable. After the disaster in New Jersey they did not want to take a chance. Next, with the wind above the building the air currents would cause violent shifts of the dirigibles. The addition of weights, used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Lastly their is an existing that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. Which this would clearly violat. With all these obstacles to overcome the idea of docking dirigibles on this mast was shortly discarded."
5,"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought."
5,"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world."
5,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire state Building faces several obstacles while trying to get dirigibles to dock there. The weather is one obstacle and another is the law against aircraft speeding too low over city. When they first begin planning the mooring mast docking area for dirigibles, they knew that the front be teathered to the building in the back would swing in the breeze"". They did not, however, plan on winds being so rough that the dirigibles couldn't get close enough to dock. ""wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The captains could lose control of the dirigibles if the winds were that bad, and they would crash or pop. Both of which you wouldn't want to happen over downtown @CAPS1. Which brings me to the next obstacle of laws against airships flying low over city's. This is not safe for many reasons. some dirigibles are filled with highly flammable hydrogen and also the other buildings spires would make it hard to maneuver. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The plan for a dirigible docking area on top of The Empire state Building was a failure by design, it could never have worked and even if it had it would have been illegal. The winds and laws were some obstacles in the building of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building."
6,"@CAPS1! Look out! @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Heres a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. Its unbearable to watch. Ambulences sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And thats @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, Id lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadnt made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, Id still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe its just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldnt know because in no way we we typical. When we arent fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. @CAPS4, @CAPS5 starts, I know I havent been patient with you lately, and for that Im sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing. I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself? @CAPS5 didnt have to explain any farther. @CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around, my voice caught in my throat, just to get my stupid notebook. A single tear weaved its way down my face. @CAPS7, hunny! my mother teared up as @CAPS6. That doesnt make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way! I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. @CAPS8, I said, regaining composure, thats how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8. @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mothers lips. I will wait then. And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect."

6,"Patience is a very important trait  in life, unforunately  some people  @CAPS11t have the ability  to be patient and wait f or long periods of time. I try to be patient whenever. I can, but sometimes  I @CAPS11t do a very  good job. One time I remember that I need to be patient, was the wait for the long wait to get on the @CAPS4 to go home on the first day of school. @CAPS7 was the very first day of seventh grade my first year in middle school. The day was crazy has always. When clock. Finally hit three oclock I was ready to go home. I didnt have any homework so I grabbed my backpack and my trumpet, and then I caught up to my friend @ORGANIZATION1, or  @DATE1. Her long brown hair swished as she walked. When I caught up a smile stretched a cross her crackled face and her sparkling blue eyes light up, @CAPS1 have to go get @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 off of @CAPS4 @NUM1. I nodded my head in response. @CAPS1 rain outside and walked up and down the busing lot. @CAPS4 @NUM1 wasnt there @CAPS1 ran up and down @CAPS7 several times, my trumpet case banged on my leg. @CAPS1 should ask a @CAPS4 driver. I @CAPS5 starting to grow impatient and worried. @CAPS3 down, be patient everything will be fine.  @CAPS4 @NUM1 while be over there. @CAPS5 the @CAPS4 driver pointing to the opposite side, so @CAPS1 ran over there to see @CAPS7 pull in the parking lot and adults were helping the kids off and putting them on there buses. I was annoyed. @CAPS6! I grumbled, unpatiently. @CAPS1 sat down and waited for the, to let us on. @CAPS7 cant be much longer. I told @ORGANIZATION1 after a hour, trying to stay patient. After an hour a high-school girl stomped up nearly stepping on @ORGANIZATION1 and I how where sitting there. @CAPS8 is so stupid! I could be home watching @CAPS9 right now! yelled the high school girl impatiently. I sat there trying to be patient, but @CAPS7 was very boring. Im glad I @CAPS11t have dance tonight, @CAPS7 starts at @NUM4 and @CAPS7 is already @NUM5. @CAPS5 @DATE1 I have soccer tonight at five oclock, and I cant be late, @CAPS7s my very first practice. I @CAPS5 starting to worry. @CAPS11t worry, be patient @CAPS7 is only @NUM6, and you have got forty minutes, Im sure they will be there on time. @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I new I had to be patient, but @CAPS7 was getting very hard after an hour of waiting. There was only @NUM7 minutes to my practice. I was very impatient. Im going to be late! I grumbled. Soon @CAPS7 was only five minutes then @CAPS1 finally made @CAPS7 on and I rushed to get ready and I mad @CAPS7 to my soccer practice on time. Being patient is very important and will make the situation easy without being impatient. Sometimes being patient pays off and you are on time."
6,"Patience is the ability to be tolerant,understanding and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isnt  something they teach you in my school. There isnt a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and its not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really dont understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me.

Im just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if Im able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, Im sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. @CAPS2! I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says open. @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says @CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor. I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to sucsesfully complete  my mission without being  patient."
6,"Little kids, you just got to have them! The way they scream their lungs out just to get a bottle; and your trying to be patient so you dont yell. Whats better than that? I can tell you whats better than that! Not babysitting children thats what! Because if you choose to do so, it might turn out a little something like this. I was quietly watching t.v on @CAPS3 bed when @CAPS3 cell phone rang. I picked it up and took a look @CAPS16 the screen to see who it could be. The screen read mom. I answered while turning the volume on @CAPS3 t.v down. @CAPS1? @CAPS2, listen um. @CAPS7 needs you to baby-sit her @NUM1 kids tonight so Im on @CAPS3 way to get you. @CAPS3 mom replied. @CAPS4 okay im ready, Ill wait out in the driveway. @CAPS5 @CAPS8 be right there, bye. Your probably wondering who @CAPS7 is, shes @CAPS3 moms friend. @CAPS3 mom picked me up and drove me to beths. When we arrived, all three kids came running out screaming @CAPS6! I did a take smile pretending I was happy to be there, while muttering under @CAPS3 breath hey guys. @CAPS7 handed me a list of things to do and not to do. Then quickly said @CAPS8 and before you knew it she was gone. @CAPS3 mom followed out of the driveway right behind her. I knew this was gonna be hard because the kids aged are @NUM4,@NUM1,& @NUM3. Two boys and a girl. @CAPS10 is the girl shes @NUM4, @CAPS9 is a boy @NUM1, and @PERSON1 is @NUM3 also a boy. We go inside and they all walk in the toy room. I sitin the livingroom and watch t.v. Pretty soon I hear a loud scream. I run in the room to find @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 pushing @CAPS10 on the floor and throwing toys @CAPS16 her! I grab the two boys and put them in their own bedrooms. Then I go and get @CAPS10 a blanket and I rock her sleep. Soon enough, its lunch time. I let @CAPS10 sleep during lunch. I look @CAPS16 the list @CAPS7 left for me. For lunch it says @CAPS13.

In the car @CAPS3 mom asks what did you do? I just smiled and said @CAPS16 least I was patient! thats all that matters!"
6,One time my @CAPS3 planned a fishing trip to @LOCATION1. @CAPS8 @CAPS1t know. He told me to pack my suit case for three days worth of clothes I said why he said we are going to @LOCATION1 tomorrow with your causins @PERSON1 and ryan. I was so excited that I flew to my room and pounded cloths in my @CAPS2 and looked through everything I would need. I asked my @CAPS3 what we were doing there he said were going on a fishing trip in the @CAPS4 river for pike. The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin real. So I got my fishing poles ready packed my @CAPS7 and went to sleep so I could get up early. @NUM1 am come and my alarm went off I was so tierd I could barely see @CAPS8 we had to be at my uncles house at @NUM2 so I had to get ready. Once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car @CAPS8 I couldnt once we got in @LOCATION1 it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even sas a bear @CAPS10 a river that we stopped at then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole withe millions of frog in it. When we finally got there my @CAPS3 made me wait and unpack. Once me and my causin got @CAPS12 unpacking we went right to the store to fish my first cast I caught a little @NUM3 incher on a @ORGANIZATION1. After that we caught nothing so we came back up when it got @CAPS13 and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake @CAPS10 the @LOCATION3 we caught nothing. That night we went fishing on the @CAPS4 river and we still caught nothing. The guy that owned the cabin said we should cath @NUM4 or @NUM5 pike a @CAPS5 @CAPS8 it had rained seven feet so they wernt feeding. The next @CAPS5 we got up early again and fished all @CAPS5. In the morning I had one hit we had nothing afterward. At lunch we found a little @LOCATION2 to eat lunch on it had a actual rock cave and we had scared a bear off the @LOCATION2. Later we went to this little canyon that was really hard to clime I almost fell halfway @CAPS19 @CAPS8 I got looked on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we video taped and we killed a chipmunk with a @CAPS21 rock that we threw @CAPS19. Wham it almost took my pole I fought it for about ten minutes I waited and waited it was a digantic pike @CAPS8 it shapped my line and I still have never seen that pike.
6,"I work up on a cold @DATE1 @TIME1. The snow had been falling all night in a thick blanket. @CAPS5 was very early in the @TIME1 about @NUM1 am. Today was the day for @CAPS9 doctors appointment. I was going to get shots. Ive never liked shots, the thought of having a long needle striking @CAPS9 arun scared me. I got out of bed and got dressed, I took @CAPS9 time hoping to @CAPS8 late and not getting them. Once I was done I heard @CAPS9 mom yell from the other room. (mom its time to go. @CAPS1 peeped her head around the corner and looked at me. I signed and grabbed @CAPS9 coat as I followed her out to the car. I pulled @CAPS9 self into the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @DATE2. I backed @CAPS9 self in as I sat back. @CAPS9 mom came into the car and holding her thermos of coffee. @CAPS1 started the car and put @CAPS5 into @CAPS4. I looked out the window and signed once more, @CAPS9 breath forming a grey cloud. I felt a haud on @CAPS9 shoulder and looked up. @CAPS9 mom was smiling down at me. @CAPS5ll @CAPS8 fine, @CAPS5 wont hurt a bit and @CAPS5s very quirle. @CAPS1 started plastering a bigger smile. I half heartedly smiled back before turning back to the window. @CAPS5 didnt take long for us to arrive. We packed and hopped out of the car. @CAPS9 mom put her hand on @CAPS9 shoulder as we walked to the door that had the word @CAPS6 in plain letters.i took in deep breath as I stepped inside.  I crumbled @CAPS9 nose at the horrid smell, the fumes of rubbing alcohol and rubber gloves. I tried holding @CAPS9 breath as we walked to the administrator. @CAPS9 mother talked to the person at the front desk filled out some forms and came back. We sat in the dull colored waiting room. Thats when I heard the dredful call. @LOCATION1? There is a mom for you. @CAPS7 a young woman holding a clipboard. @CAPS9 mom stood up and I did the same behind her. We walked into the room and sat. @CAPS9 paitents was slowly becoming non existentan as @CAPS5 had already been @NUM2 minutes. I started getting grumpy. @CAPS8 patient! @CAPS9 mom scolded me. I grumbled angerly as I waited for the shots. I wanted them to @CAPS8 over with. Almost on que the doctors wolked in holding a needle. @CAPS10, I proclaimed, @CAPS1 smiled. @CAPS11 for the wait. The doctor stated. @CAPS9 mom responed with some joke about @CAPS9 paitents .The doctor laughed as @CAPS1 took the needle. @CAPS1 took @CAPS9 arm, I closed @CAPS9 eyes and felt the prick. @CAPS5 wasnt so bad. I opened them. @CAPS12 wasnt so bad! Just remember to @CAPS8 patient. I smiled at the doctor. I will take her in consideration."
6,"During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didnt know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didnt know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didnt say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who dont know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes wont go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since Im not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didnt once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didnt yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldnt have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I wouldve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. Im amazed at my moms understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too."
6,"Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear @CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2. so I got up and checked it @NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from at @NUM2 all from @CAPS6 dad. I felt something was wrong. I called him back and I hear @CAPS1 get ready grandm @CAPS4 I coming to get you. I said it`s @NUM3 @CAPS5 are you nuts? at this time I was at a family members house @CAPS8 @CAPS6 dad said @PERSON2 was in a bad crush. @CAPS6 heart drop and I started crying. get your stuff together and I will call you back with more info. I got off phone @CAPS6 aunt was up she came into the room I told her what I knew. I was getting @CAPS6 stuff together try not ta wake anyone else up. When I was waiting for the call everything went through @CAPS6 mind. I was with him, what happened, is be ok is he going to die? @CAPS8 I heard beep beep I said good bye and ran out. Running made me think of more like: how bad is he hurt, what was he driving, what was he doing out? I got in the car I questioned @CAPS6 grandma asking her where is mom, where is @LOCATION1, where is @CAPS7 are they ok: when will I see him? All I knew in had to be patience. @CAPS8 I got the call I asked @CAPS6 dad what happen what did he hit, who called @NUM4, where do we go? the first thing that came out of @CAPS6 dads mouth was calm down I can`t come home but @PERSON1 will be there I want you to stay with him ok yes dad I will and dad I said you he said back. I said I love you. I love you too he said. The worst time for @CAPS6 life was waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were @CAPS6 dads when @CAPS6 dad wasn`t home. I know I would be fine with @PERSON1. How will be act seeing his bestfriend like that? @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are fire men I wonder if they knew who helped @PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hand to do but I had to be patience. I remember closing @CAPS6 eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I get to go in @PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem all the glass on him @CAPS8 dayna said look who is here he opened his eyes they got really big when seen me. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said @PERSON1 come here @PERSON1 went. @PERSON2 said thank you for taking care of @CAPS6 little sister I love you man. That is the time in @CAPS6 life I had to be patience to see @CAPS6 brother. I didnt care how he looked as long as he is ok."
6,"The wind in my face, complete silence until the sounds of the car horn and my moms voice yelping, @CAPS1 are in @LOCATION4! @CAPS2 and a half more boring hours until I was in paradise, the sunshine state, @LOCATION5. Warm weather, beaches warling for me. To think @DATE1 morning my journey began in @LOCATION1 at @TIME1. It all started @CAPS6 a cool, crisp, damp morning for my mom and I packing for a tremendous drive. Nearly @NUM1 miles to drive. Thoughts racing through my head at the moment. Ive done @DATE1 I thought, I can do it again. The trunk door slammed shut it was time. Begining my journey to @LOCATION5 starts with @LOCATION7. @LOCATION7, the most boring pat of the drive, nothing exciting to see along the way. Nothing to look forward to, I knew I had to be patient. @DATE1 time of time of year was the best and the worst. Best because I was going on vacation and the worst because I knew how long @DATE1 would take but it was totally worth it. Towards the end of @LOCATION7, @CAPS1 saw where the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 played there home games. Ten minutes later @CAPS1 entered the state of @LOCATION2. @LOCATION2, the second most boring part of my trip. Actually it wasnt that boring because my mom and I drove along the side of a mountain. Rigid, rough I could smell the trees out the window. I havent been @DATE1 close to nature since the fourth grade. The mountain looked rougher than sandpaper. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 were driving, I head a horn, right then was a sign saying, @CAPS5 to @LOCATION3. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 entered @LOCATION3 the mountain range started getting smaller and smaller @CAPS6 the car drove farther down the road. Another thought came through my mind, @DATE1 states down, @DATE1 and a half to go. I asked to turn on the radio. @CAPS6 the song started playing, I noticed @CAPS1 were in the home of country music. Well Im sure my mom had the same thought and turned it off in a flesh. The radio didnt last long and neither did @LOCATION3 because I looked up and saw the border sign. The wind in my face, complete silence until the sounds of the car horn and my moms voice yel, oing, @CAPS1 are in @LOCATION4! @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite and least favorite states to drive through, for one reason. Its one of my favorites because I like to watch the airplanes fly overhead. I dont like it because it seems to take the longest to drive through. The scenary of @LOCATION6 is so different from the others. It has a more city look than the other places. I managed to loop my patience the whole time. It payed off because @CAPS1 arrived in paradise."
6,"Once upon a time there was a preeteen name lola @CAPS1 lived in a land called wounder land and lola was a single queen @CAPS1 had lots of money and food and @CAPS1 had a big house but there was one thing that lola was missing @CAPS3 was a preteen prince there were lots of boys thowing themselves at her but not one of the cute strong preteen boys was the one for her. So one day @CAPS1 wanted to go to the village and see all her people and they were very happy to see her they yelling her name llola lolal and telling her that is was the best queen they ever had. Then after they stop yelling her name @CAPS1 saw a cute and strong preteen prince and has name was @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 fell in love and went over there and said hello and he said @CAPS4. Then @CAPS1 said do you want to come to my place and have diner and he said yes. Were do you live and @CAPS1 said in the big place he said ok see you at six. He did not know @CAPS1 was a queen so he went to the place and they at carb legs then after diner they played veido games afer that they started to like each other. Then a month later the were boyfriend and girlfriend everything was going good. @CAPS1 wanted him to ask her to marrie her but @CAPS1 had to wait patiently and @CAPS1 did @CAPS1 waited a year and he still did not ask her to marrie him. @CAPS1 new that if @CAPS1 ask him @CAPS3 would not work out so @CAPS1 wait and @CAPS1 waited some more and he tell didnt ask her so the next day @CAPS1 went out with her friends @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, feanne and @CAPS5 and they went to the @CAPS6 and they sat in the mud bath and they were talking about how @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 were doing and @LOCATION2 said they were doing good. @CAPS3 is just wont ask me to marrie him I dont think he wants to ask me but we liveing together. The next day @CAPS1 @CAPS1 came home and all her friend and family were in her house and in front of everyone he ask her to marrie him and @CAPS1 said yes and everyone was happy for her and he said I was going to ask you I just wanted @CAPS3 be one you will never forget and @CAPS1 ask her friends if they knew and they said yes everyone knew we just couldnt tell you. A year they had a big wedding @CAPS3 was so perty and @CAPS3 was the wedding of the village and everyone was there and they partyed all night. The @CAPS7."
6,"The time when I was patient was when I was @NUM1. And I was geting a new dog her name was going to be lola. When my mom came home withe the news that we were getting a new dog I was so happy but then @CAPS2 told us that @CAPS2 was just born and that @CAPS2 could not be taken away from her mother right @CAPS5. I was so sad that we could not have my dog yet and so I marched to my room and stayed there.Later that night my mom came into my roomYou @CAPS3? @CAPS2 said in the safest tone y im fine, just why cant we get lola @CAPS5? I said lola is not old enough to eave her mom yet, @CAPS2 needs her mom because we are not dogs and we cant take care of lola when @CAPS2 is a pupy pluse @CAPS2 only fits in the palm of your hand to so it would be had to see her too. @CAPS1 but we could put her in a box with a race blanked. @CAPS2 would probably get sick you will just half to be pacient @CAPS3, @CAPS3 I said sadly  @CAPS5 go to bed. A few weeks past and mame came home with good news @CAPS2 said that we can go see lola I was so happy but yet still did not under stand that we could not see lola yet as we got in the car and drove to the house that own the new dog was living at a was thinking of nothing but my new dog lola. When we got there I juped out of the car with exitment and ran to the house as my mom and dad walked into the door I could see tha pack of puppys lespng there as my mom said it was @CAPS3 to hold lola I was so happy. as my mom picked her upand put her in my hands @CAPS2 was so small and still I enjoy the few seconds that @CAPS2 was in my hands but then @CAPS2 took her and past her to my brother and sister then mum said we half to go and we would be back in a few more weeksAfter @NUM1 weeks gone by it was time to get lola I was so happy. As my mom whent to get her we had to stay home until we heard the door open and in came a puppy jumping around like a rabbit me and my family just woched her as @CAPS2 got yoused to the home some @CAPS2 was laying down on the couch biting my hand and playng with her @CAPS6.And that is the time I had ti be patient in order to get my new puppy lola."
6,"What holiday includes the most patience?? Vote for @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is bugiest time of the @CAPS5 and includes the most patience. For starters children wait all @CAPS5 long for @CAPS1 to arrive! I know I did when I was little! They enjoy @CAPS1 and then there new toys keep them occupied for a month or so and they can't wait for @CAPS1 to arrive again.. Next @CAPS5!  Second how long do you think you spend waiting to check out of a store? Let's just say a long time! You probably spend at least @NUM1 hours total in check out lines. Now if you ask me. You must have a lot of patience in order to do that! People love receiving presents because it's a lot of fun but it really shouldn't take that long to check out. Unless you bought all your gifts at the same store, but I highly doubt it! Also, how long did you take finding what you think a friend/family member needs/wants? Or even deciding what present to choose! I think that people spend way too much time on presents. Then after you buy the present you have to warp every single one! That takes @CAPS6! Third oh the gorgeous decorations! I love seeing the decorations. Houses all lit up and into the @CAPS1 spirit. I love it! Although, it makes me wonder how long did it take to put them up?? And how long will you spend taking all the decorations down? Don't you wonder too?  Forth, is all the @CAPS1 parties. I love getting together and seeing family at @CAPS1 but the drives are sometimes ridiculously long! I'll bet that at least one person in your family has to take along drive to get your family gathering. I know that is the case in my family! Not that it is a bad thing but it is another thing about @CAPS1 that takes patience. Fifth, is going to be.. all the patience on @CAPS1 day!! How many sibling do you have? I have @NUM2. Sometimes it feels like it takes almost @CAPS6 to get your turn opening your presents. Even if each sibling takes turns getting a present it still takes a long time to finish opening them all, but in the end it's normall worth it! Although, it isn't worth it if you got all clothed.... oh well! Lastly, is the @CAPS1 food. At all your family gatherings and even sometimes in your house on @CAPS1 morning, the food lines also can take a white! Especially if you are starving! In conclusion, @CAPS1 time definitely requires the most patience. Don't get me wrong, I love @CAPS1 but it does take a lot of patience to prepare in the end it is always worth it!"
6,"Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and youd have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an epicfail. But I still live. Playing the piece isnt so bad, its just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I dont have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says Im going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. Im not really looking forward to this years @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping Im not going to get any homework. But if I do, Ill just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. Ill have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly."
6,"Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed @CAPS3 is going to have babiesthen I scremed with her. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now I told my sister, @DATE1 . I wouldn`t doubt it, said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright. I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!"
6,"My @CAPS7 always told me to be patient, and I will be rewarded. But I never knew being patient was so hand. Going to the @ORGANIZATION1 taught me how to be patient but while having fun. @CAPS18 all started on a @CAPS1 @DATE1 in @DATE2. My friend and I pulled up to the parking lot of the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS13 got out of the car. @CAPS13 looked around. Bright rainbow near lights, @CAPS2, and lots of fun rides. There was only one problem @CAPS3 at all these people! I exclaimed. A lot of people mean big lines. @CAPS4 @NUM1 hollered back. @CAPS13 squeezed our way to the ticket booth. @CAPS5 up my @CAPS7 said, @CAPS13 @CAPS15 her catch up, bought a wristband, and raced to the rides. @CAPS6 you later @CAPS7 I exclaimed. She nodded in approval then @CAPS13 were gone like the wind. @CAPS13 raced to the @LOCATION1, the host fun ride there. Of course there was a huge line! @CAPS8 I screamed, as I stomped my foot into the grass. @CAPS9 longest line of people in the world. @CAPS10, @LOCATION2 said a bit irritated, @CAPS11 been an hour and were not even half way there. @CAPS12 you crazy nut I said with a grin. @CAPS13 have been here for ten minutes. @CAPS10, this is taking forever she said a down, @LOCATION2 simply replied. @CAPS15s just be patient, @CAPS10, @CAPS19 I initially agreed. So there @CAPS13 were. At the end of the little bit more @CAPS9. @CAPS11 gona be okay! I excloxal  wile, checking my phone. @CAPS18s only been ten minuts, and were already half way there! ten more minuts passed, and @CAPS13 were still were @CAPS13 were ten minutes ago. @CAPS19 I have an idea! @CAPS13 can play a hand game! I said @CAPS20 idea! @LOCATION2 said, That will pass the time so @CAPS13 kept playing slides, slaps, and lemonade. Then @CAPS13 danced in the line to the @CAPS2 playing on the speaker. Then before @CAPS13 knew @CAPS18, @CAPS13 were next in line! @CAPS13 got onto the platform, got into the cart, and prepared for ultimate dizzyness! @NUM2 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 blast off!. @CAPS13 shouted. As the cart started spinning. @CAPS21! I said as @CAPS13 got off the ride. Everything was spinning! By the time @CAPS13 got off, the @ORGANIZATION1 was starting to clear up. @CAPS13 went on the other rides while doing the same concept of our first time in line. After going on the mega drop, @CAPS13 had to go. @CAPS13 said goodbye to the @ORGANIZATION1 and drove on. @CAPS18 looked prettier at night then my @CAPS7 droped us off at @CAPS22 house and I said @CAPS23 @CAPS7 for teaching me how to be patient."
6,"Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when its the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasnt back yet I didnt know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didnt belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. @CAPS3! I shouted, I dont have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  @NUM1 minets till midnight @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me Thats impossible I told her. You can make it. @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasnt that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. @CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen how is it going to end @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. @CAPS9 was that wait really that bad @CAPS10 asked. I guess not I answerd sheepishly. Being patient payed off @CAPS10 lectured. I didnt reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that Im a little better at being patient things will be a lot better."
6,"This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For bragging rigts,we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didnt play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like its the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadnt played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, can you do it?I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!"
6,"One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said @CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later? I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didnt seem like much. When we got into the store thats when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said @CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients? Ill try. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said @CAPS4 you for your patients. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said Do you see what happens if you be patient? I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient."
6,"@CAPS1 on @CAPS8 I said @CAPS2 are going to be late.@CAPS3 was @CAPS23 first time going to leader point and I really wanted to ride the wild cat. @CAPS4, @CAPS4 @CAPS10 said, leader point doesnt close for another @NUM1 hours anyway and @CAPS3 only takes @NUM2 minutes to get there. @CAPS6 go in the car. @CAPS7 @CAPS12 burry up there will be long lines! I yelled as I was running out the door. I went to the car and opened the door and climbed in. I waited a few minutes for @CAPS23 mum to @CAPS1 outside. @NUM3 minutes later I was still waiting. I went back in the house to see if @CAPS23 @CAPS8 was @CAPS7. @CAPS8! I @CAPS20, @CAPS8! Im over here real ax! @CAPS10 yelled back. @CAPS11 is taking you so long? I asked, I have to finish buying the tickets.  @CAPS12 @CAPS8 I whined @CAPS13t @CAPS2 @CAPS6 buy them there?  @CAPS2 could, @CAPS10 said, @CAPS6 be patient.  @CAPS12 this all ways happens I combined. I went back outside to wait. A few minutes later @CAPS10 came out. @CAPS18 I said a little yawn. @CAPS2 went in the car and drove to leader point. When @CAPS2 arrived I ran to the wild cat ride @CAPS12 only to find a line. I looked to @CAPS23 right where the line time was. I told @CAPS27 long @CAPS3 would take to ride the wild cat. @CAPS11! I @CAPS20, @NUM4 hour!  @CAPS21 realax, @CAPS23 @CAPS8 came up and patted @CAPS23 back; you @CAPS13 wait.  @CAPS22 I @CAPS13t @CAPS11 am I supposed to do for @NUM4 hour?  You could stand here and be patient.  I dont think so,I said  I m  going to get same food  will you stay in line for me?  @CAPS23 @CAPS8 signed and said @CAPS7, @CAPS1 back soon. I went to a food place and ate some fries. I thought about @CAPS27 much time I had to kill, I @CAPS6 went back to the ride instead of honging out when I was at the wild cat I still had @NUM2 minutes left before @CAPS3 was @CAPS23 turn, @CAPS24 @CAPS8 , I said  @CAPS21 @CAPS24 honey , @CAPS10 replied. I saw that @CAPS10 was a bit sleepy. @CAPS3 felt like forever @CAPS27 much longer? I asked @NUM7 minutes @CAPS10 said a bit angry. @CAPS6 be patient patient, patient, patient thats all you ever say. @CAPS10 shrugged and said nothing. After minutes of waiting @CAPS2 went on the ride and when @CAPS2 were off. That took forever are get home o bay!  @CAPS6 be patient. I teased @CAPS2 smilled at each other and laughed."
6,"@CAPS1, class, @CAPS3 teacher said, passing out a stack of papers, @CAPS2 will be taking a test. @CAPS3 palms began to sweat. A test? Had I remembered to study? I started at the paper in front of me, looking at the first equation. @NUM1   I bit @CAPS3 lip, scribbling down an answer. @CAPS6 took the whole hour to get the test done. @CAPS4, @PERSON2, @CAPS3 best friend, @PERSON3 said as @CAPS2 jogged home. His breath came out in quick while cloud spurts. That test took you forever! @CAPS6 was hard, I pointed out looking both ways before crossing the street. @PERSON3 shrugged. @CAPS7 for me @CAPS6 wasnt. I stared at him, stopping abruptly. @CAPS8, @MONTH1 be slow and steady wins the race. I retorted before speeding up and dashing to @CAPS3 door step: @PERSON2, wait! @CAPS9 huffed, coming to a stop beside me. I dug in @CAPS3 pockets for @CAPS3 house key. @CAPS10 youre going to do or say, make @CAPS6 fast, I told  him, fishing out @CAPS3 house key.  @CAPS11 me at the basketball courts at four! @CAPS9 blurted. I unlocked the door and stopped inside. @CAPS12t be late, I said, flashing him a grin. An hour later I checked @CAPS3 watch. @TIME2, @CAPS6 read. I threw on @CAPS3 jacket and raced towards the basketball courts, barely remembering to lock the door behind me. When I arrived I beamed at no one in particular. @TIME1, @CAPS3 watch read. Where is @PERSON3? I wondered absently, then shrugged, picking up a basketball that was sitting in the center of the court. If I had to wait for @PERSON3, I was at least going to shoot hoops. @CAPS9 could join me when @CAPS9 got here. About ten minutes later @CAPS3 old boyfriend, @PERSON1, arrived @CAPS13, @CAPS9 mumbled, ducking his head to avoid @CAPS3 keen gaze, thats @CAPS3 ball. I tossed @CAPS6 at him and sat on the sidelines, hoping @PERSON3 would remember to bring a ball when @CAPS9 came.  I curled up on the bench, shifting to get into a more comfortable position. @CAPS3 toes itched I took off @CAPS3 shoes to scratch them. Bleep! Bleep! I sat up and shivered, realizing I was almost. Frozen because of the cold. What time was @CAPS6, anyways? @NUM2., @CAPS3 watch @NUM3? Did @PERSON3 come? I guessed I had fallen asleep. @CAPS14,  a familiar voice said. @PERSON3! I shrieked. Tackling him to the ground. You were pretty patient, @CAPS9 admitted, looking  around at the deserted basketball court. I blushed, @CAPS7 willing to tell him that I hadnt been patient at all. I had just fallen asleep."
6,"@CAPS3 could hear the water rush by @CAPS7 ears as @CAPS3 made @CAPS7 way to the other side of the pool. Just a far more kicks and â¦ @CAPS1!! @CAPS3 had done it! @CAPS3 had won the race, and now @CAPS3 will be moved up to the level @NUM1 swim class! @CAPS5 that means that now @CAPS3 will have to learn how to dive. @CAPS3 was thrilled! The day had finally come. It was a beautiful day the weather was perfect for diving and swimming. @CAPS3 went into the locker room to change into @CAPS7 bright pocad of bathing suit. @CAPS3 pulled @CAPS7 ponytail into @CAPS7 swim cap, grabbed @CAPS7 goggles and went out. @CAPS7 mom had hired a private diving coach @CAPS6 @CAPS3 would be ready. @CAPS3 looked up at the high dive and felt a sudden rush of terror. Then @CAPS3 heard @CAPS7 coach, @PERSON1, say âyou must be @CAPS2. I am @PERSON1 @CAPS5 you can call me @PERSON1! I can see you looking at the high dive. Donât worry. Weâre gonna start on the edge of the pool firstâ @CAPS3 smiled. Then they started to stretch. When they were done, @PERSON1 had @CAPS2 start by going head first into the warm water from the edge of the pool. âThat was good,â said @PERSON1. â@CAPS5 try keeping your body straight, and your arms up. Try again. â@CAPS6 they walked over to the low diving boards and tried again. As @CAPS3 felt the water hit @CAPS7 arms, @CAPS7 legs came apart. @CAPS3 tried again and again and again. Every time @CAPS3 made a mistake; @CAPS7 arms went down, @CAPS7 hand was up too long @CAPS3 hit @CAPS7 fingers, @CAPS7 legs came apart, diving was getting less fun by the try. @CAPS5 every time @CAPS3 screwed up @PERSON1 gave @CAPS7 advice @CAPS5 never criticized. Finally, after @NUM2 tries @CAPS3 nailed @CAPS7 first dive. @CAPS3 felt such a sense of accomplishment! Then @CAPS3 went to the higher level diving boards, and nailed it after only four tries! After a couple dives on that one, @CAPS3 heard @PERSON1 say, âYouâre ready for the high dive.â @CAPS7 stomach did a flip-flop. @CAPS5 @CAPS3 followed him to the high dive and climbed. @CAPS3 could see the whole pool! @CAPS6 @CAPS3 bounced and jumped. @CAPS3 felt like @CAPS3 was weightless. At first @CAPS3 just went down a couple of times, @CAPS5 then @CAPS3 dived. Perfect! A great dive. The @CAPS3 tried a few flips, and soon @CAPS3 wasnât scared. After another perfect triple flip, @CAPS3 thought to herself. â@CAPS8 do you know. Patience pays off!!!"
6,"I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said @CAPS6re leaking trannie fluid. @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). @CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip I said to @CAPS2, @CAPS6 dont know that for sure he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didnt help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 werent sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car."
6,"I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you dont want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Specaly at cedar point you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force so I hope the thing would turn off. Butt @DATE1 I was going to cedar point and I count wait. So I got up took a shower and ate breakfast which was great my mom made blueberry mudines.  I got all of my close pack a week early because, I was so edsited. I put my clothes in the car and my brother, sister, mom, dads so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasnt so grate because, it was three hours long but we had a tv in our carso it didnt take as long as it normally does because, were occupied so it is like a shorter car ride for my brother sister and I. When we got into the howtell it was awesome because, it was like @NUM1 storys high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our room ont @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wainted to buy the furry things but she couldnt. My mom woke us up come on the rides open in about @NUM3 min we got be there. So I raced up out of bed running around like I got fire on my butt trying to find my clothes. So found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the others side of the bed. So by the time we were all up dressed and showered the rides have been going on for an hour so we walk over to the gate and got the one ride called million ofcare. The sigh said @NUM4 hours wait sorry the ride is know just to got started because of difficutys  with the seatbelts and others technical difuctlelys sorry. So my mom said wait here at ride it is realy fun. So was waited and waited I have no patience any more I will buy you a hot dog after this so I did and the ride was a blast @NUM1 hours at the park. Was fun but we had to go tomorow. And I got my hot dog.  That was my story of being patience at cedar point when all is you want to do was have fun. Sometimes you got to be patinced to get what you want."
6,"Lots of people are good at being patient Im not so good at it. But when your traveling along distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my @LOCATION2s house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves when family visits, so we dont mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. Ive had to have been there at least @NUM2 times in my life time. My mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store. Usually, she works @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she gets off work we would pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drank lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs. Until, my @CAPS3 died. I felt my heart break a little. I couldnt fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but all we could listen to was country. Since, we were going @CAPS7, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached, The up @CAPS7 store where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to @LOCATION2s. I got @CAPS8 and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was nothing to do in that car. I was angry at that point. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the drive way, and my @LOCATION2 running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another, ride to @LOCATION2s house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, Im almost positive will never stop getting bored during the ride. Being patient, is not one of my favorite things to do."
6,"If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1s @CAPS1, thats a different story. Ill tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldnt be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldnt get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didnt help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if Im very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait."
6,"Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.  My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office."
6,"It was the week befor @CAPS1. My mom was going to take my friend @CAPS2 and I to ceder point. @CAPS3 I asked my mom when we were going to leave? She said in about twenty five minutes! I said ok. @CAPS3 I called @CAPS2 to see if he was on his way? He answered the phone he said yea! I asked if he brout a sweat shirt? He said yea! I said ok because it will be sonda a chilli. @CAPS3 when he arrived he got out his suitcase, and we went to go pack our stuff in the car. Well we were doing that his mom got out to go talk to my mom. When we were all done his moon gave him a kiss on the check, and his mom took off @CAPS2 asked when we were going. Because he is not patient at all. Said in about five minitr.My mom got he suit case in the car. Well she was doing that we went to get snacks for the road. @CAPS3 when we got in the car. I asked my mom if we can hear ninety eight point seven. @CAPS2 said hurry up @CAPS6. linking. @CAPS3 my mom turned, it on, and up left. We got on the free way, way, and @CAPS2, and I put in shreck in @CAPS8 player. @CAPS2 fast forward the previews @CAPS3 after the movie we got to ceder point. We all got into are room, and I put on same jeans, and a body. My mom put on jeans and a t-shirt, and @CAPS2 put on a tank top and jeans. @CAPS3 we all wanted to go on the dragster first @CAPS3 we got in line. The line was pretty short. @CAPS3 when we got on the ride, @CAPS2 started to sweat, and freak-out. The ride took off. When it ended @CAPS2 went to the ponta podi . And when he came out I asked him if he was alright. He said now I am. I asked him what happened? He looked at me and said @CAPS12 things. I was getting sonda light. @CAPS3 we went on one more ride, and @CAPS2 through up. We were back to our room and took a shower. After that we played a boared game called checkers. It was pretty fun, then we went to bed the water park we were in the line for like fifteen minutes, and @CAPS2 started freaking out. @CAPS3 the rest of that day I was pretty annoying .The end."

6,"its where?  The woman asked for the third time. @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms, I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didnt say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often dont meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  @CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of youngs incorporated.  @CAPS3, youre with youngs?  @CAPS4 asked.   Do you know where the show room is?  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.  I said in a robotic voice.  @CAPS6t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  @CAPS8, sir.  @CAPS9 old are you?  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  @CAPS11, sir. I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. Are you getting paid?  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  yes,  sir.  But its @CAPS12 a lot.  Its more like volunteer work,  really.  @CAPS13 dont ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  thanks son. Youre welcome.  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think well both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dads shop, because if @CAPS4 didnt, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient."
6,"Patience is a key trait to have. People need patience for all sorts of things. I am very patient, most of the time. Some people struggle with patience, but I tend to handle situations well when it comes to being patient, for the most part. Why dont I share a story with you of a time when I was patient. It was @DATE1, and my ballet dance for the @ORGANIZATION1 had just finished. My class did pointe, but this year we were sharing our dance with the little, @ORGANIZATION2, dancers. Earlier in practice, we were all given a little one  to guide and dance with during the performance. We all became close to our little buddies especially @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 was my partner. She was so sweet and cute and she just loved  looking up to the other dancers and I. She always held my hand and she never wanted to stop dancing. I had met her mom for the first time, while waiting to go onstage. She told me about how much @PERSON1 talked about me and she loved dancing with me. I was touched by her comments and headed of to the stage feeling very confident. Finally, when the dance was done we all came rushing back stage. @PERSON1s  mom stopped me and asked if I would come take pictures with @ORGANIZATION3 before I changed. I was thrilled! We ended up going outside on the grass and we got some beautiful pictures. I gave her my address so she could send me copies. I went home after the @ORGANIZATION1 that night and told my mom all about it. Every day I asked her if I had mail untill about two weeks after the @ORGANIZATION1 and I  had just forgotten all about the pictures. One day my dad asked me if I had gotten them yet and I realized I had forgotten about them. I asked my mom again, but I still had no mail. I started asking her everyday again. Then, two months after the @ORGANIZATION1 I received a letter coming from @CAPS1 @PERSON1. I was so excited! It had seemed like she was never going to send them, as if she had forgotten too! As I opened the envelope  it held  a letter and some pictures. I was so happy  I wrote a letter back that day. It was a long  two months but I was patient and the pictures were definitly worth the wait. Oh, and did I mention Im still waiting for a reply."
6,"One hot @DATE1 day we decided to go to the lake to go swimming in good breezed water. I was excited but the only part I was worried about was the hour drive there. We all got ready with the quickness we couldnt wait another second @CAPS1 was really hot outside @CAPS1 was @NUM1° degrees. Me, my mom, my sister @CAPS2 and my brother @CAPS3 were loving  the car ride there  the @LOCATION1 was all the way up and we stoped at a gas station to get snacks and drinks. @MONEY1 was spent on each of us @CAPS5 for snacks. (we were having fun) @CAPS4, we were almost there @CAPS5 @NUM2 blocks away. When we got @NUM3 blocks closer thats when @CAPS1 all went down, their was. A line longer then ever. I was disappointed but @CAPS1 didnt really bother me I @CAPS5 want to go swimming and have a good time. I guess a lot of other people wanted to go to the lake on a beautiful @DATE1 day. as well. In @NUM4 minutes all we drove was @NUM5 blocks and thats when my mom was rethinking if we should go or not thats when she asked us. My brother and sister both agreed with my mom but I didnt, then I told my mom wea already waited for @NUM4 minutes if we leave that would have been a waste of time. Then I said besides we only have @NUM3 blocks left so we will definitely wait less then @NUM4 minutes probably @CAPS5 @NUM9 minutes. I @CAPS6 said @NUM9 minutes is better then @CAPS5 leaving and wasting @NUM4 minutes of our lives. They finally agreed to stay and by the time we were done discussing that we only had one block left. But @CAPS1 has been @NUM12 minutes of waiting so far thats why my brother was getting really mad so was my sister and mom. My mom was @CAPS5 about to leave but she noticed their was only @NUM5 cars infront of us. Two minutes passed and we were finally next, we had to pay to toget in then find a parking spot inside the lake area. @CAPS1 took an additional @NUM14 minutes till we got settled and started swimming we were having a blast. I told them @CAPS1 was worth @CAPS1 to stay in line to get here otherwise we wouldnt have had as much fun. That is why patience is the key. (@CAPS1 is good to be patient,(thats  why) you should always be patient.)"
6,"@CAPS1 mom always tells me that Iâm patient. She says that I would be a good teacher. (that what I want to be.) @CAPS1 mom always brags about it! I look like @CAPS1 mom a lot but Iâm built like @CAPS1 dad. (by the way I mean I have long legs, I get the patience from @CAPS1 dad also.) When Iâm mad I use the patience to intend what people have to say. When other people are mad or sad they come to me because they know that Iâll take it slow (by that I mean be patient with time.) âPatienceâ (thatâs @CAPS1 nick name its from mum) âyeah mum?â I say in a nice voice. Since one heat I in a come can for you. @CAPS12 @CAPS1 mom excitedly. â@CAPS2 Iâm @CAPS17â I sat down slowly. I proped @CAPS1 legs on the recliner. â@CAPS3 what do you want? I asked âYou know Iâm in the middle of doing homework.â â@CAPS4 I know but you know how weâve been looking for a child like to adopt right? Asked @CAPS1 mom â@CAPS4, I remember.â I replied, â@CAPS6 I think that were found the perfect one! â@CAPS7 @CAPS1 mom â@CAPS8?!?!â I @CAPS12. â@CAPS9 it a boy or a girl? What @CAPS9 his/her name? Where @CAPS9 she from?â I asked â@CAPS6 itâs a girl and shes @NUM1 years old her name @CAPS9 @CAPS10 (@CAPS11-la) and shes from @LOCATION1.â @CAPS12 @CAPS1 mom â@CAPS13 @CAPS1 gosh this @CAPS9 @CAPS3 exciting when @CAPS9 she commingâ I asked â@CAPS14â @CAPS1 mom got inturupted by the door bell â@CAPS15â she @CAPS12. We went to the door she was with a special mail deliver, @CAPS10 was sleeping â@CAPS17 you go maâamâ @CAPS12 the mail boy â@CAPS18 much. â@CAPS12 @CAPS1 mom and took her bags and I shut the door. The next day was a desaster, @CAPS1 new baby sister took everything out of @CAPS1 dresser. But I was patient and told her to put everything back with @CAPS1 help. Fall come I had to take the hard. @CAPS10 helped too by jumping in the pile of leaves, I guess itâs time to have a little fun right? @CAPS3 I jumped in them with her she helped me take all the leaves into a bigger pile. We jumped in them and that @CAPS9 the time that I was patient with @CAPS1 beway sister. @CAPS1 mom always tells me that Iâm patient she says that I would be a good teacher. (thatâs what I want to be)."
6,"I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like shes about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says theyre all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew Id do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a war. I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. Its too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled, @CAPS1 @PERSON1, thats not nice, please stop. @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!: I realized tothem thats like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldnt believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!"
6,"Patience is when you wait without complaining. There are many times when someone must be patience because many things are not instant. Kind of like when I got to go to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 last @DATE1. My heat was thumping against my chest. Adrenaline was pumping though my body. What a rush! I shouted. My mom, sister, her friend. Aubrey, my friend @PERSON1, and I just got off the @CAPS1 at @ORGANIZATION1. My legs ached with pain as @CAPS10 walked over to our final ride of the day, the mean green speedy machine the @CAPS2. The @CAPS2 is the longest collar coaster in the park, lasting two minutes, seventeen seconds and going upside down four times! the sign at the start of the line @CAPS8. A @NUM1 minutes wait, @CAPS8 my mom, thats not too bad. @CAPS4 didn@CAPS13 know how wrong @CAPS4 was when @CAPS4 @CAPS8 that. @CAPS5! screamed the many people on the ride above our heads. @CAPS10 were in line for nearly @NUM2 minutes now and still not even halfway through the trecherous line @CAPS6, @CAPS8 @PERSON1 in a relaxing tone as one of the fans sprayed him with the cool mist. Drip, drip, drip. Rain sprinkled from the sky. SShhh! It suddenly started to down pour! Sorry, the @CAPS2 will be closed until further notice. @CAPS8 a man speaking over an intercom. I was looking forward to the @CAPS2 too, complained @PERSON1. @CAPS10ll stay for a few more minutes and see if the rain stops @CAPS8 my mom. Fortunatly, the rain slowly came to an end. But the ride was still closed down. I noticed the men running the coaster were doing some test runs. @CAPS11@CAPS13 be long now. I @CAPS8 cheerfully. @CAPS10 stood in the monotonous line for what felt like forever. Finally were at the front of the line. I stared at the coaster as it stared back taunting me. Only @NUM3 people stood between me, and the @CAPS2. Now @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @CAPS10re next. This is it. Im on the ride. I yanked the seatbelt over my head like a @CAPS13-shirt. My heart was  trying to escape my chest. @CAPS14 fun! the guy running the coaster @CAPS8. He hit the button and @CAPS10 blasted off. Even though @CAPS10 waited two hours in a fourty five minute line, the ride was worth it. The six of us waited patiently and got what @CAPS10 deserved. A ride on the fast as lightning looping roller coaster the @CAPS2"
6,"I think patient is when some one is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework., chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because are she had was a math work shect ?? @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were ?? addition and subtracts. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side) which isnt that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that shes resting and not making man of mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all the days because all she bad to do was throw them back into the toy bar. Now , we go to her room. Ally messy room you first couldnt open the door. So she had to tog on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammer shut from all the clothes but luckily didnt wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about @NUM5 hour and a half. So in all thats been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner.  Her mom couldnt because she had to drop off her dad at the air part for work, so @CAPS2 was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had speghettl for dinner and her sister spilled the house all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time."
6,"I had a friend well she is @CAPS4 best friend and we know each other from @NUM1 grade then in @NUM2 grade she said she said she has to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until this one day came she called and @NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over are house. One of @CAPS4 mom friend calls me and I told  @CAPS1 (@CAPS4 best  friend) hold on someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on @CAPS4 bed while she  was still o the phone. I went to the living room and @CAPS4 moms friend said can you get me a glass of water and @CAPS4 moms five other friends said the some thing. I went and got them water. After that @CAPS4 mom said go take out the trash so I went and put on @CAPS4 scarf and took at the trash out the like @NUM4 mins I had her waiting. When I took out the trash @CAPS4 best friend was and she said @CAPS3 can you stay outside with me and play for a little bit and I forget all about @CAPS4 friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @NUM5 min. then said I got to go back inside. I ment in and sat on the sof and @CAPS4 moms friends that were over are house were talking and I sat with than talking laughing, playing, and watching t.v.  After two hours and a half while I am watching t.v. I tell myself what am I forgetting. I knew I forget something, but I didnt know what so I get up and I walk around the whole telling myself what  did I forget when I get to the room I was talking to @CAPS1 in I seen the phone on the bed and I picked up and said @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 I forgot about her. I said hello just to see if she was still there even if I had a feeling she didnt which did. She told me you kept me waiting for the longest time ever. I told her wow your so patient I would never wait that long. She come on youre @CAPS4 best friend. I would wait forever for you so we continued talking."
6,"There once was a little girl named @PERSON2 @CAPS10 was the important girl in the land of narrative. Narrative was a little land felled with loveing and patient people who waited for everything. And every child was patient but @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was a only child living with her mother and @CAPS12. @PERSON2 hated being the only child so: @PERSON2`s mother named @CAPS3 told her husband @CAPS1 that they should have another chilled so that @PERSON2 would not be only. Soon they told @PERSON2 that @CAPS10 would be having a little brother or sister @PERSON2 was very happy. Infact @PERSON2 was so happy that @CAPS10 ran up stairs and began to make up baby names. Then ran down stairs and shared them with her mother rocking in her chain. I like kuven said @CAPS12 walking toward the dinner table were @PERSON2 and her mother where siting. Ok said @PERSON2 cleaning the table of Do you like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or @CAPS6said. @PERSON2. I like @PERSON1 said @CAPS12 pushing in his chair. Me as well said mother walking up stairs toward her bed room. I can`t wait till the baby gets here said @PERSON2 on her way up the stairs. The next morning @PERSON2 a woken early to see if her mother had the baby. @CAPS7 you have the baby yet said @PERSON2 weaking up her mother and @CAPS12 @CAPS8 said the @CAPS12, the baby haves to grow inside of mommy okay. Okay said @PERSON2 . @NUM1 months later. Kerry got up very early screaming is here @CAPS7 it come @CAPS8, said the mother lefting her head over her belly to see @PERSON2. that baby will never come, I hate that thing I will be lonely for ever said @PERSON2 walking toward her bed room. Be patient @CAPS10 will com screamed @CAPS12 from the other room. @CAPS10 said @PERSON2 its a girl @PERSON2 got very much happy @NUM1 hour later oh, oh, oh screamed mother form her bed room. Are you okay mommy said @PERSON2 walking into mothers bedroom. The baby is coming call your @CAPS12 said mother. @PERSON2 yes mother going to have to deliver this baby okay. @NUM3 hours later dad come home running up the stair and went in his room and saw @PERSON2 his wifey @CAPS11 & the new baby @PERSON1 fast asleep. Told you if you where patience @CAPS10 would come said @CAPS12 talking to his self"
6,"One day when the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out I wanted it so bad so I asked my mom and she said maby for @CAPS2 and guess what @CAPS2 was coming up. It was @DATE1 and I couldnt wait so I went to school and I got it over with every day and I kept coming there and saying Im for sure that I will get a @ORGANIZATION1 just like mom and thats about the handreth time I said that to her and she said  you have to be patient or I will probley never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you say saying I want this and that hes going to think @LOCATION1 is not real so be patient. Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didnt care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days Im being patient I really cant believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when Im getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so Im really exited. So I was on a @CAPS5 break on the last @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I played video games to save up my time of being patient then the last @NUM3 days Ive been  playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there whose only @NUM3 more days antil @CAPS5 and I just played outside intel the day was over on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on @CAPS5 eve. Then the day came @CAPS5 finaly I saw  my presents and my mom said ya open them sort starred to seen them and once I opened all my present I did not see the @CAPS3, antil my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the @CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I dont have to be patient no more, the end"
6,"Do you ever fell like your @CAPS1 is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. The story starts at @TIME1pm my brother @LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister @PERSON2, and my friend @LOCATION1 came up from behind me and stopped @PERSON2 said ""I didnt want you to walk to get @LOCATION2 by urself"" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called @LOCATION2 and said we didnt see him and it was already @NUM1 he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door @PERSON2, and savanah were already at the party store @LOCATION1 questioned me and asked ""@CAPS2 did it take you so long"" I told her what happened as @PERSON2 pushed the @PERSON1 and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my @CAPS1 l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again."
6,"I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient  so my mom would think its time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel. But she still didnt say it was the time to get a phone the next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but better. I still didnt get it I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said @CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said wait @CAPS2 me still wondering   watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I dint do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house. @DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said @CAPS2 you can have your phone now and I hugged her tight and run out the door very eagerly to try it out."
6,"@PERSON1. I was in love with the guy! I swear middle school @CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 the girlâs choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. â@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.â I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who @CAPS1 @PERSON1âs friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1âs better friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now itâs @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself donât be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasnât because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today @CAPS1 @DATE2 and the dance @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1âs I have a note taped to it. It reads â@CAPS3 me your phone number and Iâll call you for the @NUM1.â. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think heâs testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didnât ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.â When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word. Yes!"
6,"A person I know that has a incredible amount of patience would have to be @PERSON1. He's the only science teacher for @NUM1 and @NUM2 graders. He is a really good guy once you get to know him more. The reason I think @PERSON1 has patience is because us as students are really loud and energetic all the time. I should know when our class is overly energetic, it's really noticeable. This is @PERSON1's first year teaching at @LOCATION1 crest charter @CAPS1. We are highly annoying at times and sometimes I get spaz attacks from my classes. Usually teachers will say ''@CAPS2 down!'' or ''shush!'' or something like that. @PERSON1 isn't one of those @CAPS3, he'll just stand still and cross his arms while looking at us. He never told us what that meant, but as times passed on we found out by ourselves, I don't think I have ever heard him shout at us or be really mad about it. In fact @PERSON1 hasn't even complained about it. Not even once have I heard him! Today during the meap, @PERSON3 said we could get a snack from our lockers quietly. @CAPS4 we did get our snacks from our lockers. But not quietly like he said or told us. @CAPS4 he just gave us the posture he makes when were loud, then we sat quietly for our next part of the meap. I'm really happy @PERSON1 is our home room teacher because he has a good sence of humor and he is also very understanding every single day. I think all teachers (including @PERSON1) have a huge amount of patience if I should say @CAPS4 my self. Right now, every body is either working hard and quietly on their meap or they are reading a book silently to themselfs. I can't hear @CAPS3 talking to each other @CAPS4 that means the class is silent. I don't know how this class would end up without @PERSON2 I know for a fact that @PERSON1 is awesome because he has good sence of humor, smart, and he knows how to keep us on the ball. @CAPS4 I know that @PERSON1 is one of the most patient person I know @CAPS4 far. He's always in a good mode and I've never seen him have a bad side. @CAPS4 he's a  awesome guy! Go @PERSON1"
6,"@CAPS1 my gosh! This is so pethetic! When are we ever going got up there? my little sister squealed as I tryed to make her be patient. @CAPS2 sierra, we have to be patient. I said calmly, weve only been in the line for @NUM1 minutes. I was trying to teach my little sister patience and as you can tell, it wasnt working. We were at cedar point and waiting in line for a huge rollercoaster. The steps grew higher and higher and the people at the top looked like tiny, little ants scurring around trying to find food. This is going to be a long wait, I thought, but after she rides that rollercoaster, she will want to do it again! I had a great plan. We waited and waited for what seemed like days! But it had only been around a hour, we scotted closer, inch by inch as are made it to the top! My little sister had complained the whole time! It was so annoying! I hope my plan works, I thought to myself, because this is miserable! We watched as the kids in front of us climbed abored. The people who got off were walking like they were drunk because of the fun twists an turns of the beast. My stomarth turned like the cotton candy machine. We waited and then they were back. The people looked dizzy and one person had a green face. Ew! My sister and I climbed abored. The man with blue hair asked, Are you ready? And we were off. Then I heard a dreadful noise of click, click, and click as the great beast climbed the mountain. Then the noise stoped and screams of terror filled my ears. Screams of laughter and screams of puke I swalled my lunch back down maybe it would have a good idea to eat lunch after we had rode the moving cars. My sister was screaming with delight as we swerved here and there and everywhere. At least shes having fun along with me. Before we knew it we stopped. Awesomed I looked at her and asked @CAPS3 you have fun? @CAPS1 @CAPS5! she exclaimed ecitedly. @CAPS6s do it again! And guess what? She never complained in the line after that. That is my story of patience. I hope you liked it."
6,"@CAPS1, I have a question. I said loudly. @CAPS2 is your question? said @CAPS1. I  was woundering if I could get highlights  in @CAPS4 hair? I said. @CAPS3 would you get them done, and that would cost him around @NUM1 bucks depending were you go. @CAPS4 mother explained. I said well are neibor @PERSON1, doesnt she have a step daughter that works at a salon. @CAPS5, but how would you get there its like an hour away from here. @CAPS4 mother said. I dont know, can you call @PERSON1 and ask her? I said. @CAPS6, @CAPS4 mother said. After @CAPS4 @CAPS1 got off the phone with @PERSON1 @CAPS4 @CAPS1, told me that @PERSON1 was going to take me to her step daughters salon today. I had gotten really excited. Once @PERSON1 had gotten to @CAPS4 house to pick me up, we started to talk about that I wanted to get light blonde streaks with some medium brown streaks in @CAPS4 hair. We had finally gotten to her salon and there was @NUM2 other people there so I had to be patient and wait @CAPS4 turn. After the @NUM3 person done I hopped up into the chair a frog, and she started mixing all the eye for @CAPS4 hair. I had never gotten @CAPS4 hair dyed before so this was @CAPS4 first time. @PERSON1s step daughter started to put tin foil in @CAPS4 hair and then put dye on the hair that was on top of the tin foil, and she would fold the tin foil and do another look of hair. She had finally finish putting the dye and tin foil in @CAPS4 hair, and I thought it was over since we had been there for @NUM4 hours, but I was still not done. She told me to sit in this chair and she put a @CAPS7 like shopped heater over @CAPS4 head and told me to sit there for about @NUM5 minutes. After @NUM5 minutes was up she had taken all the tin foil of @CAPS4 hair and she washed @CAPS4 hair. I loved @CAPS4 hair so much but it was a very long wait so right before me and @PERSON1 left she had said thank you and that I was very patient. this is a time when I was patient to get @CAPS4 hair dyed."
6,"A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my presents there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the days got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didnt even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didnt get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and apps and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. Thats why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision thats the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but its some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..Im happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. Thats why??? can play it because Im saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one."
6,"Patience is tough to achieve sometimes. But that doesn't mean you should give up keep trying and your will succeed, rush through life and become impatient and you used and succed. I will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. ""@CAPS1 year in the fall a big race takes place. All the animals in the @CAPS2 come to the. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that @CAPS1 year, one slow animal and one first around commute to see who is this up is champion. At the time the @CAPS5 was the fastest @CAPS2 around. @CAPS11 signed up @CAPS1 year and won @CAPS1 time. The @CAPS15 had signed up to complete this year. @CAPS11 was very wat don't in himself and was had to pride that @CAPS12 because @CAPS11 was about, slow and @CAPS11 can't be a champion. ""runners get ready!"" shouted the announcer. The @CAPS5 and @CAPS15 lined up. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! "" @CAPS5 rushed ahead kicking the air. For the @CAPS15 very slowly waiting behind. @CAPS5 run like @CAPS11 has never won. @CAPS11 never looked back. @CAPS11 wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his any ways. Right? I mean, @CAPS11 was the fastest animal. @CAPS15 continued on his way, slowly but surely making his way to the finish line. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS6 ."" @CAPS5 stopped and looked around. No one was around. ""@CAPS9 is that noise?"" @CAPS11 asked aloud. ""@CAPS6"" it came from his stomach @CAPS11 was so caught up in the race @CAPS11 didn't realize how hungry @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS12 one little handful of berries."" @CAPS11 decided. @CAPS11 picked a handful, then another and another. Finally @CAPS11 was full and a little bit sleepy. ""I'll @CAPS12 take a little nap after all that @CAPS15 ain't gonna catch up anyways."" @CAPS11 laid down and slept. Little did @CAPS5 know that the whole time @CAPS11 was eating and napping, @CAPS15 was catch up? @CAPS11 saw the @CAPS5 sleeping and decided but to wake him @CAPS12 to case @CAPS11 was sick is @CAPS11 continued to slowly very slowly walk up the hill to the inish line. @CAPS5 woke to the sound or cheering. @CAPS11 stood up. The @CAPS15 won! @CAPS11 raced to the finish line but was to late, the @CAPS15 had already won. If @CAPS11 had been patient @CAPS11 might have won."
6,"Go! @CAPS5 coach yelled. @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. @CAPS5 day was planned, first soccer then @CAPS5 friends birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain drop pound down on @CAPS5 head. Before I knew it I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started pouring. @CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. @CAPS2! The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally the refs come over and announced, ""the game has been delayed."" I signed and slouched down on a picnik table. I knew now I would @CAPS7 to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slamed down on the root and thunder cracked."" @CAPS1 would I make it to @CAPS5 party now?"" I through. @CAPS2! @CAPS2! @CAPS2! More thunder came. It had to go @NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already on minute @NUM2. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at @NUM3. We were now at minute @NUM4. We listened closely until we hear a @CAPS2! From far north frustrated I say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!"" @CAPS5 team began to count the minutes again. Finally after the longest @NUM1 minutes of @CAPS5 life there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! @CAPS5 team and I sprinted on to the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field with our white socks and jersys splattered. With mud. Every one of us were sopping wet. @CAPS5 mom gave me the ""@CAPS6 up"" look and I quickly ran to the car."" I will still make it to @CAPS5 party but, I will be just a few minutes late and I @CAPS7 to change in the car."" I said to @CAPS5 self. As I sprinted through the wet grass I heard @CAPS5 coach yell from behind me, ""@CAPS7 fun at your party @PERSON1, and @CAPS8 for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied ""@CAPS8 coach!"" That day I realized being patient is a good quality to @CAPS7. Many people appricite it when you are understaning and don't complian during difficult times."
6,"Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was every patient one day when I was ten year old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn cernal cought in my throught .That was an aginizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy."
6,"Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Im the kind of girl who loves to do all of the artsy kind of stuff with colored papers, and cool sizors, and stuff like that. So my friends birthday party was @DATE1 and I wanted to make a homemade gift and card for her. But I didnt know what to make her. So I went to my mom to help and ideas. She told me all kinds of stuff that I could do, but the one I loved most was the bouga of flowers. I felt like I was like a real designer because I had so much fun making it. Plus it turned out really good. So I needed the hot glue gun to glue on the pettals to the flower, and it ended up being a huge mess. So then my mom came in and said hey its time to go to bed it is @NUM1. I said but I have glue all over can I clean up first. She said yes so I quik ran to the bathroom to clean up. I tryed to go fast. So after I went to my room and went to bed. I woke up the next morning and my hand was stuck to my head. So oucusly I started to freke out. Then my mom came in and she saw what happened. So we went to the bathroom to rince it out and we got my hand of just not the glue. So ya see I didnt get all of the glue of from the night befor and now I have glue in my hair. So I get really mad because I have to be at my friends house at @TIME1 and it wa @NUM2. Plus I had to finish my flower for my friend. My mom just told me to be patient. I said what does patient mean. Well she said it means to be understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. I said oh so that means that I probly could be there in time if I am patient. Yes my mom said. So thats what I did and I ended up getting there at @TIME2 and she loved her presant. So I learned something that day and I got the good benafit out of it."
6,"One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. @CAPS5 did you not take the shot? whispered @PERSON1. @CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain. @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The danes rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. @CAPS5 did you not take the shot? whispered @PERSON1. @CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6s back turned. @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. @CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased. @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances."
6,"A time when I was patient was this month when I was working on the haunted house with my friends from @NUM1-@CAPS1 club for the @NUM1-@CAPS1 @CAPS3 theme. Alot of the kids wanted to hurry up and get it finished for the competition, including me, but we were patient and took our time so it would turn out perfect and just the way we wanted it to. On our free time we went to all the other haunted houses to see how the other clubs were doing. Alot of them were really good, but some were ok because they were rushing things. And trying to be the first ones done. In one of the haunted houses, there was a ghost that was hangin from the roof, but it kept tipping over because they didnt tie it like their suppose to, eventually it fell off the roof. So we were about done with our house, but there was something missing? I said to myself? @CAPS4 would make it scarier? I know @CAPS4 we can do, I yelled out. Everyone looked at me waiting to say wat I had to say, @CAPS4 we could do is find a way to where it makes it look like theres something flying around the house dropping things on people. Everyone smiled and said we could give it a try. so we did alot of different things trying to make it work, finally we found a way and completed it. The next night we were ready for the competition. @CAPS5 time  said the leader. People started coming in. there was so much screaming and laughing. One of the leaders of the show bored layed on the ground yelling help ahhhh we laughed at her and helped her up. Everyone made their votes for the best, and scariest haunted house. We were waiting patiently, while we ate a snack, while other clubs were going crazy and getting mad, waiting for the show board to announce the winner. Finally they announced the winner. The winner of the best and scariest haunted house of the @NUM1-@CAPS1 haunted house theme goes to the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. @CAPS9 is my club. Other clubs were asking how we did it so good, and all we told them was we were patient, and took out time."
6,"I elevator tapping my foot, smooth jazz music humms out of speakers above me. Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the ??? I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the ??? as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago, @CAPS2 how much longer? The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, not much longer now dear. @CAPS3, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but cant help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @CAPS5 texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @CAPS5 scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope. @PERSON1  the doctor is ready to see you now. @CAPS4, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. You know its funny, @CAPS5 says well snapping her gum. @CAPS6 someone. So young you were the most patient person out there! I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that Im a patient person.  stand in the"
6,"Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you dont have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didnt want to wait so she didnt look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldnt really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So thats what happens when you dont have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so thats my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences."
6,"Shoring through my window, the sun woke up bright and early on @DATE1 @TIME1. Oh great, I thought to myself, @CAPS10 another day I have to babysit. You're probably wondering why I'm dreading babysitting so here goes. My brother and I were home alone for a couple of hours one afternoon a couple summers ago. Everything was great until right before nap time, go figure. He would scream ""@CAPS1 napple time!"" and run through the house. When I finally reached where he stopped to get his blankie, I was furious. So I called my parents and they rushed home as fast they could. Then I had only been @NUM1, and now I'm about to be @NUM2. Hopefully those couple years would help me control my younger brother. On @TIME1, right when I woke up. I was going to set out and try babysitting again. Climbing out of bed. I undressed and put on my lucky skinny jeans. I was going to need all of the luck I could get. In the bathroom, I brushed my teeth, combed through my hair, and took an @CAPS2. Standing at the top of our spiral staircase looking down, I thought, here goes nothing. My @CAPS6 greeted me with a warming smile and a kiss. ""@CAPS3're off to do some @CAPS4 shopping. I love you, and be patient with your brother, please.""  ""@CAPS5 bye @CAPS6 @MONEY1."" I replied flatly. Up the stairs, I turned left to my brothers' room. ""@CAPS7 @TIME1, @CAPS8."" I whispered lifting him out of his racecar crib. He was pleased with the breakfast I laid out for him, scarffing it down quickly. Getting him dressed was easy. Play time followed swiftly behind with @CAPS1 difficulties. phew. Crankily @CAPS8 picked up his toys with my assistance. Ok next, nap time, I quickly reminded myself. ""@CAPS10 be patient"" I could hear my @CAPS6 saying. Without getting frustrated, @CAPS8 reluctantly got in his crib. I stayed calm too. Is @TIME1 now easy it's suppose to be? I was pleased with myself for asking him nicely to go to bed. Guess what? He did! He actually listened! He even whispered ""I love you car- win"" in his cute baby voice while drifting into his sleep. As they say, patient goes a long way."
6,"A time when I was being very patient was when I went to @CAPS1 at ceider point.. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldnt go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called The dead zone, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say were going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesnt have any mechanical problems. Thats when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called The mauerie. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I dont think so."
6,"This here story Im about to tell you is a story of a young boy. @CAPS4 would save the villeg form a horrible monster, who wasnt a monster at all, all @CAPS4 would need was a watch, a shovel, and a littel bit of patience. This boy was so scard that if you were so much as a pencle @CAPS4 jump a mile. @CAPS4 was aftine times call scard @PERSON1. Well @PERSON1 had just goten home from school when a car drove by this all must gave him a hart-a-take. We sat and waited until @CAPS4 calmed down. Then went inside, his sister was doing her home work. @CAPS4 wanted to play outside and play, she told him to be patient. @PERSON1 hated waiting for anything. His mom handed him a packed and said its for you it came in the mall. @CAPS4 thanked her and went up stars @CAPS4 was so exited to open it @CAPS4 looked at the pakeg and frownd it said not to open until @DATE2. @CAPS4 looked at the clallender it was @DATE1 @CAPS1 IN @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! @CAPS4 shouted, @CAPS4 was tempted to open but @CAPS4 know what the pacage said. For the past @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @PERSON1 had been looking at the package. As the clook struck midnight @CAPS4 ripped the packege open. There lay the niced watch @CAPS4 had ever seen.  Then a hit is creater comes in his room it stops in the door way a replays a recorded messege  I am @PERSON2 I have come to desto the village of @CAPS6 @PERSON1 trys to move but @CAPS4 is to scard, @PERSON2 starts to talk agian if you want to stop me you will need a ton of con in tration and time of thought. @PERSON1 nods his head that is all @CAPS4 can do. @PERSON2 said you will need a watch to keep time. If you run I will not stop you if you stay for @NUM1 @CAPS3 I will leave the creater leaves, @PERSON1 thinks about all that had just hapened @CAPS4 decids to stay.On the thred day the monster reterns and tells @PERSON1 @CAPS4 will rip of his head. @PERSON2 grabs his head and falls. There stand his @CAPS8. @PERSON1 gets up and hits his @CAPS8."
6,"Hello, my name is @PERSON1 and I went to the dentist @NUM1 days ago. I hate going to the dentist. It scares me and sometimes I have to wait for a while and I get really unpatient but this time I didnt. my @CAPS2(@CAPS1) and I (@PERSON1) were being occward quiet in the car on the way to the dentist.  My @CAPS2 knew that I hated going to the dentist, so she tried to be patient with me. But that didnt work out so @CAPS5. Everytime my @CAPS2 would mention the dentist, I would yell at her and wed get into a huge argument. So the whole car ride there was complete silence except for the occasional bark of our dog, rover. When we got to the building, we parked the car and just stood there, looking at the building come on hanny, lets go inside my @CAPS2 said graciously. @CAPS2, my teeth feel fine, can leave now? @CAPS3, your coming with me. Now!! I dont like to get my @CAPS2 frusterated, but Id do anything to get away from the place. We walked in the waiting room and sat in a chair. I could tell that my @CAPS2 was going to talk to me. its only the dentist, what are you scared of? I didnt want to answer my @CAPS2, but Id get in trouble if I didnt. The patientness and the @CAPS5 @CAPS8. I dont want to talk about it, in said as I started to turn away. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1? The doctor can see you now, yelled the nerse . @CAPS5, I thought. here goes nothing. @CAPS6 to see you again @PERSON2 doctor @PERSON3 said. My @CAPS2 just nodded and sat down by the big opperating chair. Doctor @PERSON3 cleaned my teeth and took an x-ray of them, just in case I held any cavities. It took a while for him to return. At first I was being patient, but then as time went on, I started to get impatient. I almost lost my cool until I thought to myself @CAPS7 in and out deeply. @CAPS8 was getting better since I was one patient young lady! So everytime I go to the dentist or anywhere that takes time, I know how to be patient."
6,"Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. This is a time when I had to be patient and I got to see something that I will never forget. It was about three years ago at my grandma and grandpas house. They live about four and a half hours away in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I go up to there house sometimes and this time I was coming up there in the early fall. When I finally arrived there I had so much fun with my two cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, but later in the week my grandpa wanted to do something special with only me later. I was so excited. Around @NUM1 we left the house and followed their paths to the rye-field. In the rye-feid my grandma made a wooden tree house to observe all the animals in. Its @NUM2 feet tall so you need a latter to get inside of it. So we both climed up the latter, me first so if I fall he would be their  to catch me. When we got inside the tree house we sat in two confortable chairs. My grandpa told me to be very quiet so I dont scare the animals away. We waited and waited and waited. I was being very patient because how cool would it be to see a real live animal? I dont normally see deer running around in my yard in @LOCATION1! After thirty minutes I was getting bored and I asked politely if we could go because I dont think their coming today. He said okay maybe we can try again tomorrow. Just as we were about to climb down my grandpa froze and motioned his hand telling me to come to him I was confused at what he was trying to tell me but I found out as I looked out the window. A mother deer and her little baby foal were eating the corn and carrots we laid out for them. To me it was so cool and it was an amazing experience that Ill remember my whole life. Thats why people should always be patiant. I did and I got to see thing Id never seen before. So be patient and trust me youll get rewarded for it."
6,"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4 grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is @NUM1 dollar. That was a lot of money. She @CAPS11't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. So she was suppose to be coming on @DATE1. She didn't come. I was sick so I called @CAPS4 @CAPS2 at her job. I said, ""@CAPS2 why didn't @CAPS3 come."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said,"" @CAPS5 she is coming you just have to be patient."" @CAPS6, I said. Next day was @DATE2. ""@CAPS2 is she here yet"" I said. ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5 be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""@CAPS6, I understand.""I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So @CAPS4 mom called @CAPS4 godmom. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2. ""@CAPS11 I have a @CAPS12. @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger. I said @CAPS13 to @CAPS4 uncle and @CAPS4 mom said she was not coming. I told @CAPS4 mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. @CAPS4 mom said to @CAPS4 uncle @CAPS14 ""should I get her something to eat. I thought she ment @CAPS4 grandmother. So I thought for a while her who is her. So I called back @CAPS4 mom said ohh I get food for uncle @CAPS14 dog. I said, @PERSON1's?  For a dog? She said know dog food. So @CAPS4 mom got me from @CAPS4 god mothers house I could not walk because @CAPS4 legs, back, arm and every part that I @CAPS11 move on @CAPS4 body hurt. So @CAPS4 grandmother came to her house because we have a keys. So she said where @CAPS16? @CAPS4 uncle whispered something and I said she here! Ran in @CAPS4 uncle room and hug her I said how are you because when I went for @CAPS4 grandmother birthday. She live in south caroline so yeah. The is @CAPS4 writing. That is when I was patient. So I could wait for @CAPS4 mom's @CAPS1."
6,"When I was really patient when I wonti my pcar and mother to cook me some lazuge. I did not haved any of it scence my pass away is @DATE1. My mom had my @CAPS1  to cook @CAPS2 on my first birthday. when she cooked some for my first birthday party it was all goned. My @CAPS3 mother cooked @NUM1 pans of it. It was so good it was gone soon as she had put it out when I say soon I mean soon. I turned @NUM2 years old. My mother did it big for my birthday party. My mom died from open heart sergrey. She was @NUM3 years old. She had alto friends at her furnal. The furnal was very nice. But getting back to what I was writing about so In @DATE2 I asked my @CAPS1. To cook me some . She said ito me girl it coust to much to make it. I said @CAPS1 do you want me to gived you some money to cook the food, for me. She said no save your little money that you have. I said but @CAPS1 its okay to take my money to buy my lazangae and cook it for me. She said girl what did I say. So I hurry up and put my money in my pocket. Then I was keeping it moving. When we got in the truck she said now @CAPS5 I am going to cook it for when I get some , more, money, and when I pay my bills. In @DATE3 she cooked me some. The day she cooked me some it was @CAPS6 @NUM4, @DATE3. My antyes came over a got some, my brother and sister got some, and my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 got some. When they all wont I some I stood there and watch them get some, and when to stop getting some. Selfer when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 got some. I did not tell them when it was anoft because I live in they house. My brother and sister lives with them. The lanag only lasted for @NUM5 days and that it. When she cooked it I was happy. I brang it to school and ate it for my lunch."
6,I waiting  I was looking forward staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. @CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.
6,"Yes, yes, yes, we all know what @CAPS8 anglers best friend is.  @CAPS4 the trick is, surviving it! Especially when you dont have any of it!. PATIENCE! Being as crazy and hot tempered as I am, its definitely not my gift! @CAPS4, as they say. patience has its reward, I just had to try it out@CAPS1 I murmered as I climbed onto the ivory colored sail boat. @CAPS2 going to catch a @CAPS3 fish today. @CAPS4 little did I know was about to get the catch of my life. Once we got out to about @NUM1 feet we decided to cast out. I casted out as far as I could and let the boat do the rest. After the line was far enough behind I locked the reel in its holder, and went on to stalking the fish on the under-water camera. I was still watching the fish when my @CAPS5s and sisters reels went off. I raced to the deck to check my pole . As still as a statue. @CAPS6, shucks! I thought despairingly. @CAPS7 next time. @CAPS8 hour of vigorous action went on in lower deck. @ORGANIZATION1 after @ORGANIZATION1 after @ORGANIZATION1. My pole was still dead. Patience was being sucked out of me like a @CAPS3 truck on the dunes sucked gas! why dont I get anything? I thought. Just then my pole curved. @CAPS9!  @CAPS10 got a @CAPS3 one! I thought. I reeled it in carefully, not wanting to unhook the giant. My prize was lifted out of the water, and my heart sunk. My prize ended up to be @CAPS8 old slimy life preserver. @CAPS1! I screemed. @CAPS12 @CAPS13 PATIENCE.! I thought. I whipped the life preserver off into the deep blue water and sulked back to my chair. I plopped down in my chair agrily. Just then my pole bent and babbed around. @CAPS14! Another life jacket! I thought. @CAPS4, curiosity got the best of me and I whipped in my line. @CAPS4, to my surprise I had cought a huge @ORGANIZATION1! Thanks to my @CAPS15 bit of patience I caught the biggest @ORGANIZATION1 of the day. @CAPS12 matter how many life preservers you catch just remember .  patience is the key to success."
6,"Have you ever been to cedar @CAPS1? Well if you have then you probably is now about long lines. @CAPS4 were in cedar point in the middle of the @DATE1 and it was hot.  I saw the tap the'll @CAPS2 touring over overy other roller coaster. My mom, dad, and brother were in the car and @CAPS4 all gazed at it like someone had just glued us to it. @CAPS4 walked in the park after setting in and I was really anxious to and get on some rides. The first ride @CAPS4 stopped at was the @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS4 stopped there because @CAPS4 wanted to start of our day. Or a smaller roller coaster. The line wait was about @NUM1 minutes and @CAPS4 could tell that the lines were going to be long today.  Once @CAPS4 got off of the @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4 discussed where to go next. I suggested that @CAPS4 went to the magnum because that was close and I wanted to ride it really bad. When @CAPS4 got there I saw the times were about an hour long and I sighed. ''@CAPS3 is going to be a long day.''  @CAPS4 got of the magnum and headed over towards the millenium force. @CAPS4 got in line and had to wait an hour and a half but that gave me time to get ready to go on it . The ride was really fun and I and got scared of the @ORGANIZATION1 but I knew that I would have to overcome that fear to be able to go on the @ORGANIZATION1. My family headed over, my dad, my brother and I were pumped but my mom choose to sit out. @CAPS4 walked in the line and were amazed at the three hour wait time. After three excruciating hours of waiting in the blistering heat, @CAPS4 climbed on. I saw that light turn green and @CAPS4 rocketed up. The ride was awesome, like nothing I had ever done. I wanted to do it again but @CAPS4 decided to leave and come back next @DATE1. That day was fun, but I learned that patience is important and when you have to wait so long, you usually will enjoy it and it pays off."
6,"The time I was patient was when @CAPS4 went to @LOCATION1 ""mom!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS1's go I want to leave I'm packed and ready to go."" @CAPS2 mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beutiful @DATE1 in @LOCATION2 and it was also @CAPS2 step dad's birthday. ""@CAPS3 you need to be patient okay, @CAPS4 have a long drive, do you have everything you need."" @CAPS5 got me there. I had to get, coloring materials, the portable @CAPS6 player, ect. I had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 needed until @CAPS2 stomach growled it sounded like a bear protecting it's cubs, fierce, and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in @CAPS2 head, food thats what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips. Saltandvinager, sour crean and onion (caross) and jolepenyo ceddar(yum). Now I have everything I thought, ""of @CAPS4 go."" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom and again I rushed out the door ""got the address,"" asked @CAPS2 father."" @CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it."" @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started to go @CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 was sleeping lik arock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks shore. after @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitment was rushing so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but I was marked impossible. Finally @CAPS2 step father yelled ""wake up!!"" I was so tierd when I woke up, "" are @CAPS4 there yet, first thing that came out of @CAPS2 mouth ""yeah"" and, of course, the first things I did was jump up and out of the care! ""@CAPS12!"" @CAPS2 mother shouted. I paused as if I was a charactor in a video game and the player press pause."" @CAPS13 take in some off the bags."" ""@CAPS14"" I said with a scowse on @CAPS2 face. ""@CAPS15 youhave to be patient"" as I took in the bag there it was to condo of @CAPS2 dreams and the first thing I did was sleep."
6,"@CAPS7 were  is I dad he didn't come hone yet, right  ??? . ""@PERSON1, sweet heart,"" @CAPS2 @CAPS7 begain,"" Your father was called out in to war."" ""@CAPS1"" I ran up to @CAPS2 room passing back and forth saying he could have said good bye, I haven't seen him in two weeks now he's gone."" @CAPS2 @CAPS7 walked in "" @PERSON1 I know this is hard for you but you can send him letters."" I know I was going to start one now same we."" @CAPS3 ""she said as she walk out I wrote a letter saying dad you could have said good bye but you left.

I ""@CAPS9 @CAPS7 yelled ""@CAPS1"" ""you have mail"" I ran down the stairs to the kitchen and them was something on the counter for me @CAPS6 hard @CAPS2 name on @CAPS6 and @CAPS6 didn't say who @CAPS6 was from.

6,"Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, Ill be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least Ill have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so Im not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, Im going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, shes transferred everything, Ive proved Im deticated, Ive kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, Ive been watching the neighbors pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and Im working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, Ive been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isnt sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. Ill probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, Ill have to continue everything Im doing now. So, I wont be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!"
6,"My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience."
6,"Once upon a time there was a girl named @PERSON2. She had always dreamed to be a princess. Every present she got was either a dress or jewelry. She loved to try on dresses. She had two sisters both @NUM1(one year older than @PERSON2) there name were @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. @CAPS3 house is an old house located in the woods. One day @PERSON2 went out to get the mail, and a man with a tuxedo on gave her a letter that looked very fancy. @PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud, it said @CAPS2 @PERSON2, your invited to ball at the castle on @DATE1 at @NUM2 pm. @PERSON2 screamed in exitment. @PERSON2 decided to go to the mall to look for a ball gown. She found a beatifulgown but it was to much money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price was I she helped around the store for a couple of days. She accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours for two days. And fonaly her patients paid off. She could take the dress home. She drove home and put the dress on. She only had an hour so she had to hurry. She put her makeup and jewelry on and looked at her self in the mirror and said I did it. She got in the car and drove to the castle, it was so beautiful the way the moon hit the gold paint. @PERSON2 got out of the car and walked inside the castle. She walked down the stairs and every one stared. It was @CAPS3 best day of her life to have everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came up to introduce him self and when she turned around he fell in love. @PERSON2 couldnt believe the prince talked to her. He asked her to dance. They danced all night. When the prince went on stage he called her name and she went on stage. He asked her will you marry me, she said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true."
6,"@CAPS1! @CAPS2 whined, her voice escalating into a wail. You cant do this to me. Im ten! @CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I cant leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey! @CAPS4 cant you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year! @CAPS2s mother sighed. I know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasnt fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16? @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 @CAPS7 if!. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 countys only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. @CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you! @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mothers red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, @CAPS12, why dont you play with little @PERSON4? @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting little @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when theyve asked to play one for the billionth time. @CAPS2 we need to talk. @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side, honey, youve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog! @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe hed still be game for you."
6,"@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2! I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. @CAPS5 down, @PERSON1, my @CAPS2 told me. Im coming, she said. Im not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. Its also nice to just take a @DATE1 off and @CAPS1 up to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive isnt that short. My @CAPS2 had just finished giving the man our tickets. @CAPS6 your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, he told us. @CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first? my @CAPS2 asked me. @CAPS10 about the @CAPS11? I asked my @CAPS2 @CAPS12 not? she replied. By the way if you didnt know my name is @PERSON1. But thats not important right now. Whats important is getting on the @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the @CAPS11 isnt the biggest ride, but its still pretty big. The @CAPS4 is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The @CAPS11 ended up being a blast! After the @CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, The mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 and the @CAPS22. @CAPS23 right @PERSON1, pick the last ride, my @CAPS2 said @CAPS24 that was easy. We still hadnt gone on my favorite ride yet. @CAPS25s go on the @CAPS26 force, I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. @CAPS24,  Ive been on the ride, and its definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldnt be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and Im glad I waited for the best ride."
6,"RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here!  It took lots of my patience  to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  @ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  @CAPS4 I didnt care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named @PERSON1  told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they werent bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now were at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder  I  already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself be patient. @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he  just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most."
6,"A time when I was patient was at @CAPS1 the largest indoor water park I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. @CAPS2 time @NUM1our @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice but it was only @NUM2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, thats not fair I thought to my self but I knew if I wanted to make it to @CAPS1 I had to be patient and wait it out. I have to go to the bathroom I said in a moaning vice. well cant you hold it? my mother asked Im about to explode and your asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myelf. ok pull over here, but its gonna add to to our @CAPS2 time.  I @CAPS4t core! I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say @CAPS2 time @NUM3. @CAPS6 man that means no more bathroom breaks I m gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. A hour or two went by when I heard the @CAPS3  say arive on destinaton on left  @CAPS8! I schreeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1 but then I saw a sign that water park closed! when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said sorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow. @CAPS9 out it wasnt open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I couldnt we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So at @TIME1 the park was still closed and we were checked out I guess we can stay for the rest of the day. ll go send one more night my dad said. @CAPS8. I get to go in the park! And that was the time I was patient."
6,"Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just dont have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and the all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just alittle bit to much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didnt know what he was doing. @CAPS2 one actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady @PERSON1 @CAPS1 loved my speech! After we my friend, @ORGANIZATION1 and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to eachother and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, @CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him? then @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at eachother, in a bad way. After a few days we wont talking to each other since @CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But ofcourse, @ORGANIZATION1 wasnt patient at all. He was eager to tell @CAPS1 that me and him were friends but we couldnt tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that were both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like @NUM1. Haha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 had gone and told @CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @CAPS2 one laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had @CAPS2 patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, @CAPS3 having patience is a good thing but sometimes people cant have patience when they want to become friends."
6,"Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I dont know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didnt care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasnt like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I m daddys little girl? I think you couldve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. Thats when daddys little girl comes in handy!"
6,"To @CAPS4 being patient means to not while if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you. Thats what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasnt going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music. mom that our favorite song. @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said you have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here. @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. lets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said,  @NUM2 hours later. My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. @CAPS8 you dont crack @CAPS5 its are turn to take the pictures I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal. @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next. The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. @CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I want. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in there  life just like @CAPS4"

6,"Im not a very patient person so im going to be wrighting about what patience @CAPS6. Patience @CAPS6 when you dont complain when your board or waiting for somthing. For example (for your convenance I @CAPS1 be wrighting a story about patience, please  take to note that this story @CAPS6 completely untrue) @CAPS1 was walking home and saw an elderly woman, she was having trouble with her grocerys. @CAPS1 wanted to help her but all he was thinking about was his cousin @CAPS2 that @CAPS4 be arriving at his house any moment now. @CAPS1 walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied if you could I live over @CAPS3 she pointed to a large tan house. @CAPS1 carried her things to the door. @CAPS3 you go, he said. @CAPS4 you mind helping me put them away the woman asked. @CAPS1 thought about how his mother never wanted him to go into a strangers house, but @CAPS1 sort of knew her, so he said that he @CAPS4 help the woman smile. @CAPS1 then picked up the bags and said, @CAPS6 your home unlocked @CAPS7 its not she replied, where are your keys @CAPS1 asked, I beleve there lost somwere in the lawn. @CAPS1 searched for about a half hour, then he found them under a bush. He brought the keys to her and said @CAPS3 you go, she opened the door and he helped her with her grocres. When they were all put away @CAPS1 said @CAPS11 I ought to be going. @CAPS11 not without somway I can repay you said the woman @CAPS13 go find my purse. @CAPS1 waited and waited, it had to have been a hour. The woman came out of the kitchin with some change. @CAPS15 its only change, I couldnt find my wallet she said and gave him the change. @CAPS1 left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman. @CAPS1 told his mom about his good deed and his cousin @CAPS2 got to stay longer. This was my example of patience, if this ever happens to you make sure your patient and know the person."

The line was the longest to get my driving test, so @CAPS2 thinking to myself to get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend think its annoying and awkward. ""@LOCATION1, I wonder if they had a vending machine here."" ""I doubt @CAPS1,"" I proclaim. @CAPS3 glance at me and I turn away. I got up and I walked away. I came back @TIME1 and @CAPS3 was gone. I sat down and talked on the phone for a @CAPS13 @NUM1 I sat and looked at everyone wandering who to talk to because I was bored.

When I got my paper to go in I thought to myself that I wasn't patient couse @CAPS1 seem like I was there for like a cazillion hours.

6,"A long wait   @CAPS1 only four at the time. I had moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didnt care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasnt four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didnt hate the idea but I didnt love it either. Of course. It didnt exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didnt want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. Ive slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I dont get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now Ill get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I cant wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity !"
6,"Have you ever been patient when you didnt want to be? I have! I was @NUM1 @TIME1 and I heard ambulances. I opened my eyes and I seen my living room light on and I heard people talking .I didnt reconvce the peoples voices. @CAPS1 I crawled down from the top bunk of my bunk bed. That I share with my sister, which she was already up. I went straight out into our living room and I seen flashing lights. I walked outside and seen my family by the ambulance .I was the youngest, @CAPS1 they probably didnt want me up. I was being very patient and trying to go through all of the @CAPS2s that were there, with how small I was @NUM2-year old at the time @CAPS1 it was hard for me to understand what was going on. I finally got to my family and my dad was in stretcher, and doctors were surrounding him taking his blood pressure and I asked my mom what was going on and she told me that my dad was having really bad chest pains .@CAPS1 I went and held my dads hand and he told me that they were going to take him to the hospital to see what was wrong with him. @CAPS1 I let his hand go and they drove away. We finally arrived to the hospital and we went into his room and he told us that he had a minor heart attack and they gave him stints. @CAPS1 my family was surrounding him and we were all patient but then I started to get really, really dizzy. @CAPS1 I went over and asked my brother if I would sit down in the chair that he was sitting in, he started to get up but I fainted and hit my head on the brick wall. I wake up after I passed out three times on the ground. They took me and gave me tests and said that I had a concussion from hitting my head but I was very patient for the rest of the time I was there. That was my story about patience."

6,"One sunny afternoon, I was told I had a doctor's appointment schedueled that same day. I wasn't exactly thrilled to hear the news, thrilled to hear the news, because I had a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 planned. In my life, @DATE1 is a difficult time because my scheduele is jammed together. After school was out, my mom picked me up and we started the long drive. I wasn't bored because I kept up a whole conversation with her. I also kept myself occupied by listening to the radio. If you put something in front of me that interests me, you'll have no trouble keeping me patient to wait. When we got to the doctor's office. I was amazed at @CAPS2 many people where waiting their turn. Only then did I realize why doctors and dentists called clients ""patients"". If you didn't have that, you would lose your mind! @CAPS5 I sat down in the comfy chair and waited. Seeing me there, you would've thought I was waiting for the cows to come home. I whipped out my @NUM1 and started listening to music (which was almost out of batteries) instead of the oldies they were playing in the waiting room. Ten minutes had passed, and my @NUM1 shut down. @CAPS5 I got out my only other thing I had brought and played my @CAPS1. A lady sitting across from us asked my mom, ""@CAPS2 does she do it? She'd surely get tired of it?"" And my mom answered,"" she's just a patient person I guess."" @CAPS3 my @CAPS1 shut down too, @CAPS5 I sat and waited. It seemed like days when finally the nurse called my name. I felt like jumping out of my seat, but I didn't want to make a scene. After my doctor's appointment, my mom praised me for being good took at the doctor's and never once complaining. She took me to the store as I had wanted and told me, ""You can pick out whatever you want."" @CAPS5, in the @CAPS6, I had learned a valuable lesson. Not; shut up and you'll get what's coming; but; patience can always be rewarding. The @CAPS6"

Soon enough we were up the stairs and on the @CAPS1 in @CAPS6 time. @CAPS11 at least the waiting is over I said as we rounded a corner.  @CAPS15 what about the hill, @CAPS16 said, The hill is the most suspenseful thing there is. I groaned as I realized he was right half a minute later we were at the @CAPS8. as we arched over the first hill I thought how much it meant to be patent. And for the rest of the ride I enjoyed myself glad to have waited. That is why being patent does pay off in the end."
6,"@ORGANIZATION1 watched the miniscule snowflakes fall outside the foggy windows as she danced in sync with the other girls. It was the week before their ballet performance of the â@CAPS1â and @ORGANIZATION1 couldnât wait to show off her hard work as @LOCATION1, the lead part. AS their dance instructor watched them move gracefully on their toes in a flawless formation, @ORGANIZATION1 focused on smiling wide to show her teacher how professional she was instead of putting all her efforts into her swan-like moves. Just as @ORGANIZATION1 glanced at her instructor to see if she was watching her, she slipped on a single barrette that was limply laying on the floor lost her balance, and fell hard on the floor hearing a loud snap then feeling a bolt of pain throughout her ankle. @ORGANIZATION1 moaned with pain and she sprawled out on the floor, the other girls stopped daring and came rushing towards @CAPS2 side, their formation quickly lost their dance instructor helped her up and sat her on a chair in the corner of the large dance studio while she called her parents to pick her up @PERSON1 was safely out of the dance studio and into the nearest doctorâs office, the pain had grown more unbearable and she would have to stay off of it for at least two weeks which included no dance. @ORGANIZATION1âs heart stopped when she heard this. No dance? No dance meant no practice, and most importantly no @CAPS1. How would someone learn the part of @LOCATION1 in a week? @ORGANIZATION1 was devastated. For the next week, @ORGANIZATION1 was patient, she stayed in bed with her ankle elevated, she didnât go to practice, and she got plenty of rest and drank lots of water. For @ORGANIZATION1 it was hard to be patient with her healing ankle especially when she had to watch the @CAPS1 from the audience instead of on the stage. After the show, @ORGANIZATION1 congratulated the new @LOCATION1 and all the other performers as well in the end, @ORGANIZATION1 was back to practicing daily most importantly she learned the valuable lesson of patience"
6,"Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experience difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do @CAPS11 I did it before. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2, this isnt even moving. @CAPS3 brother and @CAPS3 broter obvousilly wasnt being patient. Hello, @CAPS13 me mame, I mean man, can you walk any shower? @CAPS4, I can if you want me to. A nice man said in a kind friendly voice to @CAPS5. @CAPS6, are you that dumb, I wasnt for real. I m cut you just because of your stupuidity . @CAPS5 said, trying to act all tough. @CAPS5 was only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks hes all big and can di anything he wants. @CAPS8, little man you cant cut me, I was waiting in line forever.: that nice man said to @CAPS5.  well , too bad . while @CAPS3 brother was  making eniesnes, was waiting patiently in line even though the line wasnt really moving, inside I wanted to out every one @CAPS11 not like some people I have patients and can wait. After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didnt get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say, @CAPS8 dont cut me. @CAPS11 that didnt really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person. That person was a young pretty body with beautiful blue eyes and has such pretty blond hair, her name was @PERSON1  @CAPS13 me police man, this  young , little boy just cutter we and every one else. @PERSON1 said. While I was waiting there patiently, @CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole park @CAPS15 in line please,    @CAPS1 thats me . Won.Were was the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard @CAPS11 can be rewarding. I also learned to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerant. Now, @CAPS16 know you get the best when your patient. And the worst when your not."

6,"I remember when I had to be patient. When I tried out for the volleyball team. To see if I was going to make the team or not. Tomorrow is the day of volleyball tryouts. I really wanted to try out. So I did. I was very nervous about if I was going to make the team or not. My mom kept telling me to be patient and that Ill do fine. But that didnt help at all. Wish me luck if I make the team or not. Then finally the day of the tryouts, I was super nervous. When we first went onto the court. They told us to serve, spike, set, and pass. We did all of those things then it was time to leave. When I was leaving I kept thinking. Did I do a good job? Will make the team? I kept asking myself all those question. I was getting more and more impatience. I finally got home, I told my mom everything that I was so nervous. Tomorrow they were going to tell everybody who made the team. I hope I get chosen. Finally I got to school. I couldnt wait the clock was going so slow. I couldnt pay attention in class because I kept worry about the tryouts. Then the bell rang. I grab all of my stuff and ran out the door. Went to my locker grab my backpack and ran towards the gym. I was getting nervous but also anxious to see if I made it or not. I was getting a little impatience. Finally, the coach was coming and started to name all the girls that had made the team. There was only one more name to call and guess whose name it was, mine. It was the most amazing feeling I experience. I was running home and told my mom everything. She was so happy for me and she said that patience is the key. I was so happy and I have to learn a few things about patience. Patience can be a good thing. Just wait."
6,"@CAPS1, @CAPS1, three times seven isnt fifteen. I told my friend @CAPS2. I cant believe I volonterd to tuttor my friend on multiplication. You see my friend is kind of (very) slow at learning things, I was told to work with him once a week on math. Today was the first day and I was already getting upset. I dont know how he survived fouth grade without learning multiplication. A week later he was still making silly math mistakes. Are goal was to get him an A on the big quiz in two weeks. My friend looked up at me and whimperd out, You do think Ill get an A on the big quiz, dont you? I looked at him, yes, why wouldnt I? ked. My friend was roast, probably burnt and I knew it. The day before the test my friend was still not so hot but I knew it was to late to back down now. Right now I knew it was to much to shoot for an A. Now I was hopeing hed pass. Thats all just a plain passing grade. So to make that passing grade happen I made him practice for an extra two hours. I could tell he was getting mad at me. He kept rolling his eyes and muttering to himself but I still didnt give up. After school I invited him over to see his grade on the test. When he got here he had a sad look on his face. Rigt away I looked him on the eyes and cried, oh @CAPS3 Im sorry I knew you worked hard on the test and thats all that matters. All of a sudden he started laughing. He showed me his test it hadt an A on it. You tricked me, I screamed. I didnt know if I should hug him or punch him. That day he gave me a letter. In it was a ten dollar bill. The letter said thanks for your patients. I gave back the money.Seeing the progress I made on my friends grade was reward enough."
6,"Book @CAPS1 And the characters lived happily ever after..for now! @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages were left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results were very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. @CAPS3s wrong! @CAPS11 her mom. @CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish. @CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience said mom. Patience? @CAPS3s that? @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 Patience is when you wait for something, and you dont complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient. @CAPS6 Im waiting said @CAPS7 @CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot. The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. @CAPS9 said @PERSON2. @CAPS3s this? @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 @CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read. @CAPS13 you said @LOCATION1. She couldnt belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait."
6,"One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside this talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said yes. So I went and packed some things to take because they dont have anything. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and was all fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a test saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she this ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said I dont know of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didnt listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didnt work because she didnt talk. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said why. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didnt reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back here. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I dont know why she didnt talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient."
6,"I cannot wait any longer! blurted @PERSON1. @CAPS1 will be out in a second gosh! I explained. This was the day that my friend @PERSON1 and I decided to ride our bikes over to our friend @PERSON2s house. @PERSON1 wasnt patient at all unlike me. The sun smiled down on @ORGANIZATION1. My friend @PERSON1 and I were hanging out with each other all day. I am so bored moaned @PERSON1. @CAPS2 what do you want to do? Anything sounds good at this point. I questioned. She suggested @CAPS4 go for a walk and I blurted out anything but that! @CAPS4 sat in that quiet grassy field for about fifteen minutes, just thinking. @CAPS3, how about @CAPS4 go to @PERSON2s? I blurted out. ugh fine, lets go. @CAPS4 took our rusty bikes and peddled over to @PERSON2s house, and knocked on his big, red, door. There stood @PERSON2, small and thin, clean long brown hair, freckles all over his face, and a cheesey grin to top it off. @CAPS4 asked if @CAPS1 wanted to come outside, and hang out. Ill be out in a couple minutes @CAPS1 replied. @CAPS4 tumbled down the stairs and set in his yard. About four minutes later, @PERSON1 starts asking tons of questions, but one specific one when is @CAPS1 gonna get out here?! I do not know! I yelled. I am not god! @CAPS5, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning she exhaled. Now it has been about twenty minutes since @CAPS1 had been inside. @PERSON1 was loosing it, I was perfectly fine. She ran up the stairs and knocked on the door like she was big, bad, wolf. @PERSON2 opened the door with one hand, and had a sand witch in the other. your eating! she screamed. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 replied I was starving oh my gosh I have been waiting forever! she yelled. @PERSON2 shuts the door and gets a glass of lemonade. Only patient people get some as @CAPS1 handed me a glass. I started laughing, I am so glad I was patient!"
6,"In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didnt get to sleep in very much, I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasnt going with us. We got in the car, and drove to my uncle @PERSON1s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching  the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. @CAPS1 my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight."
7,"  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a and @CAPS1. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5-@CAPS6, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter."
7," It all began when my best guy friend @CAPS9 the time asked @CAPS7 to go to the lake that @DATE1 with a bunch of people , I mean how could I turn that down getting tan with friends, swimming I mean it sounded fun in all so I decided to say yes @CAPS5 really fast too. I was sitting on the couch when all the sudden my phone started ringing I hurried to pick it up.. it was @PERSON2 "" @PERSON1... @PERSON2 said "" ""yeah, whats up "" ""your coming right tomorrow right.. @PERSON2 continued """"yeah, of course what time though.""  ""@CAPS2 going to be @CAPS9 your house @CAPS9 @NUM1 be ready @CAPS2 being @NUM2 exlaimed"" "" alright alright ,ill see you tomorrow.. @CAPS3 I hung up the phone.""  The next day I layed in bed wide awake @CAPS9 @TIME1 @CAPS5 was unable to even think about sleeping any more I was so excited I had that feeling where I just knew it was going to be a good day @CAPS5 knew it was going to be so much fun. Nine o clock came faster @CAPS3 ever, I jumped out of bed @CAPS5 went straight to the bathroom to get ready, @CAPS5 begin packing my beach bag. @CAPS3 finally @NUM1 rolled around, @CAPS5 my phone started going off agin @CAPS5 it was @PERSON2 "" you ready!? were outside your house .. @PERSON2 said"" ""yep, @CAPS2 coming right now..bye "" I got in the car with it jamed full of guys @CAPS5 we took off.   @CAPS9 about two o clock we got to the lake @CAPS5 all began getting out of the car @CAPS5 started stretching @CAPS3 @CAPS3 all the boys started stripping off their clothes until just there swimming shorts @CAPS5 @CAPS3 all started running right towards the water @CAPS5 all hopped in. So right away I began taking my clothes off so now all I had on was my swimsuit @CAPS3 I stared walking down too. Finally @PERSON2 comes up @CAPS5 starts telling @CAPS7 to hurry "" @CAPS1'mon @PERSON1 hurry it up run I want you to get in..."" "" I know @CAPS2 coming.. @CAPS5 @CAPS2 going to get in dont worry @PERSON2.. "" @CAPS3 out of no where @PERSON2 grabes my hand @CAPS5 begins making @CAPS7 run down towards the water. When all the sudden we hit this like muddy patch of walk way area that looked like bird poop @CAPS5 mud mixed together. As soon as my feet hit the mud , while I was running I slipped @CAPS5 fell right in front of the guy I liked @CAPS9 the time ""@PERSON2"". I had never been more embarrassed in life, but I played it out cool, @CAPS5 since everyone else was laughing @CAPS9 @CAPS7 I decided to start laughing too. @CAPS3 I notcied that once everyone had stopped laughing no one really cared enough to make it that big of deal. So I hopped back up with the help of @PERSON2's hand @CAPS5 @CAPS3 notcied that since I had just slipped in mud/poop that it was all over the butt. @CAPS9 that point I dont think I could have been more embarrassed about what had just happened..I had slipped in mud, @CAPS5 it was all over @CAPS7. After that had happen I didnt really care anymore about being embarrassed, so I walked on down to the water @CAPS5 got in right away @CAPS5 swam around a little bit so that the mud would wash away, @CAPS5 thank @CAPS4 it did. About twenty mintues later were all sitting in the sand @CAPS5 just telling stories @CAPS5 hanging out, when @PERSON2 looks over in the water @CAPS5 notices that there is a huge ""water slug"" in the water right by him, so him being a guy, he decides to go over @CAPS5 grab the slug @CAPS5 hold on to it, @CAPS5 of course.. I freak out @CAPS5 get up @CAPS5 kind of take a few steps back. @PERSON2 starts asking "" @CAPS5 who do I want to throgh this @CAPS9"" everyone @CAPS9 the point is saying "" not @CAPS7.. NOT @CAPS7"". I just stood there quit, when he looks over @CAPS9 @CAPS7 I stare back @CAPS9 him with a scared look on my face @CAPS5 say "" @CAPS5 you wouldnt through that @CAPS9 @CAPS7 becauase @CAPS2 a good friend of yours right?.. now would you."" @CAPS9 this point since right before this we were all sitting in the sand talking,I had put on a tank top @CAPS5 shorts over my swin suit, when all the sudden I hear "" @PERSON1 watch out"" I had turned around for a second... @CAPS9 the most, to look @CAPS9 something, @CAPS3 I feel this slimy long wet thing side down my shirt. I look down my shirt @CAPS5 see this slug in side of my shirt. I start freaking out @CAPS5 screaming as loud as I could @CAPS5 jumping around. @CAPS5 just when I thought it was out I look down @CAPS5 its still there finally it comes popping out of my shirt, @CAPS5 I just sat there calming down from what juast happend. Oh what a day!!"
7," Laughter is something that you should make an important part of your everyday life. In most cases laughter can brake the ice and can make people more comfortable with each other. When with friends and family most likely some of your best memory are made when there is something going on that made you laugh. Laughing not only puts yourself in a good mood but also every one around you. When you can make everyone laugh and put people in a good mood, in most cases you will be viewed as a fun, self confident person.  In the scorching @DATE1 my cousin @PERSON4, myself and two of his friends I had not met yet planned a camping trip. Our idea was that we are going down to the river about two miles away from @CAPS1 house and camp out for @NUM1 nights. We planed to make time the second day for us all to hike up the beautiful river to the falls for the day. When we first arrived i met is friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. We where all busy the first few hours setting up camp. Once camp was set up we made a fire and sat around it. The evening was awkward and silent for a short time because none of us other than @PERSON4 knew each other. Things started to get better when @PERSON4 started telling everyone about the prank war me and him had been having over the past few months. @CAPS2 started  "" this whole thing started when @PERSON1 put plastic wrap outside of my door so I ran in to it when i woke up in the morning."" I interrupted. "" no actually this started because @PERSON4 called me short and made fun of me, I cant help that im not tall.""  @CAPS2 continued his story about all the pranks we had pulled on each other like how i put butter all over his kitchen floor, then called his house phone so when @CAPS2 ran in there to answer it @CAPS2 slipped. @CAPS2 told of how @CAPS2 put his snake in my bed and scared me and how @CAPS2 filled my bathtub with green jello. After some good laughs we all warmed up and started talking and telling our own stories. Later that day we all went down to the river. @PERSON4 saw a small lime green frog and picked it up. @CAPS2 held it up to my face and said  "" kiss it @PERSON1 maybe it will turn in to a prince! "", I said "" no way dude im not going to kiss a frog"" @CAPS2 replied with "" and this is why you will never find true love @PERSON1 i mean you got to take a chance now and then you know.""I told him that I had a prince and @CAPS2 was much more handsome then the frog could ever become.  After a good time at the river we went back up to camp and ate dinner and talked some more around the fire. That night @PERSON4 broke the zipper on his tent so lucky me I had to share my tent with him. After everyone went to bed we went out of the tent and where getting something to eat when @PERSON4 said ""whoa did you see that!"" as @CAPS2 quickly looked up at the sky. Naturally I looked up and said ""what is it."" @CAPS2 just laughed at me because there was nothing there @CAPS2 just wanted me to look.  The next morning after breakfast me, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 all went down to the river again and jumped in. @PERSON4 soon joined us. I noticed that there was a bunch of small fish in the water and i pointed them out to @PERSON4. The first thing @CAPS2 said was ""if you can catch one of those with your hands ill eat it hole"" I said ""your on"" so I struggled in the water trying to catch a little fish for around @NUM2 minutes. This whole time the guys are having fun laughing at me struggle and get all wet trying to catch the little fish. Finlay I got one! I walked over to @PERSON4 with the fish in my hand and smiled. @CAPS2 grabbed it out of my hand and put it in his mouth and swallow it, @CAPS2 quickly grabbed my hand and put it on his throat. I could feel the fish wiggling down his neck. I thought it was gross but then very funny because i didn't really expect him to do it.  The rest of the @ORGANIZATION1 consisted of some good laughs and some good memory's made. @PERSON2 somehow got coal from the fire on his forehead and we all giggled knowing @CAPS2 had no idea it was there for about @NUM1 hours. I caught @PERSON3 singing and dancing to himself by the river one evening, it was pretty hilarious but I kept that one to myself. Over all the camping trip was one of the best. I had a great time and made some new friends. It is truly an experience I will not soon forget."
7," @CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head rose up, the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self, and @CAPS2 spoke to the person who always sat to his left. "" @CAPS1 just don't understand @PERSON2"" the broken, voice cracked on words ""I don't care that @CAPS1 play in cascade winds or that @CAPS1 get private lessons or that @CAPS1've gone to state honor band! This @MONTH1 sound like a terrible reason, but i just want to play first because i want to play first, and @CAPS1 never let us play first."" @CAPS2 was right about one thing, @PERSON2 really never let us play first. I somehow understood where @CAPS3 was coming from; @CAPS4 my freshman year i had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short @CAPS3's four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  @PERSON2 was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove @CAPS6. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to @LOCATION1 as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS6 was my sense of wanting superiority as well. @PERSON2 took in the words, leaned closer to say. "" I understand that @CAPS1 want first"" @CAPS10 with confident tones she said ""but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part. I understand what your feeling, ive been there before.""  @CAPS6 struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what @CAPS2 was feeling? she'd been a prodigy child in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 from the start. I sided with @PERSON1 but @CAPS10 I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So i tried siding with @PERSON2 but @CAPS10 all i could think about was that this was @PERSON1's last year to shine as a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 french horn player.They kept going at eachother. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. @CAPS9 the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co-operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. ""@CAPS9 a man has no socks,"" I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "" @CAPS10 so will..."".And that's as far as i got. I thought @CAPS6 was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled @CAPS10 they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say. @CAPS3 stopped crying, finally, and @PERSON2 got my message that @CAPS3 was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; @CAPS3 would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as @CAPS6 gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I cant even begin to imagine what band would be like @CAPS9 their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so @CAPS7 @CAPS6 made @CAPS6 hard to breath right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip eachother's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fighing. Either way, @CAPS6's definatley changed the way they feel about eachother; I haven't heard them complian about one another for a while. @CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @PERSON2 for better or worse can't wait to see him play."
7," Growing up with both of my parents and having my dads parents (my grandparents) has been the best thing for me. I spent a ton of time at my grandparents house when I was @CAPS3. Every @DATE1 we got out of @CAPS1 an hour early. And every @DATE1 of elementary school, my grandpa would be waiting for me to get out of school. He would pick me up and then we would go to either @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS2's for lunch. I always wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 because they had a play structure. But growing up, I became really close with my grandma and grandpa. My parents didn't need to worry about babysitters because we always had my grandparents that would take care of me. So the bond with them just got stronger and stronger. I would always do my homework with my grandma, and then when I was done I would go out with my grandpa and do yard work or tinker on something in the garage. A lot of what I know now was taught to me by my grandparents. I was a very lucky @CAPS3 @CAPS5 to grow up having them in my life. Doing yard work with my @CAPS6 (which is what I called my grandpa when I was @CAPS3) was actually fun. I loved yard work. He taught me how to use the riding lawn mower at a very young age. So by the time i was @NUM1 years old I could start it up, mow the lawn, empty the grass from the catcher, and put the mower back in the garage when I was done without any help. Well one sunny @DATE2 day, when I finished mowing the lawn my grandpa was sitting on the patio drinking @NUM2, like always. So I grabbed myself one and went and joined him because that is where he always sat and watched me mow the lawn and that's where we always hung out together. We're sitting there just talking, and he asks me if I hooked the hose back up to the fosit. Well of course I didn't because I wanted to go sit on the patio with my @CAPS6. So him and I walked over to the fosit to hook it back up. But for whatever reason he told me to take the nozzle end out to some flowers. Now here is a @NUM1 year old kid standing behind his @CAPS6 with the nozzle end of a hose with @CAPS6 bending over in front of me. So I did what any other @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 would do. I held the nozzle up, aimed right at that big booty of his, and pulled the trigger. After about a good @NUM4 second soaking of his bum, I dropped the nozzle and ran as fast as I could to my grandma. And when I got to her she was wondering why I was so scared. Well all I would say was, ""@CAPS6 is gonna kill me!"". Here comes @CAPS6 walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and I were standing. He had just the most straight angry look on this face. I literally thought that my butt was going to hurt forever after he spanked me. And so there the @NUM5 of us were standing there. Me thinking that I'm going to die. And all of the sudden my grandpa gets the biggest smile on his face and both him and my grandma start cracking up. He wasn't mad, he thought it was hilarious! So of course I start laughing too!  @CAPS6 came inside and changed his now water soaked pants and underwear and then all @NUM5 of us went out on the patio and just chilled and talked and drank some great @NUM2. After a couple hours of relaxing with the best grandparents in the world, my grandma went inside to make dinner. So @CAPS6 and I stayed out on the patio and shot pine cones out of the tree with a @CAPS7 gun, seeing who could shoot more down before dinner was ready. Grandma called us in for dinner. And that night was one of the best dinners that I ever had with my grandparents, because all we did was eat, and laugh, and eat, and laugh, and eat a @CAPS3 more, and laugh a @CAPS3 more! Well @CAPS6 and I had a tradition that was started when I was old enough to talk, drink root beer floats and watch @CAPS8's together. And from that night on to the day he died, my best friend was my @CAPS6. He passed away about a year ago. Life hasn't been the same since then. But when he passed he left me his truck. Every morning when I get in and start it up, the sound of the engine just brings back memories of him and I. The sound of the blinker even brings some memories too.  But I know that everyday he looks down on me and thinks back to all of the good times that we had. Ah, how I miss the good times."
7,"           NARRATIVE!         One night I was sitting on my couch and my cell phone began to ring and it was my cousin that I have not seen or talk to in four years, and I answered it my cousin was like "" oh my gosh you have to come here to wunderland arcade"" and I was like what? she was like yeah I'm down here with my mom and my two sisters and my brother. So I asked my mom nicely and she agreed thank gosh! I was calling her and calling her and no answer, so I started to get angry and I slammed my phone down on the hard concrete and my battery came out and I was freaking out like super bad and the light almost changed I grabbed my things and I ran didn't see where I was going but I hit a moving car. How stupid can that be, there was no need to rush I live across the street from the arcade and I was rushing for no reason like I was gonna miss her and for the final time that I called her she answered and her and I were talking for three minutes until I didn't see what I was doing again and ran into the back of someone's car. So as quickly as I can I ran super fast, she was like what happened to your eye and I was like what are you talking about and I didn't realized that my eye was a different color. I'm freaking out what am I going to do. @ORGANIZATION1 my cousin was like chill it's okay and I give her this look like you seriously want me to relax when my eye looks like this as I pointed to my eye, she says um okay we can fix this and she takes a lot of eyeliner and starts to put a whole bunch of black stuff on my eyes and it made me look like I got punched in the eyes or we call it raccoon eyes. When I looked in that mirror for the first time I slapped her so hard I thought she had a bloody nose and she came back at me by pulling my hair and slamming my head against the bathroom counter and laughed look who is the wimp around her and as she said that I turned around and back handed her and screamed so loud I thought my mom can hear me from our house. @ORGANIZATION1's mother had to come in the bathroom pull each other off one another she said this is a public place gosh darn it and if you guys cant respect that then we will just go home and @ORGANIZATION1 and I didn't like the idea of going home so early. We said we were sorry to each other and ran to go play games when we got back into it and she thought it was funny to push me off the video game I was playing and make me lose, so I got my evil look on and as she was walking I tripped her and made her so mad that that I thought her head was gonna explode and that was the last time that I tripped my cousin in an arcade again and her mom was so mad that we all had to leave and @ORGANIZATION1 got grounded but I didn't get grounded cause my mom didn't know nothing about anything and I plan on not telling my mother what really happened at the arcade because that means I would not leave my house for weeks and honestly I can't stand my family at all yes there family but they drive me into the nut house or something. My mom thinks I do everything bad which makes me laugh because I do everything good until @DATE1 fools day when I do twisted and evil stuff to everyone in my house hold and how they got me back was they put my cousin in my room and told @ORGANIZATION1 that I said something bad about her and I opened my door and @ORGANIZATION1 came at me with full force and my family was laughing so hard that they were going to pee there pants and I was still fighting my cousin, no help or anything and @ORGANIZATION1 weighs a lot and I weigh a hundred and ten pounds and she like a hundred and thirty pounds. I had only one escape my window I opened that window and flung out and ran as fast as I could till I got to the end of the street and without looking I thought to myself that there's no cars why not cross and I'm so stupid and crossed and my family's friend hit me with there new bought car. They felt so bad that they hit me with there car and I wish that I wouldn't do something stupid and cross the street without looking first, but my mom and step dad came down the street with a look on there faces. funny :)"
7,"@CAPS4 fills the air around us with happiness and joy, @CAPS4 brings warm memory's of loved ones that are close to us , and adds a splash of hope to those who need @CAPS4. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems.@CAPS4 is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life .Laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you,@CAPS4 could be brought up by a show, and @CAPS4 could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returning home from a long journey. Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole , the moment right when that happens you hear your self laughing as hard as you can that you practically cant breath and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh. Although @CAPS3 might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you. @CAPS3 is how friendships are brought up and made, just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between to people that could either last a minute or can last a life time. In my case @CAPS3 is how I met one of my closest friend ever , we had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the @ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his own personal home made flag ( he got the @CAPS1 off of a show ) ,as he was heading up the pole almost half way their he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help, a minute later the faculty members finally heard his cry's and yells and tried to get him down from ware he was, @CAPS4 took them almost half an hour to get him down. @CAPS3 was the moment ware I had made one of the greatest friendship I've ever had in my life. Many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other. God laugh's last. @CAPS3 is the name of @PERSON1 son of @CAPS2 and @PERSON2. In @CAPS3 story @PERSON2 the @CAPS5 of @PERSON1 claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news. Being surprised or shocked can also bring some one to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did them self's. I remembered a time ware I laughed at something that took me by surprise, @CAPS4 was when my @CAPS5 lost the keys to the house inside the car, we looked for them every ware but had no luck finding them, after an hour had pass we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house, after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my @CAPS5 found the key that she lost inside her pocket (@CAPS4 was a typical cartoon moment).When we heard the news we all just started laughing at what has just happen, we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see being surprise can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someones face. Picture yourself staring into the eyes of some one close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing nonstop for no reason. That is basically an every day thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't stare at each other for even a minute, we eventually start laughing the first five seconds and end up laughing a hole hour without stop, but as soon as we stop laughing we note's that we were laughing for no apparent reason , which would make us laugh for another hour more.That the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get , the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all.@CAPS3 shows the connection two people have with each other the type ware you know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memory's of family gatherings for the holidays , friendships we made when we were in school , memory's of our childhood and how thing we thought then were in style and cool are k now thing we look back into and laugh at, by being a little surprise, and can also be The fact that we know someone by heart ."
7," The human brain is a piece of work. Its the kingdom to our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it wants to. Its really something else. One of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor. Laughter. The ability to not take life to seriously for a moment. That light switch in @CAPS7 body that causes @CAPS7 brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world. Scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people that finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the people having a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe its our gnarly facial expressions we exchange one another, or we @MONTH1 just be funny looking. Either way we have a sense of humor. That's @CAPS4 life is about, @CAPS1 @CAPS7 happiness with people who fill @CAPS7 life with joy. @PERSON1 said, ""live simply, so that others can simply live."" I @CAPS9 we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year a couple friends and I went to mission ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made, our own hotel suite with two king sized beds and a plasma @CAPS2. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @PERSON3 on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON2 was eating a bag of pop corn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. ""@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea."" @PERSON2 whispered over to me. ""@CAPS4?"" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word @PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 tooth paste, a sack of coins and a package of peach rings. ""I had nothing to do with this."" I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON2 began squirting out tooth paste onto @PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and penny's into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. ""@CAPS5 is going to kill you."" I gasped. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 wont! It will be hilarious."" @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON2 then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION1's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON2 intended on. ""@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes. @CAPS5 was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried tooth paste. Quarters, dimes and penny's drilled into his skin and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS5 stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON2 turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. ""@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?"" @PERSON2 questioned, confused. @PERSON3 grew closer to @PERSON2, she backed away slowly, not quite sure @CAPS4 his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON3 across the room by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle over his head. ""@CAPS9 fast."" @PERSON3 shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS5 could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. But sadly, @PERSON2 ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON2's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2 and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 still crusted over, @PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all starred at each other without a word. everything was fine. It then occurred to me that @CAPS6 matter @CAPS4 we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. Its that one value in life we can cherish forever."
7," The first day I met her, I knew @CAPS4 was the right dog for me. Her black and white fur was as soft as cotton, and her eyes as brown as the bark on a tree. @CAPS4 had a genuine personality no other dog could possess. Which was something I could tell right away @CAPS4 was the dog for me. Over the next couple of months, our friendship grew, as I taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab @PERSON1, instantly became her best friend, as the two ran over the property barking and playing. Everynight the two would cuddle up next to eachother and sleep. The times @CAPS1 (my new dog) would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo. Her middle belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a large-breathing oreo @CAPS1. @CAPS5 her name had come from. The seventh month had came along fast, but it was enjoyable every day with my @CAPS1 at my side.@CAPS4 gave me the best comfort when I needed it, always giving me a smile when the day was rainy, or sleeping next to me when I didnt feel the best. It was kind of like @CAPS4 was my own special dose of medicine, her presence made me feel well again. Her love had grown deep into all of our hearts at that house and @CAPS4 was one of a kind, but something began to change about her as the days went on. Her food bowl would be nearly full everytime we fed her, @CAPS4 wouldnt run with @PERSON1 anymore, @CAPS4 wouldnt talk, and @CAPS4 wouldnt smile. I knew something was wrong. We didnt know @CAPS4 was sick until it was too late. The first day @CAPS4 had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but none of us had the money to do it. The second day in the @TIME1, I couldnt find @CAPS1 anywhere on the property. I thought that maybe @CAPS4 had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. Panick spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1,"" I looked at her straight into her eyes, ""I know you can hear me."" @CAPS4 looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. ""@CAPS5 is @CAPS1, @PERSON1?"" I knew @CAPS4 understood me as @CAPS4 began to sniff around the areas of the property and suddenly as if @CAPS4 had picked up a trace, had followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON1 wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car. There @CAPS1 was sick looking. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriends mother to look at her. We werent sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called a animal expert and asked. @CAPS4 said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadnt gotten @CAPS1 her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up shooting water into her dehydrated body, and spinach juice hoping it would help, but all @CAPS4 wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the @TIME1. In the @TIME1 my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with @CAPS1 to take care of her. I sang songs to her as @CAPS4 layed on the porch sad looking and in despair, I stroked her on her head telling her how much @CAPS4 was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat but @CAPS4 would only puke it back up. Finally after a day of crying next to her I noticed @CAPS4 kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the insentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, i noticed a large bloody hole @CAPS5 flies were flying out of. @CAPS4 was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her watching her be in pain. It was time. As soon as we got to the vet office, they took her inside and layed her on a table @CAPS5 I was told to hold onto her as they shot an overdose of anasthesia into her. it was only seconds before @CAPS4 was gone and everyone in the room was silent and I cried over her limp no longer smiling body.  We dug a hole and buried her under the tree @CAPS4 played under. ""@CAPS1 my mama bear. @NUM2 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 you in heaven."""
7," What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" @CAPS2 and there @CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. @CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but @CAPS2 again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, @CAPS3 learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself."
7," My best friend and I have been friends since third grade. We've shared many laughs, memories, and tears, yet to this day we're still closer than ever. One of the key reasons we've been able to stay friends for so long is because we make each other laugh. We joke around and we make any boring time into a good one. This is the story of how our relationship came to be and some of the reasons why we are still best friends. It started in third grade. I was walking alone on the playground when she asked me to play with her, having nothing else to do, I agreed. We played for the whole recess, and it eventually became a regular thing for us to spend recess together. The first time she invited me to her house, I was kind of nervous. I was afraid it was going to be awkward, or that we wouldn't have a good time. When we got to her house after school, we went to her room, played video games for a little bit, and then we had a snack. We brought our crackers to her room, sat on the ground, and started to eat. Out of no where we just looked at each other, and we started laughing like crazy. They weren't little giggles either, we laughed so hard it brought tears to our eyes. From that day forward we hung out as often as we could. A couple of years went by, we hung out more often, and declared ourselves best friends. When fifth grade came around, we were glued to the hip. Her dad was our teacher, so he already knew how close we both were. We never really got to sit next to each other, but we still managed to talk a lot. One day at recess we were joking around and she said your butt is so big, you're going to break a chair. These days it doesn't seem that funny, but in fifth grade it was hilarious. When we got inside we played this math game, I got the question wrong so I plopped down in my chair, sure enough, it broke. Other kids that heard what she said laughed, but no one really quite laughed as much as we both did.  Fifth grade was also when boys started coming into the picture. During @DATE1 break she really liked this one guy, and when he said he didn't like her, she was completely broken. That night she came over to talk with me about it, but we never ended up talking about it at all. Instead, we watched funny movies and I would do things on purpose to make her laugh. Even though we were already really close, that night made us grow even closer. At the end of fifth grade we had a little graduation ceremony. Towards the end they put on a slide show of everyone in the fifth grade class. One of the pictures was of @PERSON1 and I with mud masks on, we were both embarrassed, but we also laughed because we had a lot of fun that night, and we wondered how the picture got on the slide show. After the ceremony @PERSON1 and I threw a party. We shared many laughs and still that made us grow even closer, even though we had made new friends that night, our bond was unbreakable. Middle school was a whole new experience. New friends, different classes, and more drama. I hate to say it, but we grew apart those three years. We had none of the same classes and we both met new people, but every time I went over to her house, or every time we hung out, we laughed till we were crying, and gasping for air. A lot of things happened, our different friends fought, some of them moved, but our ability to make each other laugh kept us together through thick and thin. Towards the end of our middle school lives, we grew closer again, and things were pretty much back to normal.  Today @PERSON1 and I are as close as we were in fifth grade if not closer. When we are together not only do we make ourselves laugh, but we make other people laugh as well. We are together almost every weekend, and we @MONTH1 not do much, but we always end up laughing like crazy. Doing cheer, we also spend even more time together. Other things in our relationship are important too, like trust, loyalty, and kindness, but laughter is what has kept us together through everything we have been through. Laughter is also the reason we have become friends in the first place and I am happy to call her my best friend. Without her, my life would be very boring, and I hope we stay friends for the rest of our lives. Laughing keeps people together and makes relationships grow stronger. This was an example of how it helped me and my best friend become friends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us."
7," I think laughter is good for a relationships and here is why . When I first got to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i was trying to be myself and make friends. One day I was in class and @CAPS4 came into my class room and came up to me and she started talking to me and I started laughing .The she told me that she liked my laugh so she stared laughing like me. So that I would laugh more an @CAPS5 felt good knowing that she was making fun of my laugh she was enjoying @CAPS5 . She was trying to get me to laugh cause she thought @CAPS5 was funny because she had never heard anyone laugh like that. Everyone has a different laugh i have two laughs which she found out funny . @CAPS5 was the best day of my life because i was being myself and I know she wasn't laughing at me. Every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so that she can laugh and we all have a good time. For me @CAPS5 is funny because lot's of people don't notice how other people laugh.  @CAPS5 feel good that she noticed and liked @CAPS5 and wanted to have a good time. Most people when they make fun of someone they say hurtful things @CAPS4 wanted to make me laugh again i know she wasn't making fun of me. She just thought @CAPS5 was unique and funny but not a haha you are weird funny but like a omg i love your laugh, its cute and funny. Now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh @CAPS5 makes me feel good every time she does @CAPS5.When you are new at @CAPS3 good to make other people laugh specially when its not at you directly. To be honest @CAPS5 made me feel like people were startling to like me and not knowing me as ""the new kid"" but as a human being an actual person and that they say me for me not for what i wanna be or for what people see me as. That's all i could really ask for. So my opinion is yes laughter is good for relationships @CAPS5 shows that you have a sense of humor and that there is a actual person inside that body not just bones.  Another reason is @CAPS5 shows your personalty your real self. Isn't that what people, to want people to see them for who they are not what people say there are.At least that's what i want. that's why i will never forget that class period. @CAPS4 showed me that if i just laugh with other people ill know that the aren't laughing at me like making fun of me they are saying that i am funny. That's what people want is to see people for who they are.  The teacher was a substitute for that day and she kept on getting mad at us for laughing but we couldn't help @CAPS5 because @CAPS5 was so funny. That period i laughed the whole time. I was laughing so @CAPS8 that i peed my pants a little. She made fish faces and sounds like she pretended to be a monkey in a tree. She laughed how I laugh she did everything to make me laugh. @CAPS5 was so funny @CAPS5 took up the whole period. That's is how much i was laughing.  I got up and was going to go to the bathroom and when i got back she was still there and i sat down and so she started making me laugh. So then i sat down and @CAPS7 and @PERSON1 came in and there was something in his pocket and i poked at @CAPS5 and said what is that its @CAPS8. We all started laughing cause @CAPS5 was funny @CAPS5 was is wallet. I didn't get why they were still laughing when I stopped but then I continued to still laugh because the way they were laughing. We all were laughing and then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing cause @CAPS5 was funny.The sub came and stood there by us and we all got quit and then started laughing again. I think that the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing dumb stuff. I turned around to do my work and then @CAPS4 spinned me around so that i would start laughing again. Then i started laughing again @CAPS5 I started crying. I was laughing so @CAPS8. @CAPS4 started laughing so @CAPS8 that she started laughing. At the end of the period I had to pee so bad. @CAPS4 wouldn't let me go she just kept on making me laugh more and more. Sometimes just laughing for no reason is the most fun. I guss my whole belief is that laughter is one of the best things that a person can do. Not only is @CAPS5 fun but @CAPS5 is also a very healthy thing to do."
7,"  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart."
7," The thought of seeing him and hearing his laugh never failed to make me smile. I was beginning to accept the fact that this was an urge I couldn't fight anymore. His sense of humor was the best I had encountered and it made my heart run wild. To me, the best piece of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little things that make that person who they are. A trait I always search for is someones humor and when I can easily find it, I thrive on it. My story takes place nearly a year ago, while my freshmen school year was coming to an end. I had a suitcase of new memories I planned to carry with with me, but one more was still to be added. I strolled into art class merely @NUM1 seconds late on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air, something I had come accustom to. Instinct told me to take my seat, so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus. A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me. ""@CAPS1 to go! You're late."" @CAPS2 the teacher had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but to laugh at myself as well. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a smile as class began.  The teacher went on about art related topics that I was far beyond, so by habit I vaguely payed any attention. I was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me. I had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him. We barley said a few words on that day of class. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place. It had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned into the room took his seat. @CAPS2 what I had forgotten made me excited. Today was a free work day, a time to be social and work at our own pace. Perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art. I casually introduced myself, trying to fit personality into my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. Him being uninterested made me thrive to try harder. I began to be myself and act as if I had known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then I had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing. By the end of that day I hadn't finished any of the work I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an alluring new person.  Each day went on similarly but I had taught myself a good balance of work and talk. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in. I'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny I found him because of how often my laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and each hysterical thing he said. After a couple weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he made the decision to give me a call. I intrigued him as well. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations. More time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often. I no longer needed to act as if I had known him for years. It was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me. Although, along with familiarity came a sense of question. I was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return. I would tell him something of my past and he would make a joke of it; I would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days, but it was coming time to feel more then pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to tell him personal things, but get something from him too. I began to realize I was digging deep into shallow waters.  The amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything more then simple things. I still wished to have him be apart of my life, to still enjoy his company, but I had no need to dig deeper. It was time for me find new waters to swim in."
7,"Have @CAPS1 ever had that one friend who was your best friend, that @CAPS1 could go to for anything, that @CAPS1 were so close to that @CAPS1 guys knew everything about each other, from the way their nose flared when they laughed to their deepest darkest secret. Well @PERSON2 was that type of best friend to me. Us two crazy monkeys became friends in first grade. We were never the type of girls to sit down in class and read a book or stay calm all throughout school, no, we were the girls playing sports with the boys, getting dirty and scratched up. We always were laughing and playing and having a great time. Laughter was a big part of our friendship because,well, we were always laughing. We would get in trouble for keeping our parents up late at @TIME2 with our crazy jokes, loud laughing, and hyper psychotic ninja adventures we would take during the middle of the @TIME2. No matter what we were doing, we could always make a joke out of it all. "" @CAPS1 guys are perfect together"" said my mom one day, and all I had to say in reply to that was "" I know, we are two monkey ninjas.""  @PERSON2 and I had this one restaurant that we loved to go to, it was @PERSON1 @PERSON1. @CAPS2, @PERSON2 s @CAPS5 would take us to there at least twice a month and we would always get the same exact thing every single time. @PERSON2 and I could make some things funny that no one else understood. We would sit there in the booth with @CAPS2 and talk about the funny times, the stupid fights, and end up laughing uncontrollably throughout the time we were at @ORGANIZATION1. It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1, @PERSON2 had come over to my house and was planning on spending the @TIME2. We had our whole @TIME2 planned out, we were going to call her @CAPS5 and talk him into taking us to @PERSON1, and when we got back home we were going to go on a jog, then get ready to go on an ""adventure"" is what we liked to call them. So we called @CAPS2 and had creatively talked him into taking us. But the catch was, was that we had to go over to @LOCATION1 s house mow the yard, plant some plants, weed some of the garden and then he would take us. So we went of course and did all the work that we agreed on doing, and we went to @ORGANIZATION1, dirty, sweaty, and exhausted. By this time everyone at @ORGANIZATION1 knew our names by heart. We made jokes with them and sometimes even got to go in the back room and get our ranch if there wasn't too many people there. We ate our food, got extra fries, extra ranch, and were sitting there with full bellies. We were all ready to leave, but @CAPS2 had to go to the bathroom. So @PERSON2 and I sat there and waited while he was in the restroom. He was taking a longer amount of time than he usually does, which was fine with us because we wanted to talk about this one boy that @PERSON2 was having a ""thing"" with, which we couldn't talk about while her @CAPS5 was around. Finally he comes out of the bathroom, and i notice his zipper is down but he is so close I didn't want to say anything to @PERSON2 about it until we were further away from him, and him being in his playful hyper mood wouldn't let us get far enough away from him so I could tell her. As we were walking out of the door, I finally told @PERSON2 to tell her @CAPS5 that his zipper was down. So as she turns and looks she bursts out into laughter because while his zipper is down he is talking to a group of people that work there. So as we are both laughing hysterically we are trying to tell him. We finally got him to start walking out of the door, and at that time @PERSON2 says between giggles "" @CAPS5 your zipper is down,"" he looks down and does his nervous/oh my goodness laugh and zips it up.  The whole ride home, @PERSON2 and I are busting a nut laughing as hard as we could. Our stomachs were about to explode because of laughing so hard. @CAPS2 was in the front seat occasionally giggling because he couldn't believe that his zipper was down the whole time. And as we were nearing my house he says "" there was a song playing, and I wanted to hurry and write the lyrics before they were over, I really liked that song ."" That to me, was the funniest thing @CAPS2 ever said. @CAPS2 went home and bought the song on i @CAPS7, and also learned to check his zipper more often. @PERSON2 is the perfect best friend for me, we are just a like in many ways. But our sense of humor is the most alike."
7," The new trimester had started and leadership was my second period. With no idea of what the responsibilities of a leadership student were, I was skeptical on taking the class. After days of taking the class, I began to enjoy it more and more. After a week or so, the teacher announced we would be on stage helping set up and organize the upcoming assembly. I had never done anything of the sort so I was somewhat excited. Days went by and the entire class practiced setting up the assembly, running to our places, moving props, and stacking chairs. The day of the assembly finally arrived, it was time for the show. The students poured into their seats as we scurried around behind the curtains. Everything was set up perfectly. The curtains rose and the assembly began. My peers and I stood behind the stage watching the assembly unfold. The school band preformed a long boring set of songs, the curtains fell and the entire leadership class ran out on stage, picked up and stacked the chairs that the band just used. After, we all ran to get the bleachers and dragged them out to the front of the stage. The choir was now going to preform, we then retreated back behind the curtains.  The choir sang their songs, and we watched, but as they proceeded to set up for their last song, students moved around leaving a large open spot in the top row. With the choirs last song, they preformed a simple swaying dance to go along with their song. My leadership class friends and I, noticed this large open spot in the choir and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance. However, none of us had enough courage to do it. The choir finished their song and dance, the first assembly was over. We then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly. It was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be preformed again. The students came in, sat in their seats, the band played, we stacked chairs and moved bleachers. It was time for the choir to come out and sing once more. The thought of how funny it would be to go up on the bleachers and dance came upon us once again. Finally we convinced one of our classmates to do it. She ran to the choir room and put on a choir robe, put her hair in a funny bun fixed on her forehead, and stepped up onto the bleachers.  She took the open spot in the top row. The song began as well as the dance. She broke into random dancing, not in any way matching up with the other dancing choir members. It was obvious she did not belong up there. The crowd soon began to realize what was going on. Laughter broke out in the seats, but soon after laughter broke out behind the stage as well. I was laughing like I had never laughed before. It was painful, tears pouring down my face, I was gasping for air. Running out of breath and bracing myself for a deep inhale, when right at that moment the song had a dead silent pause. The auditorium went completely silent, I inhaled in, and as I took in that air, my body managed to let out an extremely loud embarrassing screeching noise. People behind the curtain stared at me, I knew that it was heard throughout the auditorium. Embarrassed I laughed even harder, causing more pain, tears, and lack of oxygen.  The song ended followed by the end of the laughter, then by the end of the assembly. The girl stepped down from the bleachers and we all scrambled out of the building, hiding the robe along the way. We laughed all the way to our next period, listening to the students in the hallway talking about it. Giggles filled the school for hours. Talk of who it was, what actually happened, and why it happened were on everyone's minds, except for ours. The second period leadership students knew exactly what had happened. We had the pleasure of telling everyone in school about the dirty little details. The following days however, the teachers also got word of it. Not thinking our actions all the way through, we would soon have to face the consequences. We were told it was irresponsible and child-like. We had a plethora of possible punishments, in school suspension, @DATE1 school, a referral, an apology to the choir class, and loss of the privilege of being in leadership. After the school board talked to our parents and gave the event serious consideration, we got out of it with having one day of @DATE1 school and apologizing to the entire choir class. The school board, realized it was just a joke, letting us off easier than it could have been. In my eyes the prank was well worth it. For weeks on end, every night I would go to bed laughing about that leadership assembly."
7," They say laughter is the best medicine @CAPS15 I personally think that's true. For one jokes are a great thing fro laughter but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny @CAPS15 some or @CAPS14 plain horrible. Another reason why laughter is @CAPS5 great is when your laughing that automatically means that your in a good mood @CAPS15 i love to be happy or in a good mood i hate being all mad @CAPS15 upset it @CAPS14 isn't me. I @CAPS14 love it when i cant breathe i am laughing @CAPS5 hard those are the best jokes also you @CAPS11 about wet your self especially if your extremely ticklish @CAPS15 i know quite a few people that are @CAPS15 i feel sorry for them because i would be down right embarrassed if i wet myself in front of anyone. My whole life has had laughter in it to me anytime is laughter time.  Well I have quite a few stories about laughter but i am only gonna tell you one @CAPS15 its one of my favorites its when me @CAPS15 my friends are all hanging out at at mt grandmas house for my @NUM1 birthday party @CAPS15 were all having a great time on the homemade slip @CAPS15 slide the food @CAPS15 the drinks (soda of coarse not alcohol). But anyway my cousin @PERSON1 has these games that he came up with like the @CAPS1 relay , @CAPS2 fishing , @CAPS3 the gum in the whip cream, @CAPS15 my favorite @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is a game where you @CAPS11 have as many players as you want @CAPS15 all the supplies you need are a lot of sting a lot of balloons @CAPS15 one person to start out as the @CAPS4. @CAPS5 say you have @NUM2 humans @CAPS15 one @CAPS4 all the humans would have balloons tied around their waists @CAPS15 they all try @CAPS15 run away from the @CAPS4 @CAPS15 the @CAPS11 hide anywhere inside the boundaries @CAPS15 it doesn't matter how your balloon pops who pops it or what pops it once it is popped @CAPS6 your a @CAPS4 until there are @CAPS12 humans left @CAPS6 you start a new game. Now you might ask yourself why this is funny @CAPS15 now I am gonna tell you why. @CAPS5 were all at my party having a great time right @CAPS5 my cousin @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS5 who wants to play the game @CAPS4? "" @CAPS6 we all say well whats that?"" @CAPS6 he goes over all the rules like a said before @CAPS15 we say ""lets play."" @CAPS5 me @CAPS15 my friend @CAPS9 are running away @CAPS15 all of the sudden we start hearing my cousins @CAPS4 noise that means he coming @CAPS15 he freaked out @CAPS15 ran away @CAPS6 when he leaves you @CAPS14 hear the screeching scream come out @CAPS15 you here his balloon pop that means that he got out @CAPS15 were all @CAPS14 laughing because when he flew he launched about @NUM3 feet backwards it was the funniest thing ever because when i got over there he was still on the ground @CAPS15 everyone @CAPS14 it trying to breathe i swear i think everyone was about to wet them selves @CAPS15 the probably would've laughed some more if it wasn't for the game @CAPS15 @CAPS6 @CAPS9 got up @CAPS15 started chasing people with my cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS15 the rest of us @CAPS14 ran out of there as quickly as possible @CAPS15 yet again you here my cousin making his @CAPS4 noise @CAPS15 people running @CAPS15 screaming @CAPS15 my friend make trying to make the same @CAPS4 noise but cant @CAPS15 one by one i hear the balloons popping @CAPS15 soon i was the last one left @CAPS15 i was gonna give up @CAPS5 i am @CAPS14 getting chased @CAPS15 chased until i am completely out of breath @CAPS15 @CAPS6 one of my friends @ORGANIZATION1 comes up in front of me @CAPS15 i @CAPS14 said ""I don't care @CAPS14 get me out i @CAPS14 wanna lay down."" @CAPS5 he took the balloon @CAPS15 @CAPS14 popped it @CAPS15 i asked ""@CAPS11 i take a nap?"" @CAPS15 he said ""@CAPS12 because we have to get ready for the next round @CAPS5 you better rest up quick or you'll be dogging."" @CAPS5 i @CAPS14 rested up as much as i could before we got everyone straped up for the next game i was hoping to get some kind of reward for winning the very first game of @CAPS4 but @CAPS12 my cousin @PERSON1 had to be a samrt alic about it @CAPS15 say"" @CAPS14 getting to play the game isn't a big enough reward for you stingy!""@CAPS15 as always everyone starts @CAPS14 busting up laughing at every single little thing that my cousin @PERSON1 does but i do have to admit that he is one of the funniest guys that i have ever met. @CAPS5 there you go there is my story about laughter but i do have plenty more but i think ive wasted to much of your time @CAPS5 thats all i have to say."
7," The air was cold and @CAPS1 felt as if @CAPS1 was nipping at my skin. Even though @CAPS2 walked beside me, and I knew that @CAPS2 was colder than I, I couldn't help @CAPS3 imagine burying myself in his warm and comforting black jacket. Walking through the gardens of the park, we kept a space of overflowing tension between us. My entire body was annealed and my heart was practically pounding through my chest in pure agitation. I wanted to look at him, directly at his face and straight into his blue-green eyes. I wanted to try and find something to tip me in on what @CAPS2 was feeling at this very moment; @CAPS3 I didn't dare even sneak a glance. I was afraid that my eyes would reveal all that I dream of and how much I love him. The boy who had moved here over the @DATE1 and came into my life by simply replying to a note I had written in hesitance. The one who's made me cry, smile, laugh and scream in agony. The one who's unknowingly brought me down to my knees in mercy of the emotion known as love; the very thing I had come to realize that I was deathly afraid of. Now there @CAPS2 was, walking beside me in a water drenched wonderland. The sky was gray, with clouds plump with rain that fell lightly. @CAPS1 soaked the ground and made the trees glisten. @CAPS1 was beautiful, @CAPS3 even though @CAPS1 was as such, there was still that hint of sadness. At least @CAPS1 fit the mood that drowned our auras as we walked. I led him farther through the gardens until we reached a vast clearing. Still in a calm hush we walked until we reached a small white gazebo with a view of the river swiftly rushing by only a few feet away. I sat down on a bench that wrapped around a circular post in the middle of @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 quietly sat down near me. The moment was awkward, @CAPS3 after a few minutes we started talking. No later had ten minutes passed, when @CAPS2 began to open most of himself up to me. @CAPS2 told me stories of his life, which weren't the least bit happy in any way, shape or form. Most times they made me want to cry because they broke my heart and tore me to shreds. I know @CAPS1 seems kind of pathetic, @CAPS3 having a rocky past myself, my heart and sense of personality has been twisted and bathed in sensitivity. With that sense of metamorphosis, I've come to be a better person. I care more and worry about the people I love. @CAPS1's honestly just who I am. After a couple hours of this, @CAPS1 soon became silent again. I finally looked over at him only to see him staring down intently at his hands with his back slightly turned to me. His medium-length blond hair covered his face, hiding the view of his expression. His entire body was shaking, and even though the wind was chilly, I knew that @CAPS2 wasn't shaking because of @CAPS1. There was more to @CAPS1 than that, I was sure of @CAPS1. After a few minutes of debating on what I should do, I slowly raised my hand and rested @CAPS1 on his shoulder. His shaking stopped instantly. Time seemed to pass by quickly after that, and the next thing I knew we were both standing and simply hugging each other. ""I'm sorry that things have been so bad for you."" I whispered. ""@CAPS1 isn't your fault."" @CAPS2 replied, hugging me tighter. I nodded slightly, @CAPS3 deep inside I still felt the same. I still wished that I could bring him happiness, and I guess after all this hard work I've been putting myself through, I'm slowly getting there. After we finally released the hug, I looked around and noticed that the air was getting warmer and patches of blue sky and rays of sunlight were beginning to force their way through the clouds. I was smiling at the sight when @CAPS2 brought up the subject of chocolate. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS1's your money!"" I exclaimed, biting my lower lip and looking down at my feet. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS1's my money. So what do you think? Want some chocolate?"" ""@CAPS5... sure, why not?"" I mumbled with a smile at the corners of my lips, and we headed back through the gardens. Things were more relaxed then. We laughed nonstop as we talked about things that weren't so serious, such as how clumsy we are @CAPS3 yet are still able to maintain being 'ninjas'. To this day, we have been together for fifty-six days, and our relationship is strong.  How is @CAPS1 possible? Well, despite our horrific pasts, the element of laughter that sneaks its way through into our moments together is what seems to be the thing that holds us together, even when the world turns its back on us. And to be sincerely honest, I hope @CAPS1 keeps a tight grip on us for years to come."
7," Most of the time we spend our time talking to the same people and judging others because we do not know them. One thinks that there is nothing you and some people can ever come close. Laughter is one of the many puzzle pieces in life that can change things the way you see them. It can even bring two different people that have never considered talking or meeting each other. All though we must never doubt the power of sharing a laugh with someone because it can end up being a break through to a new beginning. We all share the ability to laugh and is a trait that everyone has in common. Why not take that ability to laugh and use it to break the ice with people and start several life long friendships. Instead of making up our own excuses to avoiding the task to try to meet and talk to different people. As the school camping trip approached, I knew I had to think of something that was going to help me get closer to others. This some what long trip was going to require me to get along with students I had never talked to especially certain people. I had to come up with some plan right when one of the teachers was calling out the names of the people in every group. It wasn't very hard for me to start a conversation with people but except people that were on a higher social status then me. Finally it was my group that the teacher was yelling out and so far I knew the name's of the people she was calling. Until she clearly read out the last name from the my group and I started to panic. Most of the people from my group for my cabin were my friends, all but one of them. All the groups happily gathered up, but I was left thinking of what a long trip this was going to turn out to be.  Until now, I had spent a lot of my time thinking that the last girl called in my group was mean. She seemed arrogant and self centered to ever me or her considering talking to each other and definitely not fiends. I had no idea about what I was going to do to make things easier during the camping trip. There couldn't possibly be anything that existed in this world that would bring us close. Talking to her was not a idea I had ever considered because students worshiped her, unlike me. Every girl wanted her in their cabin, but they, like me were missing a quality to bring her close from the long distance. Many attempted to get her closer, but no one had been successful in making her a true fiend. I however was determined to find that something to bring us close even if we didn't end up being best friends. The day of the camping trip, we arrived to the location of the trip, and got our cabins assigned to us. Everybody went to their cabin to take their belonging's they had brought with them and make ourselves comfortable. Surprisingly the cabin was supposed to be for a group of girls to share the tiny space and sleep in. As I unpacked my own things many of the girls began to talk to me about the trip. Would the other girl and I both get the curiosity to talk to each other? She actually did step toward me and began to have a real one word ""conversation"" with me.  When the fun activities finally ended, we were sent off to go to sleep. Sure like a cabin filled with girls was really going to be able to go straight to sleep and sleep all night. Right when the cabin door closed, the noise and giggles began, including mine. The girls that had never talked to me started to to tell a scary story to scare everyone. She got up and said she had to go to the restroom and I had to go with her. We briskly walked to the bathroom without saying a word. I waited for her until she was finish and we started to walk back to the cabin. Until the silence was broken with a eerie sound that was made behind us. Both of us ran, screaming even laughing to the cabin. Confused, asked her why she was laughing and she responded that we were silly for being scared. Amazed that she was talking to me, I agreed with her, laughed a lot and by the end we were close friends. Laughter can force you see the bright side of people instead of the negative. Its an element that you can give or receive from others, but never take away. If you ever have the chance to make someone laugh, go and do it. Not only can it bring endless joy, but it can also impact a time period in your life. Friends wouldn't have been discovered if it weren't for everyone carrying the ability to laugh.   "
7," The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 it's high pitch squeaks, or deep belly bubbly laughter, if it causes the whole room to join unable to stop or is quiet enough for only few to hear, no matter the kind @CAPS20 all over the world laughs. Laughing is a @CAPS2 in which @CAPS20 can understand and I have had the privileged of single-handily witnessing an experience in which this exemplifies perfectly. High school can be an intimidating place to those who come from small middle schools @CAPS22 I did. My freshman year was overwhelming in the least, but a club called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 seemed to help me ""survive"" in a sense. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 consists of a mixture of sophomores, juniors and seniors in high school that work together to help freshman ""@CAPS4"" into high school. They do this by relating their own experiences, running orientations and organizing activities throughout the year. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 members seemed to impact my freshman year @CAPS15 much that I decided to become a member myself. @CAPS16 applying and completing a @DATE1 of training I was assigned to my very first task, an orientation. It included being responsible for a group of students, taking them on a tour of the high school, talking to them about what high school was like and answering any questions they might have.  Now discrimination has always been something I am very strongly against, but I would be lying to you if I said that being assigned to a group of foreign exchange students for my very first orientation was what I had been imagining in my mind while I rehearsed my speeches. I thought I had prepared myself for any situation or circumstance but quite frankly, I didn't even know how to speak @CAPS9. ""@CAPS10-@CAPS10-@CAPS10-hello my name is @CAPS11 and I will be your @CAPS4 @CAPS5 leader for this morning."" I was @CAPS15 absolutely nervous, I couldn't tell but by the looks on their faces but I'd say they couldn't understand a word I was saying. ""@CAPS14 I will be giving you a tour of the high school, going over the recommended classes for you to take, and answering any questions you @MONTH1 have."" All eyes were on me, but not @CAPS15 much in an intently listening way but more of a ""what the heck are you saying"" sort of way. I decided that going on the tour first would be the best thing, since that would probably be something they all could understand. At least that was what I was sincerely hoping.  ""@CAPS15...first would you like to go on the tour of the high school?"" @CAPS16 a long pause a boy spoke up.  ""@CAPS17 tour"" @CAPS18 they all knew what they were doing and all got up and began to walk out the door without me. ""@CAPS19! @CAPS19 for me."" I said, jumping from my stool and sprinting to get ahead of them.  ""@CAPS20 stop please and come right over here!"" I fluctuated my voice trying to hide the irritation and frustration I was feeling.  ""@CAPS21 before we begin lets make sure we all stick together, this school is kind of big and I don't want anybody getting lost."" @CAPS22 I looked around at my group of students, I realized they all looked confused and irritated to be here. My heart began to sink to the bottom of my stomach. I was supposed to be inspiring this group of students, yet I couldn't even help them have a good time, none of them had even smiled.  ""@CAPS21 lets go, this way everybody!"" The @CAPS24 in which my classroom was attached was pretty unexciting, consisting only of a bathroom and an abundance of other classrooms. @CAPS22 I walked and began giving my tour, a few of my boys broke away from the group to use the restroom unannounced. I noticed them, and stopped the group to @CAPS19 for them and continued talking about anything I could think of. I only turned my head for a second when all of a sudden a scream came from the bathroom. My group quickly turned towards the commotion and out ran a girl who I did not recognize. Judging by the look on her face, she was horribly embarrassed and also quite disturbed @CAPS22 she quickly walked away from the restroom. Within seconds of the screams my three boys also exited the restroom. I was about to continue the tour when i realized what had just happened. @CAPS18 @CAPS15 did everybody else, because @CAPS20 instantaneously began to laugh. The agitated girl had screamed because the boys had been in the girls restroom along with her. A mixture of high pitched laughs, silent but sweet giggles, and a random snort from one of my group members is all it took for my group to finally start having a good time. Although we still couldn't understand each other, somehow the joining of laughter made it @CAPS22 if we could. Thanks to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of laughing, to this day members of my past foreign exchange orientation group, walk by me in the halls and spontaneously start to laugh."
7," LIGHTS @CAPS1 The dancing had been going on for hours now, but from the look of things no one knew how late it really was until the last @CAPS2.D. of @NUM1's music had stopped and people were exiting the @NUM1's themed room. The only rule was to dress like you got hit by the @NUM1's @CAPS3(dress from a person in the @NUM1's). The music fit the theme, most songs were of those I never heard before. The decorations were bright colors of red, blue, yellow, green. Balloons covered the floor, there was no way to not move with @CAPS1 stepping on one and popping it. A table in the middle of the floor filled with once full bowls of chips, popcorn, and a party mix, empty soda bottled were falling off the tables. A once dancing group of guys were now huddled in a corner @NUM5, @PERSON4, @CAPS4). @PERSON4 was @PERSON1's boyfriend, @CAPS4 was @PERSON3's The party had died,only another girl was lying on the floor from exhaustion (@PERSON3) that only meant that we would go back to @PERSON1's house to change into more comfortable clothes and hang @CAPS1.  We all arrive at the house. I slip into inside @CAPS1 shorts(didn't notice that it was inside @CAPS1) and the black tank top underneath. When The rest of the girls and I exit @PERSON1's room we find that the boys had disappeared. @PERSON1 knew from her past that they did this to her all the time. We followed her @CAPS1 the door, through a gate, and outside. It was around @NUM6 but the sky looked like it was @NUM7 at night. A mist swirled like clouds in the sky. The moon was the only source of light, the mist would ever so often cover the moon like a blanket, leaving us in the dark. It was warm but still cold from the slight wind that began to pick up. None of us knew the time when we reached the park. In the day time it was bright and lively from the children that ran around, but here now it look like something from a horror movie. There was only one thing in the abandoned parking lot, @PERSON2's truck. The four of us hooked arms in the sight of the park. The path in front of us had dull orange glowing lamps that buzzed in effort not to go @CAPS1. Moths danced around them. The dark shadows seemed to ooze from the parts of the park that had no light. We could see a fully lit baseball field that seemed to sing to us. We all decided to go there and wait for the guys to come to us. We slowly began to make our way. We kept our eyes on the path in front of us, almost like if we were to even glance for a second any where else we would be snatched up by the shadows around us. The light was our protector from the light. Then @CAPS1 of no where @PERSON1 had screamed that almost sounded like a laugh. A guy (who would later be identified as her boyfriend) jump up behind a pole, for a second I thought he was a trash can so when he jumped up I flinched in surprise. He ran off leaving us with @PERSON1 who had some unkind things to say. We pushed on with hope that they would all be together so we can leave this place. When we rounded the winding path to the bridge we saw something white zoom by and disappear into the bushes, @PERSON2 was the only on wearing white so it must be him. We all then began running after @PERSON2 shouting for him stop @PERSON5 and @PERSON3 were still hooked arms and they fell together. We stopped chasing after him when he had disappeared, that's when we realize that we won't on the lilted path no more but in the shadows of the trees. My eyes adjusted to the dark right when I ran into a wall bushes. It seemed that the bushes went on for ever. I couldn't see the top of them. This is why @PERSON2 disappeared so quickly. Suddenly I was ripped away from the bushes. Unknowingly who it was I ran with them. The brightest light i seen all day was slowly making it way around the bushes to greet us in warm presents. When the baseball field came into full view I swear I heard angels singing. @PERSON3 was the first to break for the baseball field the rest of us followed her.  The baseball felt almost warm from the glittering lights that blinded you if you happened to stare at them. I danced in circular motions in the baseball field. I pulled by my pants to the ground. The four of us sat in the middle of the soaking wet field talking. Suddenly @PERSON3's watch beeped. Then @CAPS1 of nowhere the light shut off all at once. The four of us scream in surprise. I could sworn I heard someone laughing behind us as we ran @CAPS1 of there."
7," @PERSON1 was an exchange student from @LOCATION2 that our family had been assigned to host for a week while she stayed in @LOCATION1. I was excited to meet someone from a place I had always dreamed of going, and practice my @CAPS1 with a native @CAPS1 speaker for the first time. When we arrived at the meeting place, the orientation with the coordinator was still in session. As we waited outside, thoughts were running through my head. What does she look like? Will she like our family? The time had come to meet our exchange student for the first time, and all of my thoughts had settled. Within minutes, @PERSON1 was in our family's car, and with us on our way home. When we arrived home, I showed @PERSON1 around the house to make her feel welcomed and comfortable. Not too long afterward, @PERSON1 and I were talking about anything that came to mind. It made me feel like I had a sister for the first time. Sadly, there was a minor language barrier between the two of us but her laughter completed all her thoughts. Her laughter made me feel like she liked me as a host sister and made her stay more fun for her and I. During @PERSON1's stay, I devoted more time to her than to my school work. We played board games and card games each night but they were all at home. I felt like it made her experience boring and incomplete. On @DATE1, the day before her departure, I took her souvenir shopping. It was a jaunt to the mall to shop for her family and experience another part of town. @PERSON1 and I were excited to spend a nice day together and end her trip in an unforgettable way. Our first stop at the mall was @CAPS3-a-@CAPS4 @CAPS5. I had told @PERSON1 about it and she was very excited to @CAPS3 bears for her family. She had never seen anything like it. We started off by picking out a @CAPS4, then we stuffed it, picked out clothes for it, and we gave it a name and made a birth certificate for it. We continued roaming the mall when we finished, but could not find anything too unique or not available in @LOCATION2. Our last stop was @CAPS6 to shop for @CAPS7 snacks. During her stay, I had introduced her to a lot of @CAPS7 foods like granola bars and fruit snack, she liked them and wanted to take them home for brother and little cousins. When we were done, we got on the subway and headed home. My mom was not at the subway station when we got there, so we continued shopping. We walked into an accessories store that was loaded with earrings and necklaces and many other girly items. @PERSON1 and I spotted a section that had friendship necklaces. There was a necklace that said best friends with two roller skates. Roller skating was perhaps the most fun thing she got to experience in @LOCATION1 and it was a great bonding experience for the two of us. Without hesitation, we bought the necklaces and wore it to symbolize our lasting friendship.  That night, after shopping for the whole day, our family took @PERSON1 out for her last dinner in @LOCATION1. Every night, my parents had prepared @CAPS9 food which was relatively close to @CAPS1 food, so when we went out for @CAPS11 food that night, it was the first time @PERSON1 had tried something rather foreign. @PERSON1 told us that the @CAPS11 food in @LOCATION1 tasted different but better than the @CAPS11 food in @LOCATION2. She told us that she really enjoyed the stay and was very grateful for meeting our family. These words made me even more dreadful of @DATE2, the day that she would be fly back to @LOCATION2 and be with her real family. The day we had to say our goodbyes. I had not expected the week to pass by so fast. @DATE2 was here and @PERSON1's stay in @LOCATION1 had came to an end. Cameras were rapidly flashing and my mouth was was hurting from the constant smiling we were doing to capture our last memories. I stayed at the airport for as long as I possibly could and every last moment I spent with her seemed more and more emotional. I had met @PERSON1 just a week ago but I created such a close bond with her that I did not want her to leave. She was like my best friend that knew everything about me and brought me so much joy. I could not help but let out the tears I was trying so hard to hold back. When she entered into security I remember the feeling I had. I didn't know when I was going to see her again, or what our future was going to hold. I had a great time with her and I hope that she felt the same way. Her laughter overrides any communication problems that we had. @PERSON1, your optimistic and friendly personality will always be remembered.  "
7," Everybody that I know loves to laugh. They're mostly my boyfriend, my friends, and my family. All my friends and family come together during the @DATE1 and sit around the camp fire. We all look back on the old days and just laugh at all the things that we did. I loved all the stories my mom told about me when I was a little kid because it makes everybody laugh. Even though some of the stories are embarrassing I don't care; I love a good laugh. Plus that's more memories for my friends to remember for the next time we all come together. We try to all come together once a year because were all slowly but surely growing up. So that means were all busy and have no time, but we all try. Some how I always meet new people at the camp fire. Before my boyfriend was in the picture we were just friends. We liked having each others company. When were together we would be laughing most of the time. Our relationship grew each day we spent together. In our relationship laughing is a big element. @CAPS1 was great at telling me jokes to where I would fall to the ground with pain, because by then he knew what I thought was funny. I knew what made @CAPS1 laugh and what he thought was funny too. When every I'm in town with @CAPS1 we always have plans to go see people; either they invited us or when I'm in town. Our friends had told us that they love our company because they're laughing at us or with us. It's all understandable if they laugh at us because we can be a little goofy at times.The one thing that would make he laugh so hard and I just makes me want to hit him; is when i hurt myself and I'm in pain. Instead of helping me and asking if I'm okay he just laugh. For me I just watch him make a mistake. Once he has done that gets mad, hits the something, and then he gets hurt. That right there makes me laugh because his a hot head. When it's time to go see my friends I'm more close to them then @CAPS1 because we have awesome memories. I have several close friends back home and I still keep in touch with them. My old friends and I get so loud around the camp fire just catching up. When @CAPS1 hears all of us laughing he feels felt out because he has no idea what we're talking about. I know he wants to be part of the group. I mean I would probably feel the same if he was laughing with his friends and I had no idea why. I know that I wouldn't like it and just act immature about the situation. So I would call him to come and join us so my girlfriend can tell him why were laughing so hard. As I step back and look at his face I feel good. Just looking at him smiling and being part of the group makes me feel like I'm floating in clouds.  On the other hand laughing is the biggest element in my family. We all like having a good time especially when were all camping. The kind of laughing in my family is laughing at each other. It's kinda wrong, but that's how we are and it's fine with us to a point. If were all camping and there's not a single person talking. My grandma would walk in the middle of the camp fire; look at us and just fart real loud and walk away like nothing had happen. Of course I burst out laughing my lungs out. By me laughing it broke the ice and everyone became chatty. In my moms house you either hear us girls laughing or yelling at each other. My sisters and I have a very special bond. With all my sisters we all have inside jokes with one another. Its great at time because then if there is a disagreement you have someone on your side because of the inside joke. I think that laughter is a big element to any relationship. With your friends you make memories and when you get together you talk about old times. I guarantee you that someone will be laughing. It's a great feeling to laugh with a person. It makes you feel close to that person. With my boyfriend laughter is important to me. Less laughing means to me that there is lots of stress and your not that happy. So without that i would feel incomplete. Laughter is a sense of joy and happiness. It makes everything go easy. When your feeling down and crying; one of your lovely family members will come in and try to make you laugh. Besides laughter is part of the world; have you ever been somewhere where there is people and not hear anyone laughing? I don't think so. It's a everyday thing and its really good for the health."
7," Laughter, @CAPS1 is it? Say someone makes a joke that is supposed to be a funny joke, but no one laughs after the joke has been told. If it is considered a ""funny joke"" then why did nobody laugh? To me laughter is something that I do when I find something funny or worth laughing at.  There are many different kinds of laughter. There's a chuckle kind of laugh where something is kind of funny but not funny enough to laugh hysterically at such as something funny on television. Then there is a laugh out loud kind of laugh where your making sound when you laugh but its not to the point where your laughing so hard that you have to gasp for air. Lastly there is a hysterical laugh. The hysterical laugh is where you laugh so hard where your abs start hurting because your laughing so hard. The hysterical laugh is the laugh where you gasp for air because you are laughing so hard that you have no time to breathe. Whatever it was it must have been really funny if you have forgotten to breathe.   Although there are many kinds of laughter there are many kinds of jokes such as, knock knock jokes, blond jokes, racist jokes, redneck jokes, yo mama jokes and many more. @CAPS1 type of world would this be without comedy? Without laughter your day to day activities would be no fun. Laughing gives you this feeling that you can't get without laughter. I think when you laugh it sends a chemical to your brain to let your brain know something funny happened so it can store that memory. You know how you forget stuff sometimes? Do you think if the events would've been funny you would've been able to remember them? Without laughter do you think everyone would be depressed? The times I laugh are the times I never forget because those are the best memories and the ones I want to remember the most.  I have this friend who I swear could be a comedian. He is the funniest guy I know. He can make me laugh without even trying, he just has that humorous personality that everyone loves because he's good at being the center of attention. Being funny just comes natural to him. The reason we have friends is so they can be there for you, but if they can't make you laugh wouldn't you consider them boring? When I make new friends usually the people that interest me most are the ones that aren't boring and who can make me laugh who I consider to be funny. Laughter is two different things, it is an action, and it is also a feeling. You can make yourself laugh at any time you want. Although when you laugh just to laugh you don't feel the same as you would when your laughing at something that really is funny. Laughter isn't necessarily a ""feeling"" but when you laugh it gives you a feeling of happiness. I can't think of a time when I have laughed for absolutely no reason unless someone told a joke that I didn't find funny but I figured I should laugh anyways and pretend it was funny to make them feel better about themselves.  In a relationship laughter is important. Can you imagine being in a relationship whether its with the opposite sex or if its just a friend kind of relationship and not laughing with one another? @CAPS1 would be the point? Yeah, you'll have someone there for you but when your crying or just down in general they wouldn't have a way to help you or cheer you up without trying to make you laugh. In a relationship where there is no laughter, would just be a boring relationship. Laughter is a hard thing to explain, without it everything would seem so boring. Since your used to laughing on a daily basis you don't notice how much you laugh because laughing is just a natural reaction. You don't control when you do or don't laugh. You can try not to laugh, but it doesn't always work. Have you ever noticed when something is really funny and you try not to laugh that after a couple seconds of trying not to laugh it just kind of blurts out all on its own.  Laughter usually comes from something funny. @CAPS1 exactly is the word ""funny?"" @CAPS1 does it even mean? I don't know the exact definition but I can almost guarantee if I looked it up in the dictionary that laughter would be under the word funny. We all know that laughter is a fun thing to do, because we all like laughing. I think that you could ask as many people as you want and they would all say they like laughing because its something we all do naturally. We don't know @CAPS1 its like to not laugh. In the end laughing is an important part of anything and everything we do. It makes the boring stuff fun, and it keeps the fun stuff from being boring."
7,"Dad's @CAPS1 In the not so distant past I needed to buy my father a birthday gift. The usual cologne and tie were too frequently his gift, so I decided to go into the uncharted waters of @CAPS2 and get him an amazing gift. I walked into the store, with red and white isles, with @PERSON2 my older sister and @PERSON1 my younger brother. We all had the same goal, but different results, to get our father a gift @CAPS3 would love. The search then began. After much time considering @CAPS5 to get my father @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 bought him new socks and I bought him a @CAPS1 that held batteries and could even vibrate, for a closer shave. Little did I know that @CAPS1 would change the lives of my brother and I, and this is where the adventure truly begins. Several days after I had given my father the @CAPS1 as his birthday present, I saw it next to the sink glinting in the light. @PERSON1 and I were brushing our teeth as usual after our lunch. I know your recommended to brush after meals by the dentist, but no one ever really does. I wanted to be a pediatric dentist when I grew up so I made sure my brother and I brushed our teeth. @PERSON1 was spitting blobs of white foam into the sink and I made it a course of action to make mine bigger than his. This was a competition I had seen on a movie many years before and it made my eight year old brother brush more thoroughly. I was almost ready to rinse when the @CAPS1 caught my eye. My brother had begun to rinse his green toothbrush. I played with the button that turned the vibrate on and off. I demonstrated the function to @PERSON1. My gift was definitely better than his, but @PERSON1 seemed to disagree.  Then out of a pure joking tone I whispered, ""I dare you to shave your eyebrow off.""  @CAPS3 smiled and showed his infamous dimples, the same dimples @CAPS3 had shown when @CAPS3 first learned to tie his shoes and ride his bike without training wheels. I loved my brother and I didn't think @CAPS3 would ever attempt such an impulsive stunt. @CAPS3 grabbed the @CAPS1 and turned the vibrate button on, then just as it was above his eyebrow @CAPS3 quickly turned the vibration off and slid the @CAPS1 down his eyebrow. His eyebrow had disappeared in the blink of an eye, and my jaw dropped to the recently re-tiled floor. My brother stared at the mirror in shock, his deep brown eyes almost out of their sockets.  Was my brother a fool? @CAPS5 had @CAPS3 just done? The answers came just as soon as the questions had. My brother didn't know that the @CAPS1 would shave when its vibrate button was off. @CAPS3 had thought it only shaved when the vibrate was on. I began to smile uncontrollably and laughter started to roll out of my mouth and into the air. @PERSON1 had shaved half an eyebrow off! @CAPS3 stared at me with anger marked by the wrinkles on his forehead.  ""@CAPS4't tell mom,"" was all @CAPS3 could say. @PERSON1 knew that as soon as our mom knew @CAPS3 would be lectured for sure. @CAPS3 went the day without eye contact from others, for fear they would notice the missing eyebrow. To me this was hilarious and a story I would preserve in my memory for my future family. All the work my brother was doing to hide this secret wouldn't last for long. Someone would have to notice, and it was the last person @CAPS3 desired to have know. My mother came home and began to cook dinner. We set the table and I couldn't stop staring at @PERSON1's nonexistent eyebrow, I began to giggle and @CAPS3 started too also! Then it turned into a roaring laughter. My mothers attention immediately was directed toward us. I couldn't talk. As soon as I sucked in enough air she asked @CAPS5 was going on that she didn't know. I told her the truth, and @PERSON1 looked down at his palms. I ran out of the kitchen holding onto my stomach, and into the living room where I could hear my mother. ""@CAPS5 were you thinking! You know better than to take a dare..."" I could hear the words floating away from the kitchen and into my ears. The lecture went on for several minutes until my mom noticed the steaming red rice on the stove top. I came back in when I thought things had cleared. We sat and ate our dinner in silence, and didn't mention my brothers nonexistent eyebrow.  To this day this profound story makes my brother and I laugh. We can look back on it and appreciate the cleverness of how everything it seems was almost planned out. @PERSON1 has avoided razors near him in the bathroom and now brushes his teeth alone as to resist temptation that could cause humiliation. For me, this day will never be forgotten."
7,"Laughter is a tool that every one knows how to use. It can be used when having a good time with friends or meeting someone new. When I am around people I don't know I feel uncomfortable so I wont start a conversation. I listen to others talk to people that I do know and then ad my own opinion to their conversation. You could call it eavesdropping but I think of it as studying some ones personality before trying to get to know them. If you here some one tell a joke or laugh at one that gives you an idea of what their sense of humor is like. I get to know someone by trying to make them laugh and observing there reaction for example when I met my friend @PERSON1's dad @PERSON8. I met him when my friend @PERSON5 invited me to go camping with his family. @PERSON5 is @PERSON1's little brother but they have different dads @PERSON5 and his twin sister @PERSON2 are the same age as me and the youngest is @PERSON4 but like every little sibling the rest find her annoying. The last five people in are group were @PERSON1's twins @CAPS1 and @PERSON3, @PERSON5's girlfriend, @PERSON1's boyfriend, and @PERSON2's boyfriend @PERSON7 but every one calls him @CAPS2. Their mother @PERSON6 drove us to the camp grounds and then left that confused me because I didn't know that @PERSON8 was meeting us there or even who he was. When @PERSON8 arrived we had already setup our tents and started a fire as i helped to unpack @PERSON8's car @PERSON1 introduced me to her dad and everyone continued unpacking as @PERSON8 told us what he brought and and where we should put it. After everything was unpacked we had to decide who was sleeping in which tent @PERSON8 brought his own tent, my brother lent me his, and @PERSON1 brought one too. I wanted to sleep in the tent i brought but @PERSON1 had planed on having a tent for her and her boyfriend on one side of the tent and the boys @CAPS1 and @PERSON3 on the other. The other tent had two teenage couples in it and i hate feeling like a third wheel. My only options were to sleep with @PERSON4 and the boys on one side of the tent or sleep in @LOCATION1's tent. When @PERSON1 told this to me and @PERSON8 in an attempt to be funny he said ""I don't bite but I do swing in my sleep so if you wake up with a black eye my bad"" they both laughed and i let out an uncomfortable chuckle then began moving my gear to @PERSON8's tent. The day when on as we all ate and talked around the table at our camp I stared singing a @CAPS4 song to my self and @PERSON8 recognized it. He told me that's a good song I asked if he spoke @CAPS4 he said yes then told me how he learned how and a story of someone who was talking trash in @CAPS4 and thought he couldn't understand. I then told him that i think its funny to speak @CAPS4 with my friends around people that cant understand he said that a lot of people find that offensive and disrespectful. When it got dark one by one everyone went to bed my sleeping bag was around the center of the tent because it was set up on a hill. The next day i woke up in the lowest corner of the tent when i got out to see who else was awake it was just me and the adults we laughed as @PERSON8 said how I slid to the side of the tent and then down to the corner. After breakfast We spent the after noon at the beach. When we got back @PERSON8, @PERSON2, @CAPS2, and I went to the sand dunes next to camp. We decided that we wanted to go for a hike to see if we could reach the beach. I thought we would be walking in sand the hole time so i left my shoes at camp. we didn't see the beach only bigger sand dunes that looked like they lasted forever. It was getting dark and @PERSON8 wanted to get us all back to camp why there was still sun light. So we went strait through the brush instead of around again. I walked bare foot through thorns, sticks, rocks, bushes, and I had to jump off a tree that was in are way. when I got back to I was tired my feat were hurting and bleeding but I was happy @PERSON8 couldn't stop talking about how proud he was of me. He told everyone that i never complained or slowed down he was joking that i should have bin his son and that my feet were made of rock my feet were in pain but all i could do was laugh. I made a new friend that day and to me laughter was what sealed are friendship. today i still look back and laugh."
7,"                             When Laughter @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 mom has always told me that laughter is the best medicine. In life sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh, just laugh away all your troubles. @CAPS3 parents brought me up using this method. Even at the lowest point of someones life when they are in the darkest place, it always helps to laugh. Once, I thought @CAPS3 life was over, but laughter saved the @CAPS2. A few years ago when I was thirteen it became obvious that @CAPS3 parents were having marital issues. Apparently they'd had these issues for years, but I was too naive to notice. The tension between @CAPS3 parents spread and developed to tension among the kids. @CAPS3 three siblings and I were always ready for a fight and no one was communicating well with anyone else. Mom and dad didn't fight as much as they ignored each other and talked behind each others backs. @CAPS3 role somehow became the messenger. Whether they intended me to be or not, I was who kept the two of them speaking. They spoke through me. I was very confused and wanted them both to feel like they could trust me. Though I couldn't help but share the private things I knew with each of them. This created massive drama, but I couldn't fix it. It was just a matter of time before the drama escalated to family counseling, a break, divorce, etc. Thinking about these things is one thing, experiencing them is a whole other ball game. One @CAPS2 after school I went home with a friend to do homework. Being outside of the house helped me realize that @CAPS3 family's problems were not as bad as they seemed. I still had a good life with many wonderful people in it. Later that @CAPS2 I got a random call from @CAPS3 mom saying that she needed to pick me up right away. It was weird, but I didn't mind. As we were driving home I could tell that something was wrong. Then she told me. She told me everything. Right there in the car, she told me @CAPS4 happened. @CAPS3 dad was gone. She kicked him out, and @CAPS3 dad was gone. Gone? These feelings were so foreign to me. I wanted to know where he was, but she was unaware herself. @CAPS3 tears were uncontrollable and flowing at a steady beat. When I walked in the door to a couch full of sobbing kids, the tears came harder and @CAPS3 pain increased. This was all too much, and I got out of there quick. I remember just running down the street not knowing @CAPS4 else to do. It was almost like I was running away from the news and running in search of @CAPS3 dad at the same time. I wanted him. I needed him back and it wasn't okay that he left. He should have known it was not alright to leave us. I lost @CAPS3 dad, @CAPS3 best friend, and @CAPS3 less than perfect world fell apart. After that @CAPS2 things were not the same. The vibe around the house was very uneasy and @CAPS6 was sad. Even mom. Days passed and the awkwardness of not knowing how to deal with our situation was unbearable. I wanted to do something, just anything to break the silence and make a statement. @CAPS3 dad had his own little room, it was like a den or a study. He had all his treasures in there, an abundance of books, and everything that reminded me of him. I went in there with a bunch of boxes and I started to pack his belongings. I was packing up @CAPS3 dad. The process was almost complete. The only thing left was a portrait of him from his childhood mounted up on the wall. Just as I was taking it down, @CAPS3 younger brother and sister walked in on me. I will never be able to forget their faces. So crushed and shocked, they were devastated and furious. All at once I heard, ""@CAPS4 are you doing?!"" ""I hate you!"" ""@CAPS5 everything back!"" @CAPS6 was emotional at this point. I didn't have a plausible explanation, I just did it to do it. I came back with worse things to say at a higher volume. All three of us were going at it with full vocal force. @CAPS3 mom and older sister rushed in to see @CAPS4 all the commotion was about in @CAPS4 seemed like seconds later. At that moment the three of us @CAPS7 kids busted up with laughter. We were using each other to unleash all of our bottled emotions that we had been struggling to deal with since @CAPS3 dad left. I'm sure @CAPS3 mom and sister were very confused, we were unable to stop laughing. The things we had said, all the crying, our red faces, it was all very amusing. We learned that it was necessary to take a break from the sadness and be happy. Now we know that @CAPS7 is never the answer. And that laughter always is."
7,"     The @CAPS1 Laughter Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS2 statement is very true. Laughter sometimes seems to be the only connection you have with another person. It also creates a safe spot to turn to when stuck in awkward situations. From @CAPS9 experiences, I have learned that laughter is key to relationships and has helped me make many friends. I am a very shy person and find it difficult talking to people I @CAPS5't know.  @CAPS9 friend @PERSON2 and I have been best friends since third grade but when we got to high school, we both ventured out and made new friends. It had been a while since we had hung out and I missed her greatly.  One day at school she asked me, ""@CAPS3 @PERSON3, wanna volunteer with me at @CAPS4.I.S.H. today?"" I immediately accepted the invitation, looking forward to some catching up.  After school that @DATE1, her mom, @PERSON1, picked us up and drove us to the food bank. While in the car, @PERSON2 told me that she had invited some of her other friends too. Guy friends. Results of the venturing. I'm not too good in the area of guys, so I was pretty nervous. Just when I thought it impossible, the situation turned from serious to critical as I found out one of the boys was @CAPS9 crush. That @CAPS5.   ""@CAPS6!"" I thought to myself, for I hadn't told @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 juicy little detail. The car pulled into @CAPS4.I.S.H. parking lot. I unfastened @CAPS9 seat belt and exited the car, knees shaking, sweat forming. @CAPS2 would surely be the most awkward day of @CAPS9 life. I hoped and prayed the boys wouldn't be there when @PERSON2 and I stepped through those doors. Luckily, @CAPS9 wish had come true. The only person greeting us was a little old lady, there to instruct and supervise.  An hour passed with still @CAPS12 sign of those apelike creatures we know as boys. I was so relieved but dreaded any second they might come waltzing through the main door, disrupting @CAPS9 now perfected bagging process. Another hour passed as @PERSON2 and I began to cleanup, still @CAPS12 sign of men. When the whole room was spotless, every can in its place, @PERSON2 and I signed out. The supervisor, who had greatly impressed me that day by lugging what was surely more than her weight of cans to and from vehicles, thanked us for our time as we signed out and left.  I was overjoyed, absolutely filled to the brim with relief as I got back into the car to be taken home. @PERSON2's mom had gotten us donuts as a reward for our noble services. A delicious maple bar was a @CAPS6 end to an awesome day. I thanked @PERSON1 and went inside, sticky pastry in hand and backpack on back. I was too enthralled with @CAPS9 maple bar to even notice @CAPS9 free hand that shouldn't have been so free. Entering @CAPS9 room, greeted by the scent of vanilla candles, is when I realized something was missing. ""@CAPS8 snap!"" I grunted, ""@CAPS9 biology book!"" @CAPS2 normally wouldn't have been an issue, but @CAPS9 biology teacher had decided to be the coolest cat in town and assign the class a project over the weekend. ""@CAPS8 for the love!"" I got out @CAPS9 phone, called up @LOCATION1, and explained @CAPS9 situation. ""@CAPS12 biggie. Come by whenever and pick it up,"" I was told. @CAPS9 mom started up the car and loaded the kids in as we sped to @LOCATION1's place. When I arrived, there was @CAPS12 answer at the door, so I walked on in. ""@PERSON2!"" I yelled a little too much like an opera singer. She came bouncing around the corner with her new friend @CAPS13 trailing behind. Before I realized what was happening, @CAPS5 came around the opposite corner, all three of them making an @PERSON3 sandwich. @CAPS13 hit me with a pillow, @PERSON2 stepped back laughing, and @CAPS5 took off with @CAPS9 book. I chased after him, giggling, and lunged. @CAPS5 stopped and turned around, @CAPS9 biology book hidden behind his back, and proceeded to make a deal. ""I'll give your book back, if you give me a hug."" I froze a little but urged @CAPS9 brain to turn back on and give that boy a hug. Before I knew what I was doing, @CAPS9 arms wrapped around him and squeezed. He smiled down at me and gave me back @CAPS9 book. @PERSON2 and @CAPS13 entered the room after that. They asked me to stay and hang out. I was so giddy and jellylike, but I accepted. That night was the first time I had ever hung out with @CAPS5. There were plenty of awkward moments between us, but it was nothing we couldn't fix with a quick joke or bit of laughter. The laughter was key to our friendship. It gave us stories and inside jokes to talk about later. It was a way of relating to someone new. Thanks to laughter, I got over me fears and made some amazing friends."
7," ""@CAPS1 figure something out to do! I am really freaking bored!"" @CAPS2 explained as all of us relaxed next too his dark blue @CAPS3 which was gracefully parked right out side of my house. The @ORGANIZATION1 was young and as young boys we needed something to do. Gears started to turn in my head! As i thought of a bullet proof plan that would be very funny.  ""@CAPS4 I've got it!"" I yelped. ""@CAPS1 here it, I'm really down for anything right @CAPS21,"" @CAPS6 quickly replied. ""@CAPS7 since @CAPS2 has car he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran rap then @CAPS15 back to the four way intersection right out side of my neighborhood and tie the rap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so cars will speed through it!"" I quick explained as i ran out of breath. Bursts of loud laughter came from all directions were my friends were standing as I came to realization that this idea was golden. ""I will drive and go get it, but does anyone got some money too pitch in!"" @CAPS2 pounced as @LOCATION2, @CAPS6 and I, handed single bills to him.  "" that's plenty! give me a few minutes then we can meet at the intersection right out side of @CAPS10's neighborhood."" @CAPS2 said as he brushed everyone off his car and begin to dip out of my neighborhood. ""@CAPS12 text me when you're about to get back!"" I screamed to @CAPS2 as sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the @TIME1 sky. Minutes flew by and the rest of us just sat down on the curb, talked, and waited for @CAPS2. Ring ting my custom ring tone for incoming texts sounded. My eyes quickly scanned the phone's contents and concluded that @CAPS2 was ready with the saran rap at the four way intersection.  ""@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready and so @CAPS1 do this thing"" I muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 trailed, as @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the back. i yelled once again to enhance the passe. @CAPS2's car lights lit up the @ORGANIZATION1 air as he made a blinking signal to express where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where @CAPS2 was parked. ""@CAPS17 you @CAPS4 long enough,"" @CAPS2 explained. ""well we are all here! so @CAPS1 go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON1 explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all @CAPS17 to this opportunity and @NUM1 and @PERSON1 look out for cars!"" i yelled as @CAPS2 and i began the process. Quickly i opened the saran rap and ran crossed the road, uncoiling the rap as i went. Soon as @CAPS2 and I were both on opposite sides of the street we both started to firmly rap the saran around trees we have already pick out. Once i pulled and inspected it finding that it was prefect i sprinted to a short fence that was a boarder for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. ""haha this is prefect! i am made sure everything feels right!"" I explained as we all gazed upon delicately hung rap than ran from both sides of the two way street. ""@CAPS21 we must wait,"" @PERSON2 said as anticipation fell into place. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM2 pm most of the good folk of @LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @CAPS21 were, speeding and only @NUM3 yards from the great prank. ""@CAPS22,"" i yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car speed through the saran rap, then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the anger male driver hearing our laughing decided too leave his car and chase us! ""@CAPS23 up,"" I screamed! We all @CAPS23 right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS6! The anger man caught him as the rest of us all high tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house we all began too ask our self's what happened too @CAPS6! Suddenly out of @CAPS21 where @CAPS6 came running, as he @CAPS22 reached us we started too burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda! @CAPS6 would never tell us what happened that @ORGANIZATION1 although we could have guessed! As the @CAPS25 and long @ORGANIZATION1 rapped up we all called quits and hit the sack at my house. But laughter wasn't in short supply that @ORGANIZATION1 as we all fell asleep!"
7," I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS6 someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS2 the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened in @LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS4 was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS6 we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't @CAPS4"" he told me laughing. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS4 to hurt anyone.""  I thought @CAPS4 was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS6 I started to laugh again. ""@CAPS2 did I say now?"" he asked. ""@CAPS3. I was just remembering @CAPS2 you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS4 was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live know because @CAPS4's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS2 I had told him because he knows @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS4 got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS4 was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""@CAPS6 did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations."
7," I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along."
7," @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever."
7,"                             Living, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter     @CAPS4 to this @DATE1 I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfathers face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that @DATE1, so many years ago, he shined his happiness @CAPS1 love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My @CAPS16, who we all called @CAPS5, had a way of keeping the peace @CAPS1 happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry @CAPS3 @CAPS5, @CAPS1 no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. @CAPS5 was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, soon after, he passed away. When I look back @CAPS1 realize how important that @DATE1 was I can see that it was a perfect @CAPS8 for everyone. It was a happy @DATE1 @CAPS1 my @DATE1 memories of my @CAPS16 were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.     When that @CAPS8 kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits @CAPS1 was ready to enjoy the @DATE1 @CAPS3 family. My favorite activity during each @CAPS1 every family event is to play my favorite games @CAPS3 everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called @CAPS12-@CAPS13. Now @CAPS12-@CAPS13 was one of the many games that my @CAPS16 was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, @CAPS1 would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced @CAPS5 @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 to play @CAPS12-@CAPS13 @CAPS3 me. We went into the spare room @CAPS1 starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, @CAPS1 to no ones surprise, @CAPS5 was winning. It was just before the food was ready @CAPS1 we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin @PERSON1, or @CAPS5 said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny @NUM1 year old ears had ever heard, @CAPS1 I began to laugh.     My family was so thoroughly entertained @CAPS3 my laughter that they could not keep their smiles @CAPS1 laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS16. @CAPS5' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @CAPS1 vivid in front of me,that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. @CAPS5' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.    No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the @DATE1 I would spend @CAPS3 my @CAPS16. Everything was so perfect @CAPS1 so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, @CAPS1 if I had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8, that @DATE1 would be perfect. My single memory of that @DATE1 was laughing, @CAPS1 being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my @DATE1 bit a time @CAPS3 @CAPS5 then a @DATE1 where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, @CAPS1 smiles.    Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, @CAPS1 can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt @CAPS1 never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, ""@CAPS25. Laugh. Love."" I believe those three words can combine together, @CAPS1 act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to @CAPS25 out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, @CAPS1 love. Love brings us all together, @CAPS1 when we strive to be happy @CAPS1 to love, that is when we can truly @CAPS25. My grandfather loved each @CAPS1 every one of his family @CAPS1 friends @CAPS1 made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever @CAPS25 it. He died after a life full of love happiness @CAPS1, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter.        "
7,"Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, ""@CAPS1 me?"" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said ""@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!"" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, ""@CAPS7's @CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""@CAPS7?"" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say."" I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" @CAPS2 then I asked her another. ""@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" @CAPS27 mom said. ""@CAPS7? Ear-hair?"" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""@CAPS29"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS30"" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said ""@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  ""@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. ""@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. ""@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS46 away."" @CAPS4 said with a smile. ""@CAPS48."" I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49."
7,"       Laughter In A Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the duties we do all day because we get frustrated a lot of times. So one thing that helps us is laughter. If someone is upset the person might watched a comedy movie or read a comic about funny or humorous characters. But many people like talking to someone when they are upset and need a uplift from them. When I was once upset regarding my school work and about not having a job. I went out for a walk after an argument with my work mother. About my grades being dropped. My mom got quite angry and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew I was much more capable than I showed in my grades. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy things what I wanted. They didn't think it appropriate to linger around about having a job so much and not care about my grades.When I was walking along the lake side I heard someone playing a guitar and he played it so beautifully that I wanted to meet that person instantly. I tried to find him but I couldn't and at last I just set down and wondered who that person might be. So suddenly a boy came to me with a guitar and asked me what time is it. I told him the time and asked him where he learn t to play guitar such beautifully. So he told me that he is interested in playing guitar for a long time and he wants to join a band.We both shared our feeling and we couldn't even understand that the things we never told anyone else we were telling each other  @CAPS1 after that meeting we came close friends and we met everyday. He knew I was quite tensed so he used to play guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes and I knew he was doing all this just for me and I sometimes just kept quite and didn't respond to his jokes. He got more tensed that I was not laughing or smiling. But I didn't realize that by doing this I was really making him hurt.But he never lost hope in me and he kept on telling me funny stories and we talked over the phone whole night just so that he could make my tensions a bit less and make me laugh. So one day he took me out for lunch at @ORGANIZATION1's because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going their. He took me to a comedy movie on superheroes but neither of them were making me laugh. All the time I was just in his arms. But after the movies he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach and the whole place was decorated by colorful lights and we were sitting down on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy and he told me jokes and we read comic books and surprisingly I started loving his jokes and the comics we read. Whenever I would meet him he would do something special for me and made me laugh. He once got dressed down as clown and tried to juggle balls but he couldn't do it so well and i laughed at him so badly. I know it was being rude to laugh at him but I loved spending time with him.  One day he came to my home and we were talking and he held my hands and proposed me. I was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He proposed me and took me out for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectfully manner, not in a intention that he is putting me down. But I had never seen a person like him and he he told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. N o matter what happens tomorrow why should we care about it today when we have such a beautiful life waiting for us. We must live the way we want and not force our selves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took me his arms and said @CAPS2 matter how much we love each other but laughter is important in a relationship I looked at him and asked him why'd? So he replied we'd must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other. After we had some time there he dropped me home and told me live life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment I realized that he was right and I looked at life from a different perspective from that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laugh and enjoy."
7,"I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and,how they feel about you,@CAPS1 that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. @CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person.Laughter is from the heart and soul. @CAPS1 that person Tell's you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings,@CAPS2, @CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @CAPS3 is from the soul and down deep with in your body. as my mom would say @CAPS3 helps clear the mind and body , but what i really think is that @CAPS1 some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS1 it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS3 is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS4 it is funny then you start @CAPS3 about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that ""@CAPS4 you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS3 is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS3 because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS4 I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS1 you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but im a teenager what do you think i will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally under stand the joke. I know I am a @CAPS5 but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are @CAPS5 and I also have @CAPS5 jokes about me and I really do not mind @CAPS1 people tell @CAPS5 jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS1 I heard my first @CAPS5 joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like ""@CAPS6 I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. @CAPS1 you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves, or someone that is related to them. @CAPS1 you laugh is like your showing your feelings and, @CAPS2 to that person, because @CAPS4 you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they where trying to tell you. I will always tell my self @CAPS4 i need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning. because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking. most people think that @CAPS4 you look at your self and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non stop. the reason i laugh is because i see or hear something really funny o just wanna laugh so much. @CAPS4 i have a good day or a good weekend i laugh a lot"
7,"   I was late like usual for the bus; barley having any time to sit before it moved. I saw my friends sitting in seats directly behind one in other @CAPS2 I stopped and said to them,      ""@CAPS1 guys make it @CAPS2 hard to choose."" I smiled sarcastically.   @PERSON1 who was sitting behind @CAPS3 motioned for me to sit with her. I gave @PERSON1 a quick smile and told her that @CAPS3 and I would turn around and talk with her. @PERSON1 smiled as @CAPS21 leaned her head against my seat. @CAPS3 and I gave @PERSON1 about five minutes of quiet, then we started talking with her. About the time we arrived at the middle school, we all were having a swell time. Until then @CAPS3 and I were fine! But as soon as the bus left the middle school, we were in an uproar of laughter! Everything @CAPS21 said made me laugh and everything I said made her laugh too! After we left the middle school though, this little sixth grader came to sit in front of us and boy was he annoying! He kept turning around, giving @CAPS3 and I weird stares and asking us how many joints we had smoked. Of course that made @CAPS3 and I crack up even more! I was blabbing about how I had stuff in my biology book. But I was talking about notes! The boy obviously thought I was talking about joints. Well for one, I will not smoke, try it, or let it ever come near me. @CAPS2 I thought it was absolutely hilarious that he thought I meant joints. @CAPS3 who was sitting to the left of me, had her head on the seat crying because @CAPS21 was laughing @CAPS2 hard. Seeing this, I laughed even harder @CAPS2 that the sounds coming out of both of us, were the silent and deadly laughter. The boy still turned around with stares and added eyebrows. As soon as we passed the fruit packing company, he started taking in @CAPS8 to us. Now I'm trying to learn @CAPS8, @CAPS2 I didn't have the faintest idea of what he was saying to us. Neither did @CAPS3. Of course he didn't know what he was talking about either. He was leaning over in the isle to talk to these native @CAPS8 speakers who were also watching us with huge smiles on their faces. Being the comedian that I am, I decided to start talking about how he could know more @CAPS8, then me when he was only in sixth grade!He of course quieted right down, but the @CAPS8 speakers were howling with laughter. I mean I was shedding tears the time @CAPS3 got off the bus. After @CAPS21 got off, I decided to check in on ol' @PERSON1. @CAPS21 looked like @CAPS21 was trying to sleep, @CAPS2 I gently nudged her and @CAPS21 looked up at me. I had personally forgotten about @PERSON1 in the back until @CAPS3 got off at her stop.      ""@CAPS16 @CAPS1 @CAPS17.k? Do @CAPS1 need a doctor?"" @PERSON1 asked with a confused grin on her face.I tried to talk, but was laughing in between all of my words,@CAPS2 it came out as pea soup!  ""@CAPS17.k, now @CAPS1 really scare me!"" @PERSON1 retorted with a serious face. ""@CAPS18 come on @PERSON1! I'm suppose to scare @CAPS1! The freshman scare sophomores, sophomores - juniors,and juniors scare the seniors?"" I explained, laughing in between it all. Still my @CAPS19 sounded like pea soup.  ""@CAPS20, but @CAPS1 still scare my personally. Don't do that!"" @CAPS21 belted out laughing. I had put my face over the seat, then lowered my head @CAPS2 that all @CAPS21 could see were my eyes. I then did my @CAPS22 @CAPS23 eyebrow thing in which I move my eyebrows from one side of my forehead to the other, in a wave motion. I thought that I was making her laugh! Which I was, but the outburst made even more people look at us. I mean the attention was fine. But the boy still would interrupt @PERSON1 and I. He was just blurt out,"" @CAPS24 bueno? @CAPS24 bueno?""  @PERSON1 and I again would just look at him. He of course was soaking all the attention in. He then I think, insulted my mother, which @PERSON1 pointed out.But I didn't care at that point because I was in such a happy mood, that I wasn't going to let someone who I didn't even know, ruin it. Both @PERSON1 and I looked up to see her stop coming up. It was really something to think back to all we have done together on the bus. The famous disappearing bus driver ride was a hilarious day and @CAPS2 was the proof reading my @CAPS19 paper bus ride. Good times. I told her this as @CAPS21 was getting off the bus. @CAPS21 laughed and @CAPS2 did I.     Finally, when the bus reached my stop, I crossed over the road and headed home. For fun I decided to look back at the bus. I did and saw the boy starring at me. I lost it then."
7," In life @CAPS13 share many of your moments laughing and enjoying the sweet and gentle sound of the chorus that @CAPS13 and the people in your life share. Laughter can bring @CAPS13 instantly to enjoyment no matter how unbearable the struggles in your life @MONTH1 be.  I've had many moments in my life that became enjoyable because of laughing and smiling. But one moment sticks out above the others. This moment is the @CAPS1 before my grandpa passed away. This @CAPS1 was the best of all. It was a white @CAPS1, and for once the snow wasn't the only thing that was gleaming. On this day, everyone in my family was smiling, we were all thankful that my grandpa survived his sudden heart-attack that happened the week before and we all knew that his time was near. We had to make his last @CAPS1 a great one to end on.  My grandpa was the sweetest old man, he could always make @CAPS13 smile no matter how sad @CAPS13 were. He was a man, who enjoyed the laughter of his grandchildren and he made sure that he made an impact in our lives. This @CAPS1 though was one where our laughter made the largest impact.  On @DATE1, everyone on my dad's side of the family drove over the hills to their destination; my house. The house was covered in @CAPS1 decor and was gleaming with the happiness that each one of us held inside of us. My grandpa was the first to walk in. I leaped into his arms and said ""I love @CAPS13 grandpa with all my heart! Merry @CAPS1!"" @CAPS8 this he smiled and began to tickle me like he always did ever since I was little. He grabbed my hands and began twirling me around, humming his favorite song. As we were twirling to the tune of his favorite song, my laughter broke out. When this happened, I looked straight into my grandpa's eyes and saw the love that he had. He always said that ""The laughter of a young child can always bring joy to anyone, even the cruelest of people."" @CAPS9 we were still twirling, all my other family members walked into the house. They smiled and laughed at us, but we didn't care. This was going to be a great @CAPS1, nothing could ruin it for us. When everyone got into the house we all sat down in the living room sharing stories of all the old and good times that we shared. We all knew that this was what my grandpa needed, and in his eyes we could all see that he was happy that he had a family, that could put away all of the hardships we were going through and allow ourselves to sit as a family and enjoy each other. Everyone was laughing now, remembering the stories that made our family what is was. My aunt @PERSON2 was the one that knew all of them by heart, she could even act them out. My grandpa sat there and laughed. He was filled with enjoyment as he watched his only daughter do what she did best.  When dinner was almost ready, my grandpa and I sat down at the dinner table all by ourselves. We began playing the game that we always played. I got underneath the table and hopped up in random seats acting like a cat. My grandpa would always say "" @CAPS11 down @PERSON1, that food isn't for @CAPS13."" then I would go and sit next to him and meow at his side, and we would just laugh. No one else understood the bond that my grandpa and I had. But that didn't matter, every holiday we were the ones that were always laughing; we enjoyed life and we never let anything @CAPS11 to us. He was the only one in my family that understood enjoyment and he helped me live my life that way.  Dinner was served and we all took our normal seats. My mother's food looked amazing like usual. My grandpa and I sat right across from each other like we always would and made the most unusual faces at each other. Our laughter filled the room and made that @CAPS1 even better. As we were all finishing our dinner, my grandpa got up and walked to the door looking outside at the beautiful landscape covered in a white blanket. I walked to his side and looked up at him. He smiled down at me and said ""@CAPS13 never realize the beautiful things in life, until your life is fading. The most beautiful thing to me is your laugh. It always brings joy to my heart. If I could only hear one more sound, it would be your laugh @PERSON1, and if I could only see one more thing it would be your smile. I'm happy to be your grandpa and I'm glad that I got to live and see @CAPS13 grow up to be such a beautiful and sweet girl. Always remember, enjoy ever moment. Especially the moments with the ones that @CAPS13 love."""
7," The word (laughter) @MONTH1 mean a smile or something nice that has happened to someone or even a thank you, but for many people it means the action or sound of laughing. For many people the felling they get inside when they laugh is the felling of happiness. The sense of felling good inside is the meaning that ones in while you have to be happy in life; have a balance in your life. For me the word (laughter) means being happy and the felling of doing something good in life. For instance when a couple get married they need a sense of laughter in there life's so they can enjoy their companies. It was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2 early in the morning I was extremely exited to leave because that was the day I was going to go visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncle, and cousins that I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time.I was about to leave for two months in a half I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time I felt happy and exited to go. That morning we arrived at the air port; I was about to ride on my very first airplane. As I tried to find my seat through the big line of people that were finding their seats as well; I sat down and buckled my self into the seat and looked out the window and all over the place. My stomach was turning in circles round and round and I had the felling of a roller coaster about to take off really fast. The next thing I knew the plane was moving I got kinda of scared, but at the same time I was excited.  During the flight I felt a sense of laughter in my soul; the memories of a childhood in @LOCATION2 were turning my emotions into laughter and tears that made me fell good I had never felt. The idea of seeing all my family and friend was captivate to my hear and emotions. As we arrived at the @LOCATION1 airport; my emotions were turning in circles back and forth. We only had two more flights left to get to our destinations. I was getting tired and sleepy, my legs and arm's hurt so bad, they felt like if you were caring two big bags of potatoes on each side of my leg and arms . We decided go eat some place as we walked around to see what we could find to eat we found pizza huts. The next thing I knew was that we had only one hour our to the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. As we arrived to the gate people were already going in through the hallway to get into the plane so we hurried. Three hours past buy and we had landed in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 that was our destination. I felt a sense of laughter inside of me as we waited for our ride home; the feeling I got was as if someone had token something from me and gave it back. I started to cry at that moment, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived that late afternoon to my grandparents house, as I looked at them I felt a happy inside, they were happy as well. we decided to spend the @TIME1 over at my grandparents house, that @TIME1 nobody had gone to sleep every one was to busy talking with each other and catching up. The next day every one was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside.  We had spent a mouth in a half with family members that I had not seen in a while we all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an incredible time catching up with family and friend. We did not get to do all the things we wanted to, but the best part was the time I has with my family and friends. The word laughter to me mean the best thing that has happens to you and makes you fell good inside, or even the memories you think about when you are alone and sad, those are the memories that will make you laugh and fell good about yourself. Other people @MONTH1 say that laughter is the felling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best felling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life. Over many generations people have used the benefits of laughter in their life's for instance many famous and non- famous people, important people or non- important. Many people say that when you are not happy you are going to die not knowing what happy is. People really enjoy those moments that they spend with a special someone."
7," @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together."
7," I have heard people say that a smile makes a big difference in a first meeting, a relationship, or just walking past people on the street. If someone has had a bad @CAPS2, not only should a smile make it better, but also some laughter along to accompany that sincere smile. I enjoy walking down the street on a nice, beautiful @CAPS2 and walking by locals I know that smile, laugh, and give a little wave to show that they are enjoying the @CAPS2 as much as I am. Walking past someone I @MONTH1 not know also has its positives. One look to see their face can tell me if they are having a good @CAPS2 or a bad @CAPS2. Either way, I give a smile. A smile to show that it is a good @CAPS2 or a smile of encouragement to let them know it will get better. I enjoy the feeling I get @CAPS12 I meet someone and I know that we connected great. A good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. I now know that I enjoy being around someone like me who enjoys to smile and laugh. I can't really seem to see myself around a serious person and I know if I was, we would clash and have problems because I am loud and if they are serious, there would be problems and not be able to collaborate on decisions.  @CAPS12 I first met my friend @CAPS1, I was nervous and scared because we were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend. It was a @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 double date with our friend and my cousin. @CAPS12 the guys first picked us, I got into the car and the first thing that I remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. I ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk. As the date went on, he seemed like a down to earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face and laughter seemed to flow right out of him. As time went on, we became closer than what I would have ever thought of. I was not sure where our friendship would lead us, but soon after, it became noticeable that he liked me and I liked him. We took it slow, not rushing into things. We had long conversations that would last us hours at a time and we always seemed to laugh about everything. He made everything seem better and better each and every time we talked. Pretty much having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away.  Just the other night , @CAPS1 and @CAPS4, our mutual friend, came over to visit my cousin @PERSON1 and me at her house. We were all laughing and enjoying each others company @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 decided to go to the store and buy some things using @CAPS1's car. Since they weren't going to be gone for long, @CAPS1 and I decided to wait inside. Minutes after that, as we sat, talking to each other, @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 run into the house looking flushed, out of breath, scared and nervous about something. @CAPS4 wouldn't look at us, so @PERSON1 told us to go outside, something had happened to the car. As we stood there, I realized that the car was no where in sight in the driveway, so I became suspicious. We asked them where the car was and they pointed to the road and in the dark all we could see was the faint outline of a car in the ditch. I was expecting @CAPS1 to get mad and say something to @CAPS4, who seemed to not know what to say, but instead he smiled, walked towards the car and said, ""@CAPS11't worry, the car is fine."" @CAPS12 he said that, he started laughing, his amazing laugh. I was still in the state of shock and so @CAPS12 I heard that laugh of his, I turned and looked at him, and realizing that he was happy and didn't seem to mind the accident, I began laughing as well and in less than @NUM1 seconds of him beginning to laugh, not only was it us four laughing, but also two of my other cousins that had joined us outside. Laughter made the situation better and I enjoyed the fact that we could all laugh about the smallest, the unexpected and the worst as well as the best. What also made me happy, was the fact that that very same night after the incident, @CAPS1 asked me the question I was hoping to hear and the way he said it made me laugh which then caused him to laugh. I answered his question with a hug and a yes and he brought out a banquet of roses. As we walked inside, my cousins and my aunt started to applaud and we all started to laugh with smiles on our faces."
7," Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldnt hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Everytime we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS1 day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS1 had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS1 student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS1 person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through."
7,"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said ""jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down,"" or someone will help you built them!  As @PERSON6 said ""come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.""   "
7," Laughter can be a good think and sometimes it could be a sad thing. When me and my family went to @LOCATION3 we went for my two little brothers appointment. We left a little early so we could have some vacation time. When we arrived to where were going we got onto a fairy to go to a island up in @LOCATION1. On are way there my sister @PERSON1 was acting like she was on the titanic she had the dress and everything. My brothers and dad and i just couldn't stop laughing at her because she is eighteen. @CAPS5 while we stayed down there we were at are uncles house and they have a little dog and she was running from it and she fell so hard and my family and i weren't trying to laugh at her but it's kinda hard. After we went to lunch with are uncle and aunt we went to there military base @PERSON1 would not keep here hands off of the jets. What my family and i thought was so funny is @PERSON1 is eighteen and the rest of us are fourteen or younger so i guess we just like to pick on @LOCATION2. When we went to @LOCATION3 it was the night before the boy's appointment and are family and us went to the under ground tour of @LOCATION3. Well after that was all done we went to the gift shop that come's up at the end of the tour well @PERSON1 buys a pin that said something no so good and after she bought it are @CAPS4 had seen it she threw it away because she doesn't like things like that but @PERSON1 pulled out of the trash. After that all of us got hungry so we went to this place where they sale some really @CAPS1 tacos and we got a order and we sat down well we also got some sodas and my other sister and i took a bite of are food and took a drink of are food @CAPS5 @PERSON1 says ""oh my gosh there are two really hot guys right there"" @CAPS5 sierra take the biggest gulp of tapattao and i don't remember what @PERSON1 said but she said something and it made me and sierra bust up laughing and we spit are food all over @LOCATION2 she gets up and screams. So of course are parents and family don't want to be there anymore because we embarrassed them so we all started to walk up to the car and right when are uncle @PERSON3 yelled @PERSON1 don't fall because thins is where i fell all you hear is are sister falling behind us is was so funny. What made it even more funny was that me and sierra just started to stop laughing and oh my goodness we were laughing the whole way to the car. Are whole way home @PERSON1 was mad at us because we were still laughing at her but we went to the beach she was over it. I think when we went to the beach that was the place where we started to bond a lot more because we were all playing no cell phones lots of picture rock climbing that was fun we left @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS2 behind a couple of times @CAPS5 @PERSON2 tried to keep throwing me into the water so i would pushed him back @CAPS5 @PERSON2 threw a rock at @LOCATION2 and she fell over. When we were all taking a picture on a @CAPS1 log we were all shaking it and @PERSON1 sierra and i all fell of and i hurt my arm so we had to go to the doctors. A month after we got home are @CAPS4 took @PERSON1, sierra, aunt @PERSON4 and i to @CAPS3 on ice and that was probably the best time of my life. Are @CAPS4 says ""i don't know what's funnier @PERSON1 waving to the actors on the ice that cant see her in the dark or the show."" @CAPS5 are aunt said""yeah thank you @CAPS6 for making me sit next to her."" @CAPS5 when the cartoon toys story came on sierra and i said""look @PERSON1 what are you doing on the ice arena and she thought that we were talking about the pig and we were all no the little troll and @CAPS4 and aunt @PERSON4 just busted up laughing it was hilarious. When we went home we were all talking about it and laughing and she got mad because were always making fun of her because she is short but when it comes to us she thinks its so funny. There is a lot of laughter in our family and i cant wait to have more in it so that when i grow up I'll have a lot of good memories beside me and I'll still look back like i am now and I'll say wow what good times i have had since i grew up. When we are family laughs together i think that is the time when we actually communicate"
7," Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the ""@CAPS5"" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have ""@CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part."
7," I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories."
7," People always say that the worst parts of life are the sad parts, the moments where no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments trump the problems caused by work, or by the society, and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone is feeling joy so strong that it pours out of them in the way of a suppressed giggle or booming laugh, are the times that make life worth living, worth the jobs and the bad breakups and the over priced society. It has been said by those infamous ""they"" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones remembered forever because they hold the most emotion, but i have to disagree with ""them"". Moments in the life whether they be seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished also if they are built up by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently was my birthday. This year it fell on a @DATE1 and I had made no plans to celebrate in any way. Sure my parents had gotten me loads of presents but the joy and jittery excitement that i had always felt previous to my birthday wasn't in me. These feelings were most likely because this year i had decided that now that i was in high school, birthday parties were a no go. With no plans or exciting activities to await, my birthday was not eagerly looked forward to as it had been every year previous. What would i do?! I definitely didn't want to spend the day home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what i did almost every other normal @DATE1. These thoughts and realizations brought that sad lonely feeling in me, those feelings that make up the worst parts of life. My mom, noticing my birthday gloom, suggested a trip to the beach and a one night stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go as far as to say that its my favorite place in the world. I also love yurts. Yurts are big round cabins made from canvas draped around a wood structure, with a skylight directly at the top of the pointed roof where you could see the stars at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach sounded better to me then being at home, so naturally I agreed to the beach trip. Way deep down I was excited, I was thrilled, a beach trip with my family! In my head I was stuck still in my foggy state of gloom as thoughts swirled in my head about how I would not have a good time if there were no friends to laugh and hang out with, and how much of a loser I was for not doing anything with friends but instead my family. Our household consists of my mom, dad, and two sisters ages four and @NUM1 months. We are not the most well functioning family. I find my older sister to be an annoying brat sent by the devil to ruin my life and make everything my fault. Two out of the three of us girls have to always be in some kind of brawl, and that drives my mother crazy which gets her all flustered and my dad angry until we realize that buzz light year has ruffled all of our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined my family birthday beach trip to turn out like, but caused by a long car drive and hungry kids rather than buzz light year.  The day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mom, bless her, made a family announcement to us that today was my day and anything I wanted was what I got. This meant that I got to choose what we would eat, what we would do and could make any comment including telling my little sisters to bug off if i wanted to. By lunch, we had visited the beach, gotten settled in our yurt, and enjoyed a lunch made up of various snacks we had brought along and I found that I was enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised a voice, make a snarky comment or do anything to upset the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all its odd fish i laughed. I laughed at my sisters when they were doing silly things. I laughed at the things my mother told me. We all laughed at a bicyclist running into a pole, and fish doing vacuum like motions with their lips. All the laughing, all the smiles did a lot for me. It pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me to see all of the love that circled around in my family, it made the love visible. Its healthy to laugh. Without laughter in our lives, some things like love, that can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter. "
7," When younger adults tell kids that the more you laugh the longer you will live or that it will add @NUM1 years on to your life time. Is this true? I personally live by the aspect of laughter. Making people laugh has gotten me many great friends even best friends, maybe even a few boyfriends. Any relationship no matter weather its just friendly or you like the person is brought together through laughter. Meaning that laughter can always ease some tension between two people or even a group of people. When I first started school I used laughter to make new friends, and to get them to like me. When I was in kinder-garden I was on the bus with a girl named @PERSON1 and I wanted to say something to her but I wasn't sure what to say so I decided to go with a joke. Of course it made her laugh then her laughing made me laugh. We laughed until one of us got off the bus, it happened to be her that got off the bus first. She was still laughing when she stepped off the bus. I wondered if that would be the only time we would talk. Little did I know it was the start of a great friendship. When I got home I told my mom all about what happened and then she asked if I met any new friends at school. I told her all about what happened on the bus and she told me that with my jokes she would be surprised if I didn't have a million friends by the end of the week.  The very next day when I got on the bus guess who I saw, @PERSON1, sitting there smiling and waving to me to come sit with her, so I went and sat down next to her. She asked me to tell her that joke I told her yesterday. I then told her the joke then she told me one of her jokes, we laughed tell we got to school. That whole day we were inseparable. We sat next to each other at story time and at snack time and then again on the bus ride home. It turned out it wasn't just that day we would be inseparable it was the whole school year and that whole @DATE1 fallowing that we were like two peas in a pod. When the next school year rolled around we found out we weren't in the same class any more and we only got to hang out on the bus and at recess cause we were in the first grade and we got recess then. For the next few years it would be this way where we only got to hang out while on the bus or out on the play ground. After a few years our bus routs changed and we then no longer rode the same bus but we still knew we were best friends cause we still had that best friend bond. On special weekends if we were lucky and good little girls our parents would let us go to each others houses to play and hang out, we would usually talk them into letting us stay the night too. We had many more funny moments, more then I can describe.  Once we got to middle school we hung out more and had the same friends, we even participated in the same activities such as band and sports. During those last few years tell high school we were close again. Us being the two goof balls that we are made a few more friends that liked the same sports and actives we did and thought the same jokes were funny that we thought were funny. We would all get together after a sporting even and talk about what happened during the game and laugh about the funny things that happened to us or the other team and maybe crack a few jokes about someone on the other team, you know girls just being girls. Activities like this went on tell right before high school started. Since high school started @PERSON1 and I still keep in touch, we have had a few classes together here and there but not a whole lot.  Hanna and I are still friends to this day and it wouldn't have been for that day on the bus where I decided to crack a joke and make her laugh for us to become friends. People usually say that it all started with a laugh or a joke. Laughter really can bring two people together, weather you stay friends for a long time or just a year, you can always recall how you met that person. I can actually say that I have made almost all my friends through laughter. As far as laughter makes you live longer goes, who knows. I'm only a junior in high school and have many more years on me. Everyone says that they don't ever not see me laughing or smiling, so lets hope it helps you live longer."
7," I tapped @CAPS4 foot nervously as the comedian stepped down from the stage. The audience's applause was strong but brief--more polite than appreciative. I use the term ""audience"" loosely, as at least four fifths of the people who were sitting before the stage were also comedians. Only five people were brave enough to show up without any intent of participating themselves. At that moment, all I could think about was how much I wished I was one of them, but I wasn't. I had to perform. The comedian was replaced by the announcer, and @CAPS4 foot's tapping became a relentless pounding. Looking back, I didn't really have a reason to be as distressed as I was. The audience was sparse at best, and they couldn't have had high expectations. If they had, why would they have come to an open-mic on the seventh floor of a public service building? I knew all this at the time, but knowing didn't diminish @CAPS4 anxiety. Stage fright is an irrational, primal fear, and such fears rarely yield to logic. Thus @CAPS4 panic swelled, even as the announcer called me to the stage. Then it happened. Shortly after ascending the stage, I became aware of the announcer's silence. The audience was focused on me; I was expected to speak. In that instant I forgot everything I had memorized. The routine I had so diligently practiced over the past few days completely fled @CAPS4 mind. It hadn't been a very good routine, but it had been something to hold onto. Now it was gone. The audience wanted something from me that I no longer had.  @CAPS4 brain scrambled for leverage, for anything that could be used to extricate myself from the situation I had found myself in. The microphone! It was still on the stand. I slowly took the microphone into @CAPS4 hands and deliberately set the stand aside. However that only bought me a few seconds; I needed to do better than that. Searching deeper, @CAPS4 brain turned to @CAPS4 comedy education. @CAPS4 education, like @CAPS4 routine, had been brief and unspectacular. However a few key things stuck out, among them one of the very first things I had learned. ""All comedy stems from negative opinion,"" @CAPS4 teacher had constantly repeated during our private lessons. ""All @CAPS1 gotta do in stand-up is complain."" That was it. I had found @CAPS4 way out. Immediately, I put on an indignant voice and began to speak. ""@CAPS1 know what I hate most?"" I demanded, even as I struggled to find the answer myself. However @CAPS4 brain was gaining momentum, it was no longer frozen as it had been a few moments ago. I realized that the announcer had miss-pronounced @CAPS4 last name. Choosing this fact as the thing I detested most in the world, I sneered, ""@CAPS2 people say @CAPS3-man!"" I don't know why, maybe it was because @CAPS4 relatively young voice sounded funny, or perhaps it was because I had packed those four words with such condescension. For whatever reason, the audience laughed. ""@CAPS4 last name is @CAPS5,"" I cried with outrage, emboldened by this new-found encouragement. I proceeded to rebuke the announcer for his grave error and even went so far as to denounce all of the people in the world who couldn't be bothered to pronounce people's names correctly. Once again, @CAPS4 ludicrous rant was met with laughter. Upon hearing this laughter, I realized I had already succeeded. If the audience would laugh at @CAPS4 crudely improvised remarks, surely they would do the same for @CAPS4 meticulously crafted jokes. With this reassurance in mind, @CAPS4 preparations came back to me as if I had never forgotten them. @CAPS4 confidence renewed, I told everything from the beginning. I launched into a criticism of @LOCATION1's polluted sky and crowed streets. Yet the audience wasn't interested in the content of @CAPS4 presentation. They were interested in the loud, indignant kid before them who stubbornly refused to let anything satisfy him.  I continued to play the part I had created for myself with increasing enthusiasm. Yet before I had even gotten through half @CAPS4 material, the red light turned on. I had one minute left to finish. Rather than struggling to fill @CAPS4 five minutes of time as I had anticipated, I instead found myself with much more to say. I had created an engrossing dialogue with the audience that was every bit as hard to break away from as an actual conversation. Nevertheless, I made only a few snide comments before returning the microphone. As I started to step down from the stage, I was surprised to be met with a sizable applause. It was the loudest shout the audience had produced all night, though the acoustics of the stage @MONTH1 have influenced its volume. It was quite clear that the audience had found what they were looking for in me, and I found myself remembering @CAPS4 teacher's words once again. ""The audience doesn't just come for the jokes, they come for the person. Anyone can be a comedian if they can show their interesting side."""
7,"  Everything in life that is worth is not easy to achieve. Sometimes you have to try something you've never done before or do something you don't want to do to get the reward or outcome that you want. @CAPS4 was a hot @DATE1 day in the middle of @DATE2. My friend @PERSON1 called me and said that him and his brother are going to a swimming spot called blue horn. @CAPS5 said there is cliffs we can jump off and rapids that we can swim down. This sounded very intriguing. I told him I was up for @CAPS4. @CAPS5 picked me up from my house and we made our way to blue horn.  When we first got there i was surprised because we had to go on a two mile hike that @CAPS5 didn't tell me about. I didn't bring any walking shoes all i had with me were some sandals. This was already looking like a terrible day. We started walking down this long trail that had four or five spots where there was a so much deep, @CAPS1 mud that we had to make a separate path through the bushes so we could get around. Then we get to this really steep hill. When i say steep i mean you can't walk down this hill without having to break into a full sprint or try to stop and most likely start tumbling down the hill. @CAPS4 was all dirt and a couple trees on this hill nothing to hold on to. So what we did was slide down to the first tree and then to the second tree which was about halfway down the hill then we just bolted down the rest of the hill. When i got down the hill all i was thinking was how are we supposed to get back up that? A few minutes later we finally reached our destination. I was hot and sweat and ready to swim. I took of my shirt and set my bag down. I walked over to where @PERSON1 was and looked down at the water. At least @NUM1 feet i was thinking, @CAPS2 what i said was ""@CAPS3 this is nothing""""@CAPS4 gets better"" @PERSON1 replied @CAPS5 pointed up to this tree that had a very rigid board nailed onto some branches that appeared to be a support structure for someone to stand on. I was not planning on jumping off of this wooden plank, @CAPS2 then when @PERSON1 did @CAPS4 i was hoping maybe @CAPS4's not so terrifying when your actually up there. I was blatantly wrong every time i looked down at the water @CAPS4 seems as if i were to jump and never hit the ground. I couldn't be a coward and get down so i figured the only way to get down was to by just leaping off bravely. I counted to three and right as i got to three i stepped forward to leap off and i could feel the warm breeze on my face and the adrenaline pumping through my veins. Before i knew @CAPS4 i hit the water and all those heroic and amazing feelings quickly turned to pain and regret. I had managed to land partially on my back. We got out of the water and @PERSON1 saw my back and said ""@CAPS7 your back is so red!"" I was in a lot of pain @CAPS2 through all this pain @CAPS4 was still so much fun while @CAPS4 lasted and we had a good laugh about @CAPS4 all.  Next up was the rapids. We decided to go down these feet first. The water moves very fast so @CAPS4 carries you like you are a tiny leaf. There was rocks that stuck out of the water that we tried to avoid and there were some rocks hidden below the water that we wish we would have avoided. @CAPS4 was so fun @CAPS2 there was also a lot of pain involved. The entire time we were looking over at each other just abrupt in laughter. Once we got down all the rapids there was a miniature waterfall we swam over to this waterfall and climbed to the top took a seat right on top and just started talking about the day. When we first arrived i thought this was a bad idea coming and i wished i would have made an excuse and not came. After all the hiking and all the troubles getting there when we finally arrived at the cliffs i was scared to jump off, @CAPS2 one reason why me and @PERSON1 are such good friends is because we aren't afraid to take risks to have a good time. Sometimes this lands us in a lot of trouble though! In this case we took the risk to throw our bodies off and could seriously injure ourselves just for the laugh and the thrilling experience. Laughter and excitement don't come from sitting on the couch watching @CAPS9 @CAPS4 comes from going out and trying new things and having a good time. To me that is always worth the risk."
7," @CAPS1 one laugh @CAPS1 one laugh is all my mom asked from me and my dad, yes laughing is a simple thing that everyone in the world does and everyone enjoys but for me and my dad laughing together will rarely happen and @CAPS2 it did happen it would be ""@CAPS3 milagro"" as my mom says.  This all changed when my mom decided to go to @LOCATION1 with my little brother to go see my grandpa because he was very ill and leave me and my dad to have some daughter/father bonding time.My mom was ecstatic about this idea because she thought that me and my dad would get along better, and maybe @CAPS1 maybe get that true laugh that came from our hearts that my mom wants.   I could see the happiness that was beaming on my beautiful mom's face, her face was bright and her black beading eyes @CAPS1 starring down @CAPS7 me and all i could think of saying was ""@CAPS4 mom. don't worry we'll be fine."" I wanted to make this all work out and show my mom that me and my dad could have a perfect relationship, but this was harder than i thought. We fought all the time and argued for any little thing and we were @CAPS1 two bombs ticking ready to @CAPS1 explode.  I would lie on my bed looking up @CAPS7 my cracked up white ceiling thinking of ways to apologize to my dad so everything would be @CAPS1 fine. I've always wanted one of those miraculous endings in those sad movies when the daughter was a rebel and the father was the nice guy and @CAPS7 the end of every and each of those movies they would become one more step closer and the father would give the daughter a hug that made her feel secure and that no one was going to hurt her. I think all along that's what i wanted, to receive that long hug from my dad to make me feel loved by him. Weeks passed and my mom wasn't coming back for another two weeks so i thought to myself, @CAPS2 my dad is not going to make the first move then i am! and that's exactly how it happened. I complimented my dad everyday and i know, it probably sounds silly but it worked for me.He didn't laugh but he did smile, his smile gave me satisfaction, it made me feel victorious when i saw that smile of his wrinkled up face and something told me that those smiles he flashed @CAPS7 me were coming from his heart. This all changed when we hit @DATE1, in @LOCATION2 it is said that once @CAPS5 hit a new year @CAPS5 get a new life and when @CAPS5 get that new life @CAPS5 receive a special gift. The gift of love.I personally didn't believe that, i thought how can @CAPS5 get a new life @CAPS2 @CAPS5 already made up your own?  But yes, i have to say this is true and i learned this with my dad. It was the a few days after new years everything was calm between us and we @CAPS1 talked about the basic things a daughter and a father could talk about school and what did I'd want to eat.Until one afternoon we were walking outside and it was pretty cold every time time i breathed out a slow and steady breath i felt that my breath would @CAPS1 freeze and fall into a million pieces. We walked started to walk towards my house and the unexpected happened, my dad said the words that I've been wanting to hear for over years""@CAPS5 know what, @CAPS5 mean the world to me and @CAPS5 will forever be my little princess @CAPS8 @CAPS2 @CAPS5 get old!""@CAPS7 that precise moment i didn't know either to cry or hug him, it was some what shocking for me.Could the thing that i was longing for for happen @CAPS7 this moment? and yes it did. I gave my dad a hug that felt that lasted for over an hour but actually, it was only one minute. But that minute was an eternity for me, i felt that safe with him i was a warmness in my heart and i knew we could over come anyone and anything. That was an amazing moment for me and him too, but then the after was the worse.That security and peace that i felt @CAPS7 the beginning was all crushed, my heart was crushed when my dad told me my grandpa passed away. @CAPS7 that moment i wanted to throw up how could somethings so beautiful @CAPS1 happen and be ruined into this horrendous news.I did learn a lesson, laughter is the shortest distance between people. Now i laugh with my dad most of the time and i always laughed with my beloved grandfather,@CAPS8 @CAPS2 my grandfather was away over the phone we would laugh @CAPS7 all of our memories. Laughter changed my relationship with my dad, it made it closer and we now have a better communication and i found peace."
7," The sunset shimmers off of the sparkling water in @LOCATION1, where seven bald eagles perch high in the limbs of a bare spruce tree.This phenomenon occurs every day in the @DATE1 of a remote town called @LOCATION1, nestled in the heart of the mountains, and located on the southeast peninsula of the great state of @LOCATION2. Dad, @CAPS1 and I travel to @LOCATION1 annually, where my dad owns a wharf called the @CAPS2's @CAPS3. My sister and i usually travel with him to spend time with our grandparents, who have maintained a permanent residence in @LOCATION1 since my dad was a young boy. We also go to enjoy the great amenities this area has to offer, both business and pleasure. We go crabbing, commercial fishing, hunting and boating, but also enjoy hiking on the various mountain trails, located directly in the backyard. My sister and I busk every year, setting a guitar or violin case out and playing our instruments for the thousands of people that come into this waterfront town from the humongous cruise ships, to make a sufficient profit.On one particular memorable occasion, something happened that if laughter was not an element of, there would of been a totally different outcome.  This story takes place when my sister and i had just finished playing for the tourists and we biked over to our dad's dock. This is late in the @TIME1, and we are going to our grandparents home. But, @CAPS5 veers off from the highway and stops the small truck we are in. My father gets out of the vehicle, and tells my sister to hop in the drivers seat. She is visibly excited to try and drive this ancient @ORGANIZATION1 pickup, and puts the truck into gear. The vehicle suddenly lurches and in a flash, the engine sputters, and dies. Inquisitively, @CAPS1 looks at him and @CAPS5 replies in a calm tone that this model is a stick shift . Then, my dad looks back to see me squished against the rear window, lodging myself for her next driving attempt, and tells me to give it a try. Cautiously I ease in the clutch, barely pressing the gas pedal, and start a steady crawl. And instantly, the truck dies. Several days later, my sister leaves on a five day excursion, crabbing as a deckhand for my uncle. I have gone down for a couple days in her absence, busking on my own. On one day back to the house, my dad stops on the remote road again, and stops, getting out of the drivers seat. I get in, trying my very best to not expose my nervousness, and strap in. The pickup lurches as though stung by a bee, my dad purposely mushing his head and stiffening his neck into the head rest. Sheepishly, I put the truck into motion, and ease out the clutch as slowly as possible. In doing so, the accomplishment and swiftness startles me, and the engine chokes and goes out.  Throughout the course of three more days, after each days activities, I would drive a fair stretch of road, with hills, stoplights and other obstacles. Although the driving age is @NUM1, and I am of that age, it is illegal to drive without a permit in any country or state.My sister, after several days of strenuous crabbing, comes back and on the way home, we stop again at the designated driving spot. She gets the @ORGANIZATION1 moving for about ten feet, but when it comes time to increase speed, the engine coughs. @CAPS1 and I switch, and I play with the fact that she does not know that I have been driving for about a week. I falsely try to familiarize myself with the brake, gas and clutch and intentionally kill the motor, propelling us forward. Then, I cleanly start the truck, and professionally drive off, going onto the highway, and onto the severe hill where on the top, my grandparents three story house is.   As I get out of the drivers seat, I can see my sister extremely distraught in the back seat. She is literally in tears, because as departed from the wheel, my father said with a sense of pride swelling in his voice, ""that's my boy, you really have a driving knack, just like your old man."" @CAPS5 said this as to further provoke the hilarity of the situation, but it just pushed my sister over the edge. She storms out of the cab, and marches up the stairs of our grandparents house. My dad and I sit, perplexed at her severe emotional level, and then I go up and tell her, saying that i have practiced for every day she has been gone, and it was all a joke.My sister looks at me, stunned, then a sly grin creeps on to her face. She breaks out in laughter, and I then realize if @CAPS1 had reacted any differently, this story could have taken a different toll due to the illegal component, but mainly this incident could have ended in a ghastly way, her telling mom."
7,"                      Laughter   @CAPS1 are times when you need to laugh, more than anything. For me @CAPS1 was one day in particular, it's not like someone died, or was hurt, nothing tragic happened, but it was very hard for me. I'm the worst heart breaker. I guess I just wasn't made for it or something, but that day I broke up with my boy friend. It was the first time I'd ever broken up with anyone. We'd dated for a little over eight months and I know that that's not forever, but it still felt like a long time. It was my first significant relationship, of course eventually I did have my reasons to break up with him. I remember I had made a whole speech to explain, I didn't say any of it. Thirty minutes later @ORGANIZATION1 cal led. I remember holding my cell phone, clutching it to my face, I wasn't sure if I really wanted to go, but then again I didn't want to stay home. I needed to get out of the house, needed to be with other people, needed to get it off my mind. When @ORGANIZATION1 called me back I told her my mom had said it was okay if I went then I went into my room to get ready. I remember looking at myself in the mirror. I had cried all my make-up off when I'd been explaining everything to my sister, I had mascara and smudged eyeliner around the under side of my eyes; they looked sunken in and tired, my nose was red from walking home, I saw where I'd rubbed foundation away when I'd tried to get rid of tears, my hair which had been braided an hour before was tangled and wild thanks to the wind. Normally this all would have bothered me, but that day I just didn't care. I washed my face and put on a sweatshirt and jeans, @ORGANIZATION1 had told me that it would be cold at the carnival. I remember packing the stuff I needed to spend the @TIME1, a toothbrush, pajamas, cell phone charger etc. @ORGANIZATION1's mom came and picked me up, and then we picked up @ORGANIZATION1. On the car ride over to the carnival @ORGANIZATION1 and I talked about the ""break up"". I basically told her what happened and she did what best friends are supposed to do, she listened, gave input, and then listened some more. I remember by the time we reached the carnival I didn't want to talk anymore, and @ORGANIZATION1 could tell so she gave me one of the best nights of my life.  The first thing we did was simply look around, I remember @ORGANIZATION1 making jokes, both of us walked around swinging our arms around funny. We walked and looked at a bunch of booths, I remember laughing at everything because somehow @ORGANIZATION1 made it all seem like the funniest thing in the world. Eventually we decided to use some of the money that her mom gave us to buy some tickets for games. We took turns playing, I remember at first we were both awful at everything we tried, we ended up laughing at ourselves because both of us had terrible aim and no arm muscle, which you needed at least one of those for almost all the games. Eventually we came to the game where you had to throw a hammer down and hit this little platform to make this metal piece go up and ring the bell at the top of the pole, amazingly enough @ORGANIZATION1 managed to win. She won a big plastic hammer that she then gave to me, then after that I won her a monkey by tossing these balls up into these large target holes. We laughed so hard, we were so surprised we won anything. After that we decided to look around some more. That's when we found the photo booth. @ORGANIZATION1 was ecstatic. I remember her saying, ""We have to @LOCATION1, we have to!"" and then shove me inside. So we took pictures and they were really fun, it's surprising how fun making funny faces and starring into a camera can be. After each picture we would burst out laughing, I laughed so hard that my stomach ached. @ORGANIZATION1 would laugh big, like it was ripped out of her, I would laugh big too but mine would always sound more like a cackle. We took two sets of picture so that each of us could have a copy, I still keep mine on my binder. @CAPS1 are days that you really need to laugh and that day for me was a big one, I remember when I went to sleep that @TIME1 being so happy. I hadn't thought about anything bad all @TIME1, it had made me feel so much better just being able to laugh. Laughing @MONTH1 not be the cure but it helps. Just laughing all @TIME1 with my best friend helped so much. Just laughing, smiling, having a good time and not worrying. That day made me realize how important laughter can be.  "
7,"                  Opportunities                 Someone once said ""laughter is the best medicine."" In any situation I have been in I have been able to use laughter to my advantage, to cheer people up, mend friendships, or even when I am having the funnest day of my life. Where ever I go I have my voice, laughter makes my life more fulfilling and fresh. Peoples memories that stick with them are happy moments in their life. When you look back on your childhood and life that you have passed, pictures of smiling people pop up in your mind. Family members, friends, even strangers throughout your day can impact you just by a laugh.     I started to laugh when i was born. Its something that no matter who you are, you have @CAPS4. Some more than others but @CAPS4 is there. For me, i got a little more then the normal amount. Laughing has got me through awkward times, amazing times, and just about every moment I have with people, I laugh. The one time i remember where just a little laugh made the future footprints of my life, @DATE1. @CAPS4 was @CAPS1 break and I was waiting for a call. One single call that would either change my life or make me feel like i did not do good enough to make my goal become success. Looking back on all the questions they had asked me during the interview, thinking about how nervous I was but i just lightened the mood by smiling and laughing, hoping i had been the ""chosen one."" @CAPS2, a couple days after that interview i got the call.     I picked up the phone and said ""hello?"" just one word and they could tell that my heart was thumping into my throat. I was so afraid to know what the next thing they were going to say. @CAPS4 was either going to have the word congratulations or sorry in @CAPS4 and i didn't want to guess which one @CAPS4 was. I sat there in shock as everything around me became blurred, all I could get out of my body was "" are you serious?"" I felt like I could have had another word from my dictionary come out but @CAPS4 got a laugh out of them and a laugh out of me too. They told me that after @TIME1, my life will be turned upside-down and pulled left and right and change entirely.     After finding out that I was going to be leaving everything I know behind. I knew I made the right choice. @CAPS4 will change me, my life, my entire future, and I am ready for that. I started the final application process and had meetings and greetings. Finishing the application and sending @CAPS4 in made my name as a contestant to an exchange student. All of the camps I have gone to so far have already started to change my thought on things. The one memory that I will always remember is the first time I met everyone else becoming an exchange student and the exchange students here already, because @CAPS4 made me put myself out there and meet them all. The long conversations with them I will cherish. Making jokes, laughing, and talking made @CAPS4 the best trip ever. When we went on a ski trip laughing got us through the six hour bus ride and kept us awake. that @DATE2 was the @DATE2 where we all found out where we are going and some people didn't get exactly where they wanted to spend a year. Laughing eased those people that cried. I wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but I got my second choice, @LOCATION2. At first when I found out I was in awe. I was for sure I would get @LOCATION1 but after thinking about @CAPS4, @LOCATION2 was perfect for me.     Learning the language is challenging, but worth @CAPS4. A little laugh through the lessons always helps me and makes me more confident. Six months from now (@DATE4 thirty first or @DATE3 first) I will be on a plane to my new home for a year. A year that will change my whole world. @CAPS3 is the best thing that has happened to me so far, @CAPS4 is the biggest goal I set for myself and I have already added more goals to my list. @CAPS3 opportunity wouldn't have happened without me pushing myself and making @CAPS4 fun. I tell myself everyday that if there is something I want to do in life, I can do @CAPS4. I just need to believe in myself and don't get down. My mom and dad have always said "" if you fall down, you get back up, and you keep doing so until you have done what you were wanting to achieve."" @CAPS3 one thing has always stuck to me and I don't settle for things now, I push to do the best, even if @CAPS4 means falling down along the way. Laughter is truly the best medicine, @CAPS4 helps people get through anything and makes them stronger. Whenever you are down, look up, and laugh."
7,"                               Laughter ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". This quote stands true in every way imaginable. There are two types of laughter, in which both, once again, this quote couldn't be the slightest bit more true. The innocent and funny type of laughter is the more appreciated one. This kind is practically harmless; I mean, who doesn't love a good laugh? I would claim insanity if laughter were not practiced daily in my life. Though this type of laughter consists of very few flaws, in which include a grand core workout and the occasional tears, don't forget that there is still @CAPS1 type.  There are some troubled people in this world we live on that just find it extremely hard to get a good laugh at something that actually has some humor in it. This people tend to cross the line of innocent and funny laughing. They, for some strange reason, find it just hilarious to put down other people. Its almost as if they just hate their lives so much that they want to bring as many peers as they can, down with them. This type of laughter is cruel. Personally I find the second type of laughter completely idiotic, and refuse to take any part in such a thing. Laughing is something that I enjoy doing, every single day, no matter what. It is good for your soul, and can change your entire world upside down, usually for the better. I find it an extremely important element to live a happy life. Without it, you're just a lonely rock in the middle of the desert with not a single thing to do. Since I know that I will laugh every single day, until the day I cant, I am going to share a story, that I hope will make you laugh, because it sure made me.  It all started as a bland, boring day. Who on earth would have known that in just minutes, my whole perspective on this plain day, would change. My abs were just moments away from receiving a beautiful workout. The best they've had since freshman year @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 unforgettable memory was going to be made on this day, and yet, I had no idea. I am still unaware of why my mother just happened to choose this day, of all days, to be annoying. But aware or unaware, she still did. Now I know that it is typical for a teenage girl like myself, to think of her mother as annoying. But this time, she really was intentionally annoying me. On a computer chair, I sat, and on an exercising ball, my mother sat. While I was just minding my own business, my mother just couldn't help but to bounce over and watch my every move. Though I tried pleading her to stop leaning over my shoulder, and annoying me, she just refused to budge. My supposedly ""mature"" mom just sat there making irritating noises, laughing as if somehow there were the slightest bit of humor in this situation. I found nothing funny about this. It was just ridiculous.  Taking a more kind approach, didn't exactly help either. I nicely asked her, in a repetitive way, to just simply leave me alone. When this failed, I couldn't think of anything else to do, except ignore her. For this I did. But to no surprise, this also didn't help. It were as if nothing I attempted would convince her to stop. My own mother, acting as if she were five years old, pleading for attention, and not stopping. By far the most irritating thing on the planet.  At this point the whole ""nice approach"" was a lost cause. I was going to stand my ground, and get this annoying woman trapped in a five year old's body, off my back. My way of wording got a little more harsh. Instead of asking nicely, I told. And once again, she thought that it was humorous, and refused to stop.  They way my mother was acting that night, is a perfect example of that cruel laughter. It's only funny when everyone involved finds it worth laughing at. I didn't find the woman standing over my shoulder, acting like a child, funny at all. What happened next, on the other hand..was definitely worth laughing at!  As my mother sits on the ball bouncing like an idiot, right over my shoulder, she gets this intelligent idea. She decides that trying to bounce backwards would be extremely fun(and more annoying). Putting this amazing plan into action, the ball slips out from under her not so much five year old body. Her hitting the floor probably didn't exactly feel the best, but the intensive burst of laughter that came after sure did. Although my mother's plan failed completely, we both got a kick out of the outcome.  Since that day, she hasn't randomly thought up any ideas that involved bouncing on a ball and irritating me. That day was great, because we both got a good laugh, and she no longer annoys me. For that, I am grateful."
7," Have you ever thought of laughter as more then just laughing at a funny joke? Well it's a lot more then that. First I'm going yo talk about how laughter is an important part of many relationships either with friends, family, boyfriends or girlfriends. Second is to entertain people with your jokes and laughter. Third to break the ice when things are getting a little awkward and bring it up with laughter. Finally people laugh to cover up their really feeling inside. There's a lot about laughter that people don't know about so lets show you what laughter is all about now. In relationships you really wouldn't think that laughter is an important part of anyone's relationship. Any relationships that you @MONTH1 have with your friends, family, or your loved ones one thing you have in common is laughing because it makes you happy. When you're ever with your family or friends you want to have a good time, and come you know you cant go a day without laughing with them about something that you heard yesterday. When you're with your boyfriend or girlfriend you want to make them smile and you want them to have a good time when there with you. I like when guys make me laugh but that's just me though I laugh a lot and at anything that's really funny. One way people do for a living is to entertain people by making them laugh so hard because everybody likes a good laugh. People that love to make other people smile and laugh then they should become a comedian, because if you like would you do then show the world what you got right? I think its funny guys say that there really good at telling joke but once there joke its not even funny at all. I like to laugh and have a really good time so i like when people make me laugh so I'm not bored. I was watching this show one time and there was this famous comedian on his name was @PERSON1 and he was really funny every time I watch his watch show he makes me laugh so much its not even funny. When I grow up I would like to become of comedian never mind I don't think I have the skills to be in that kind of busy but I could be funny some times. When you're on a date or anything and you guys don't have anything to talk about things get a little awkward and that's not really a fun date to be on. You don't want the date to get all boring so to break the ice you should start a conversation make your date laugh, tell some jokes anything to make the date more exciting. Sometimes when you meet a new friends and you want to get to know them more, so hang out get to know them make them feel like they can have a fun time when there with you and not make them feel like its weird to be around you. I was at my house one time and i got this call but it was a blocked number and this answer, he was just telling me jokes and these other it was funny i was laughing so hard but i didn't want it to get awkward so I started a conversation with the guy it was pretty funny. You how people say jokes and it really hurts the other persons feeling and they just laugh along because they don't want to show how it really hurts them on the inside. You might not know that there hurting because there laughing to but I someone there saying mean jokes about you, you wouldn't like it either. It might be funny to other people but not to the person there talking about. Its funny people tell jokes about other people but sometimes you go a little over board with it sometimes and that's when you need to stop.its hurts a lot of people when you make fun of them and they can get really depressed with all that emotions running around in them. I watched a lot of famous comedians talk about other famous stars telling jokes about them and celebrities get made and other think its funny. Some people just don't like when people tell jokes about them because it really does hurt there feelings. Well I told you everything that I know about laughter and everything that makes laughing fun. I told you about funny and not so funny parts of laughter, the ups and downs. Lets see what we have learned. First that laughter is a big part of a relationship. Second how people like to entertain other people with laughter and enjoyment. Third how to break the ice when things get a little awkward. Finally why it hurts to tell to mean jokes about people when you would feel the same way if they told a mean joke about you because you wouldn't like it either. Well that's all I have to say about laughter."
7," Some people like making people laugh, I love it. I will do most anything to get a good laugh. I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being ""special"" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh."
7," Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it."
7," Laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder that @CAPS7 is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @CAPS8 a reminder that even though we @MONTH1 make mistakes, @CAPS7 is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the @DATE1, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 was nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the @TIME1, and I was to be back no later then nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before @CAPS1. Neither of us knew @CAPS13 to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on @LOCATION1. This turned out to be a big problem, considering @CAPS6 knew this piece of information. @CAPS6 didn't have a problem with it, but @PERSON1, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @CAPS7. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the @CAPS1 tree first, and go from @CAPS7. We both had @CAPS3, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @CAPS14 name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty @CAPS12 looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @PERSON2 got on the @CAPS4 to talk to @PERSON1 for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @PERSON3 and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @PERSON4, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between @PERSON4 and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS6 was like a bad drug that got @CAPS14 really high, and then dropped @CAPS14 like a rock. @CAPS6 was extremely controlling. @CAPS6 wasn't @CAPS12 for me, and @PERSON2 had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with @PERSON3, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been @CAPS12 at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @PERSON2. @CAPS6 knew me much better then most people, so @CAPS6 knew that I needed help quick. @CAPS6 did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @CAPS6 took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a @CAPS12 idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of @PERSON2. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   ""@CAPS5 @CAPS14 please just try to relax for a minute? Your making me nervous."" @CAPS6 said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   ""@CAPS7. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS6 pulled away from the embrace, I kissed forehead; our way of saying ""your beautiful.""   ""@CAPS9 @CAPS14 going to be okay?"" @CAPS6 asked in a worried voice.   ""@CAPS11, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON2.""   ""@CAPS12. @CAPS14 never showed me that guitar thing.""   ""@CAPS13 guitar thing?""   ""@CAPS14 said @CAPS14 played guitar."" @CAPS15 then I realized that I might not ever get another friend @CAPS8 @CAPS12 @CAPS8 this one.   ""@CAPS16 @CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @CAPS14 how to play @CAPS17 man."""
7," In a relationship you should be able to trust in each other, confide in each other, talk with each other, cry with each other and most importantly laugh with each other. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend, and boyfriend, @PERSON2. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle. I constantly thank @CAPS1 for putting him in my life.  The first thing that I really noticed about @PERSON2 when I started to get to know him better, is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breath, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am balling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME1 I had had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning. When we play @CAPS2, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. ""That just works out, don't it!"" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets ""the point"" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. When ever there is a camera around @PERSON2 likes to make funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at your self. One time, @PERSON2 his little sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead, @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground, his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off.  Even when things get rough our you disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh.  Obviously I have reason too agree with the statement ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON2 in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between ""@CAPS3"" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it ""were freaking soul mates!"""
7," Laughter, everyone from babies to old people do it. Laughter is an element that helps in life. They say that ""laughter is the best medicine"" it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job or sport you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious. Being serious @NUM1 as they say is not good, it makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor.  In the @DATE1 I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me, because I was chosen as captain along side my friend @PERSON1. We weren't the most well liked, but we were liked by some. It was hard for @PERSON1 and I to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with @PERSON1 and I being captains, but as they quit we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had it rough, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang, but they did it they managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of the we didn't exactly have our minds in it for the first of what would be come a five set, game. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said ""@CAPS1, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS1."" then @PERSON1 says ""I agree, lets @CAPS1 our best and not let them get an easy win."" We did exactly that we tried and we won that second set. It was the third set and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated, so we pushed forward we won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team. After that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose and started. The first point went to us we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a tough battle, but we had done it we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a hands down battle we had lost the second time we met them it was not easy at all they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but us we let it all slip. It was time for the state playoffs we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, national anthem sang, and the coin was flipped, we would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, we were doing great we won the first set by four a tough first game. We went into set two, we lost control. We didn't do what we were suppose to do. We lost the second set it was and confidence hitter. We were down we didn't know what to expect in set three, and as captains the team seeing @PERSON1 and I should have not let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just busted out laughing we couldn't stop the team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we had to laugh we @MONTH1 feel down, but you have to laugh and the team did we went into the third set confident as ever and we won we didn't stop there we went into the fourth set and won. We had done what we set out to do win! In the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed. We made that our team motto ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh"" the season was great looking back on it we were state champs. Now in @DATE2 season we are hoping to repeat state champs."
7," Moving around from place to place was always hard, I hated the thought of never seeing any friends or family. Never was the only word I could hold on to, there was no point in hope it was a futile feeling. I knew I would dearly miss @LOCATION1, and @ORGANIZATION1 just sounded so far; a twelve hour drive seemed like the edge of the earth to me. I visited @ORGANIZATION1 before, it was boring to tell the truth, and on top of that looking for a new house would bore me furthermore, all I could think about was @LOCATION1. Now I was moving there! When I first heard about the move I was infuriated and tried to fight against this poor decision, I was sure that my parents were making a mistake. As hard as I fought I could not win, my tears coulden't move my parents in the slightest way even In my greatest efforts, I was broken and confined to the moving van for twelve hours but to me it felt like forever. Finally my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired, I didn't want to manouver out of my seat or even touch @ORGANIZATION1's soil. The ground was dirty and tainted and the apartment complex was old and overly occupied, the rain and mud didn't help my attitude much either. Everything about this place was digusting and the thought of still sharing a room with my younger brother made me feel sick to my stomach. I stepped foot out side and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly colored room. I sat down and collected my thoughts trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation. The walls were caving in on me and they seemed to take the shape of bars, I was condemed to this fait that I could not escape untill I turned @NUM1, and that was more than @NUM2 years away! I was stuck in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside, but it wasn't all that horrible concidering it was raining all the time even at the end of the @DATE2 which was abnormal for me. I didn't want to leave my room or my apartment, all I wanted to do is watch @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons in my room. I felt alone and out of place I had no friends to talk to, my parents wouldent listen to me, and my little brother was only @NUM3 so he wouldent understand. There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day. Aloha park sounded like some school that would have great funding and spoiled rich kids in it but it was actually the exact opposite. It was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower income housing at the time. In someways it was rather comforting knowing that I lived the same way temporarily. The first day of school was frightening, it was my first major transition into a new unfamilliar place. My teacher was old and grouchy, she seemed to have a major chip on her shoulder. Suddenly, out of the blue she held my hand in the hallway which was humilliating and definately not comforting. I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me I thought I would never make any friends. The humiliation was withstandable but the thought of being in this class for the next nine months was a fear beyond belief. My teacher told me to take a seat on the far side of the room next to three boys, they all had the same expression which was an amalgamation of both alienated confusion and territorial pride. The feeling of being unwelcome would be an understament of the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me. I sat down unaware of the actions that the three boys might deal on to me, surprisingly the only occurence was a series of temporary stares and an aquard silence.  As the day continued life had again had become somewhat casual, until the boys had started to talk about the opposite gender and my attention was directly turned towards them. I sat there and quietly listened and smirked at the inapropriate conversation that I was clearly not supposed to be a part of. They laughed and snickerd and covered their mouths embarassingly, as I looked at them and concidered them amatures of the comical arts. I wanted to say something that I held onto for the whole conversation and then I took my chances to add a most important joke and quickly I muttered my overly inapropriate sentence. They confusingly looked at me and asked me what I had said, I wasnt sure how they would take the joke but I risked another chance and repeated it. The group of boys grew silent and the only noises were those of the other students talking to eachother, suddenly they bursted out laughing. I was overjoyed that they had a sense of humor, and after that I had friends and @CAPS1.    "
7," In my opinion, I think that laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It would be a very boring and dull place. I can't even imagine what it would be like. The world needs to have laughter in it. People need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a lot of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class. We were running together and talking and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really boring. I told this one really awesome joke, I can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We were both laughing together to the point we were crying. He fell down on the track, and rolled off into the grass. I said ""@CAPS1 on we need to keep going or the gym teacher will get mad"". He said, ""I can't, I just peed my pants!."" That made me laugh even more. He got up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class was over I met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I wonder what his mom must have thought. It was a funny day.  We have always talked about that day together from then on. I would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just all around the two of us being stupid together was what we did. Jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I might possibly have for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you do not have any, or little laughter in your friendship, then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels boring.  I have this other friend named @CAPS2, I occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together. The weird thing is, we hardly even communicate with each other. We just do stuff and don't have any fun with it. There is no jokes or laughter or anything awesome like that. We just play his video games silently not saying a word to the other person. Its the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It is the most boring friendship two people could have. It is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over. I don't really like going over there that much. I would rather be at a different friends house having fun, but I still go over there anyway and I am not sure why. Without jokes and laughter in a friendship, it just makes things boring and not fun. It is something you definitely need to have. Laughter is not just an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship. If you are dating somebody, then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship. If you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person that doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants to. So in a dating relationship you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want to keep things going good so the other person likes you and thinks your funny. That is one of the key things that makes a couple close. So as you can see by my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have laughter in a friendship it can really impact the relationship in a very good way. It makes it an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you are feeling down, laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better. It is almost like a medicine. If you do not have laughter, it can really make things suck, and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People do not want a boring, lifeless relationship with somebody. Laughter is something that bring people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends. We have a good time and really enjoy ourselves. Laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life. "
7," It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!"" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. ""@CAPS1 boy."" I thought, ""@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time."" @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?"" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. ""@CAPS4!"" I finally yell. ""@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to @PERSON3, ""@CAPS7 and sit over there."" @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. ""@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?"" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 said laughing. ""@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?"" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, ""@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty."" We started preparing for the worst. ""@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room."" @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?"" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before."" @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  ""I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened."" @PERSON3 said still weeping. ""I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today."" @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  ""@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?"" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. ""@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?"" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. ""@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3."" All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. ""@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway."" I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. ""@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?"" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. ""I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?"" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. ""Of course I forgive you."" @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces. All was well again."
7," One day, a day before the party for my brother's @DATE1 to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin @PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be @PERSON5 , @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. @PERSON6 was already here of course because he's the @DATE1 boy. The boy's were suppose to be cleaning the apartment but their boy's and the only things on theirs minds are girls and video games. They played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad. Lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got @CAPS7. The last to boy's showed up now.   The last two boy's showed up and their names are @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 is showing up tomorrow after noon. @PERSON6 was so exited that he was turning @NUM1 years old , he said "" I'm @NUM1 years old now no one can tell me what to do"" and I laughed and said ""@PERSON6 go make me a sandwich"" and he said ""@CAPS3"" and I said ""so much for no one can tell me what to do"" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boy's went to the apartment to clean @CAPS7 but when I got in there they set up @PERSON5's x-box @NUM3 and was playing @CAPS7. I told them to get cleaning but they decided not to listen so I got mom and they sure listened to her. She took @CAPS7 and put @CAPS7 on the kitchen table. They were not happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-bow back. @TIME1 all of us were watching movies and playing broad games then mom told @PERSON4 and I to clean my room , maybe a hour after that she walked by and said "" bed time"" and boy's go to the apartment. The next mourning.  The next mourning @PERSON4 and I woke up to the sun hitting us in the eyes and I said ""what a great way to start off the day"" and @PERSON4 said ""I know"". The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When @PERSON4 and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @TIME1 that @TIME1 the boy's thought @CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. @PERSON2 , @CAPS2 , @PERSON6 were the cops and @PERSON5 and @CAPS1 were the rubbers. @PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into @PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @CAPS7 was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the @TIME1. Mom told @PERSON4 and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said ""yes"". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so @PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs @PERSON5 saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said ""good mourning beautiful"" and I said ""good mourning to you to baby"". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister @CAPS6 walked in to the kitchen and said ""ma'am I want a cookie"" and mom said "" okay , here you go baby"". @CAPS6 ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. @PERSON4 and I looked at mom and said ""wow"" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. @CAPS7 was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of @CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and @PERSON6 said "" @CAPS7 was his most favorite @DATE1 he's ever had so far . @CAPS6 wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and @PERSON4 , the boy's when they came in the house and I. Sometimes you got to work with what you got and @CAPS7 might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made. Just make sure your happy with the people around you. "
7," Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter I believe can snatch me out of the awful crater which I hide away in. It creates a bubble of joy in the pit of @CAPS1 stomach, and it finally bursts joy throughout me. Laughter feels like a @DATE1 day hearing the bugs hum with the warm breeze, and knowng I am able to float up into the cotton candy clouds, then not realizing I'm laughing at everything I do. Laughter flips @CAPS1 gloomy days upside down, and makes me realize every reason I have to be happy. Sixth grade is a big mile stone in everyone's @CAPS2. Getting lockers, having more freedom, being able to be around older kids, and so much more. I always had a dream of laughing with @CAPS1 old best friend and giving boys our numbers, except it all changed when she moved away. No one talked to me or hung out with me at school. @CAPS1 old best friend never left @CAPS1 side no matter what, so it was uncomfortable walking thruogh the crammed hallways of a huge school with just air breezing by me.  School became unpleasent to go to everyday for eight hours. Most sixth graders don't like school because of the homework and would rather social with other classmates, but not me. I felt alone when other sixth graders (mainly girls), made jokes about @CAPS1 appearence or how I always got good grades in school. They would steal the projects that I made and worked really hard on. They also took books, papers, and supplies like pencils and pens. I learned new formulas and facts, but never did I learn how to socialize with other peers. Three quarters went by of @CAPS1 sixth grade year and I felt alone like suddenly the rest of the world shriveled up and died, or moved far far away. At night, @CAPS1 eyes would spew gallons of salt water tears down @CAPS1 face splashing @CAPS1 pillows. @PERSON1 was @CAPS1 other best friend and never teased me or talk behind @CAPS1 back, but she stuck to the people who did. It overwhelmed me walking near the group of girls who would put other people down, but hid it with their cartain acts around specific people. They would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how gross and weird they were. I didn't want them telling people rude comments about me, so I ignored them the best I could by doing activities on @CAPS1 own. A girl from the other elementary school noticed @CAPS1 loneliness at school and decided to talk to me. I was shy and felt @CAPS1 stomach starting to do flips which was never a good sign. All I could do before I looked like a scared kitten was smile and nod. She told me that next lunch I should come hang out with her and her friends, but those girls were the girls who teased me. The next lunch I went with her feeling sweaty-hand nervous the entire time. Once I started talking to them about myself they just smiled and said I was adorable and a really awesome person, which made me smile from cheek to cheek. It felt good to smile for the first time in a long time. A couple of days later, the girls told other sixth graders I was a goody two-shoes that is so dreadfully boring. @CAPS1 smile faded quickly once I heard those rumors that spread through @CAPS1 class like a disease. @PERSON1 left the group of girls one day at lunch to talk to me about what had happened. I told her how I felt about what those girls did to me and how it felt like the world always would agree with whatever they said. She confessed to me that she truly didn't know why she was hanging out with them in the first place. I was relieved to hear her say those words and for her to not agree with what that group was saying about me.  The girls who talked bad about me behind @CAPS1 back were left to do whatever they desired, while @PERSON1 filled the breezy air by @CAPS1 side with laughter. Together we laughed at everything that amused us. Sometimes we would even laugh at each other during boring assemblies or at a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they cannot do. When she had a bump in the road in @CAPS2 I supported her and did what a true friend would and just laughed at how dumb the other person was being just to make her laugh at the situation. In other words laughter pulled me out of @CAPS1 awful pit I hid away in and made me find @CAPS1 true friends in @CAPS2. Laughing has made me forget bad times and people, and has made me realize when they bring me down I have a million reasons to laugh until I have to gasp for a sip of air. Laughter has been a huge part of any relationship for me because I can have an enjoyable time.  "
7,"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story. "
7,"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."
7,"The @CAPS1 of Laughter   The @CAPS1 of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. @PERSON1 is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The @CAPS2 and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   The @CAPS2 began last @DATE1 during my @CAPS4 soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The @CAPS2 has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should actually do.   When I first started soccer for @CAPS4, I had never played with any of the people and I realized that by being the youngest on a @NUM1 team I would have to stand out and prove myself. Which is exactly what I did; just not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve @PERSON1. See we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. That @MONTH1 have been the reason I had chosen what I had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    Then the @ORGANIZATION1 came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. We didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. He would meet me at the @ORGANIZATION1 and I would tell my parents that I was just going to be with @PERSON1. At the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. Little did I know that my mother had called @PERSON1's mom to make sure that I was going to be were I said and with who I said, and as soon as she found out I wasn't everything went down hill from there.    It had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the @ORGANIZATION1 so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 and her not knowing were I went. As my mom became more and more worried she starting calling @PERSON1 to see were I was and of course @PERSON1 had no idea. On her list to call next was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling I knew that something was wrong. As I answered the phone I knew that she knew what I had been doing, but I still didn't want to believe what was happening. I thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because @PERSON1 called and told her that she couldn't find me and who I was with.    So that is what I ended up accusing @PERSON1 of for at least a month after it happened. I couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole @DATE2, I knew that I needed to apologize for the position I put @PERSON1 in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now knowing that @PERSON1 and I can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better."
7," There was a memory of mine that was full of laughter and fun. Then it also turned into a serious and none joking around madder. It all started on a @DATE1 @TIME1, my brother @ORGANIZATION1 called me and told me to come come over I hadn't been over at my moms house in a while. I replied yeah sure man ill be over in a hour. I jumped in my truck and headed to my mothers house.While on the way I stopped to get some gas at the gas station. Fifteenth minutes later I arrived at my moms house. once arrived my brother was out side waiting for me. @ORGANIZATION1 came up to the truck and helped me with my bag and the door. Once I was in the house I walked over to the kitchen saw my @CAPS1, and gave her a hug, and asked her how she was doing? She replied, I'm alright hunny, then asked me what was new, with myself? I said nothing much @CAPS1, hanging out trying to stay out of trouble. I asked her is there anything she needed me to do? Or needs to be done? My om named off a couple things that needed to be done around the house. After she was done telling me some of the things i headed to my room to change into my work cloths, then headed out side. I grabbed my brother on the way because he was going to help me out. While we were down at the garage @ORGANIZATION1 brings up the fact that I haven't been there in a while he said party tonight. I replied ok. While I was done working on the garage, my dad came down and said the fence needs to be fixed, so we moved the tractor over and fixed the fence. Its was @NUM1 at night already people were already showing up.  When we got to the house my @CAPS1 comes out and says, what you guys doing out here? Get in the party already, it's a full house there were @NUM2 people in my moms house that night. Drinking and just having a good time. When i walked up to the living room i noticed the girls were making food for the guys while the guys were playing drinking games. There were a couple games going on, for example there was beer pong, shots, and beer bong. There was always someone that wanted to beat the drinking record in the house, to be the best drinker. The drinking record in the house for one night of drinking was @NUM3 shots and @NUM4 beers. To this day the record still stands and the person who holds the record is me. I look over at shots and a friend of my @CAPS1 said i wanna challenge you. I said ok. It did not end up well @NUM5 shots, and the guy that was against me was passed out on the table.  Hours later everyone was sleeping but me, my brother and one of our friends. We were out side chewing while @ORGANIZATION1 was peeing on his dads car. All of the sudden I look over and @ORGANIZATION1 is puking all over on the ground. I laughed so hard i feel over because the look on his face while smiling when he was throwing up. My friend @PERSON1 and I took @ORGANIZATION1 down stairs to his bed put him to sleep and went back up stairs, to lay down. Before we when it the door opened and it's @ORGANIZATION1 he wanted to say he loves us and good night. We replied thanks bro same to you. Less that thirty seconds later We heard oh crap and a loud noise falling down the stairs, it was @ORGANIZATION1. The next @TIME1 I woke up and I did not feel so good, I told my @CAPS1 about it. She said ok well ill make you some food. So she did I did not feel better so I just went home to sleep. I opened my door I saw my @CAPS1 at my house and said, @TIME1 @CAPS1. She replied you drank? I said yes, and i don't feel so good. she said ok well ill take you to the doctor if it does not get better. A month went by of me not eating right or drinking, so i went to the doctor and they told me i messed up my liver so bad I had the liver of a @NUM6 year old, all i remember was crying and saying to my @CAPS1 never again. I realized drinking and having fun is all ok until someone gets hurt. The doctor told me if i was to drink again I could die, I made the best choice of my life there i believe. To this day I have not drank any alcohol at all it has been a year and @NUM7 days. Laughing and having a good time is great but there are always some thing that go wrong, @CAPS2 under age drinking is aloud at my moms house now."
7,"                                Coleslaw""@CAPS1's get out of here before they wake up @CAPS2."" @PERSON2 said, standing up with her blanket wrapped around her. I did the same, brushing grass of my pillow. Disappointment was rushing over me, I actually wanted to see the meteor shower. ""@CAPS3 coming @PERSON5?"" I asked, looking at my old friend in a new light.  ""@CAPS4!"" @CAPS14 said and gave me a look of pure anger.  All of us were supposed to be in bed at ten, it was @NUM1 am. It was week five at @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We had made new friends and met new people. @PERSON2 and I were @CAPS15 to help disabled children and @PERSON5 was @CAPS15 to hit on all of the cute guys the worked up @CAPS15 all @DATE1. As @PERSON2 and I walked @CAPS9 to @LOCATION1's camper to return her sleeping bags, I couldn't help @CAPS16 feel mad. That was the third time @PERSON5 had been rude to me @DATE2 and i didn't understand what her problem was. It could have been jealousy, @CAPS16 @PERSON5 didn't like @PERSON3. My mind was going a thousand miles a minute and I knew it was going to be a @TIME1. We reached @LOCATION1's trailer and opened the squeaky door. @CAPS15 @CAPS14 was, laying on the couch in her pajamas. Her daughter, @PERSON1, safely tucked away in bed. ""@CAPS7 girls!"" @CAPS14 exclaimed, ""@CAPS8's @PERSON5?""  ""@CAPS9 on the field watching the shower with her real friends"" I said, making air quotations with my fingers.  @PERSON2 rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets. ""@CAPS10! @PERSON4, can we sleep in here tonight?""  ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON4 said, ""@CAPS12 in and lock the door behind @CAPS3.""  We walked in to the trailer and locked the door. As we plopped down on the beds @PERSON4 made some chocolate milk. ""@CAPS13, ladies!"" @PERSON4 started out, handing us each a glass full to the brim with delicious milk, ""I want to know the good gossip! Why is everyone mad at @ORGANIZATION1?""  ""@CAPS14 is mad at me because your daughter likes me more."" @PERSON2 said, shrugging and taking a long draw of her drink. ""@CAPS15 is that."" I said, ""@CAPS16 the other part is a long story. So yesterday I was talking to her about @PERSON3. @CAPS3 know cute core-guy @PERSON3?"" they nodded, ""@CAPS17 I told her about a conversation @CAPS20 and I had @CAPS8 I told a @CAPS18 stupid joke and out of pity @CAPS20 laughed and said 'that's cool' I was @CAPS18 excited and @CAPS14 was laughing at me because i was jumping up and down.""  ""That doesn't sound mean."" @PERSON2 stated. ""@CAPS19! @CAPS14 then went on to tell me that @PERSON3 doesn't, and never will, like me. @CAPS14 said that @CAPS20 just thinks am stupid and feels sorry for me."" I was almost shouting, ""I mean out loud I agreed with her @CAPS16 in my head i was scream furiously @CAPS20 loves me! We are gonna get married someday!! I decoded his words with my heart!!"" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help @CAPS16 laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion. ""@CAPS3 should right skits for @CAPS22!"" @PERSON4 said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly @PERSON2 stopped laughing and said, ""I @CAPS18 want some coleslaw! Random @CAPS23!""  ""I could go for some coleslaw right about now."" @PERSON4 shrugged. ""I could go for some @PERSON3-slaw right about now!"" I said, smiling. Instantly new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time i retold it in the future. Some how I knew that I couldn't do it the justice it deserved. The laughter started to settle. We sipped our milk quietly, thinking. As we did i looked out the window to see @PERSON5 walking our way from across the field. With a groan I got up to unlock the door. ""@CAPS24 it!"" @PERSON4 said, ""and turn off the light. Anyone who hate my @NUM2 year old daughter doesn't need to be here."" I flicked out the light and made my way @CAPS9 to the bed. @PERSON5 got to the door and tried the handle. When @CAPS14 found that it was locked @CAPS14 softly knocked on the door. Then @CAPS14 waited. We stuck our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollably laughing. Giving up, @CAPS14 walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, @PERSON4 gasped, it was @NUM2 in the morning and @CAPS5 would be starting in @NUM4 hours. It was time to get some sleep. @PERSON4 went @CAPS9 to her bed while @PERSON2 and I said our good-nights and rolled over. The trailer went quiet. Laying @CAPS15 I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew that @ORGANIZATION1 would be @CAPS25. @CAPS16 her being mad was worth what I learned. That @TIME1 I found out that if your happiness makes someone mad, that's @CAPS15 fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger is bred from the joy of others. So why not be @CAPS26? It beats the alternative, doesn't it?"
7," The day was sunny and the sky was clear as i walked up the street to my bestfriends house. It was a few days before my @NUM1 birthday. As i approch the small brown house i look up and see my friend jordyn sitting on her front steps "" hey laura!"" she quickly got up and moved swiftly towrds me, "" hey jordyn, lets go play mario cart"" i said. "" yeah lets do it"" we walked into her house and i ran up to her room where i took a running leap and jumped onto her bed. "" plug it in!"" i said excitedly. ""ok ok i am hold on."" she opend her cabnet and got out @NUM2 controlers and handed one to me. A few seconds later she turned on the game cube. we played for about an hour when jordyn got up and left the room "" where are you going?"" i asked. "" im getting something hold on"" i waited there paciently wondering what she was getting. Te door opened and @CAPS1 jordyns brother walked in and right after him there was jordyn. "" hey @CAPS1"" i said as i turned off te game cube. "" i need the game cube"" he said as he unplugged the device and picked it up and walked out of the room leaving behind a purple sharpie. "" hey @CAPS1 draw a flower on my hand!"" jordyn said grabbing the marker and following him out of the room. A few moments later she walked in with the marker. "" look at i isnt it cool?"" she said showing me her hand. "" yeah thats way cool i want one! but wait will it wash off/"" i asked. "" yeah yeah it will"" she said not knowing that sharpies were perminant markers. "" okay yeah lets draw all over ourselfs! ill draw on you and you can draw on me!"" i said grabbing the marker and starting to draw smily faces on her arm. We drew all over ourselfs we were covered in purple sharpie, head to toe. "" we look so cool"" jordyn said looking in the mirror. "" lets show your mom"" i said. "" yeah lets do it"". me and jordyn walked down her stairs where her mom sat quietly on the coach reading a book. "" hey mom look what we did dont we look cool"" jordyn said. Her mom looked up in horror "" what the heck did you guys do? wy are you covered in purple?"" she said as she jumped out of her chair and ran up to us "" its washable dont worry mommy"" jordn said. "" bring me the marker you used to draw on your self with"" her mom said trying not to giggle. i ran up the stairs into jordyns room and grabbed the marker and gave it to her. "" this is a sharpie that means its not washable"" her mom said as she burst out into laughter "" you guys this wont wash off for a long time. jordyn go up sairs and take a bath. Laura im calling your mother"" she said picking up the phone and dialing the number. "" yes jane? umm hi our daughters kinda got into a little insident, lauras on her way home and im warning you now not to freak out. she will be home shortly call me after your done talking to her. She hung the phone and looked at me and grined "" okay so i called yor mom and she knows your on your way"" she laught and gave me a hug goodbye. I walked outside and looked at my reflection in the window. I was cover in purple i thought to myself dang i hope my m om doesnt get mad.  I walked down the street to my house i walked in the front door to see my mother waiting for me on the couch in the family room. "" im home"" i said walking over to the couch. She smiled and started to laugh "" what in the world did you do?"" she asked as she walked over to the sink and got a towl wet and handed it to me "" jordyn said it was washable and.."" she cut me off ""and its right?"" she began to laugh so hard she tured pink ""yeah"" i said embarressed. "" you know you have to go to school like that. it wont come off for a while"" "" yeah.. i know"" i said beging to laugh i felt embaressed because my mom would not stop laughing. "" im gotta get the camera"" she waked into the other room and came back in with her camera. "" stand right there"" she barly could talk she was laughing so hard. she took a few pictures and than she told me to get into the bath. The next day i went to school covered in purple sharpie. it was an embaressing moment but looking back on it i dont regret it. It was a definity a funny memory."
7," Every nationality speaks the language of laughter, uniting the nations as one world. I like to believe that just one minute of pure laughter can cure us of even our worst heartaches. Even with my young eyes, I have seen this one little gesture do wonders in the world and I believe with all of my heart that it is a significant part in any relationship. I once heard someone say, ""A picture's worth a thousand words, but laughter is worth a lifetime of conversations."" Laughter brings friends close and families closer.  I have had an experience that ironically reflects my thoughts on laughter better than I could have planned. My best friend was recently taking a medication for her seizures that had an eerie side effect: memory loss. After taking this new medicine that had been prescribed to her for a little while, her dad started to notice changes in the way she was acting. Her words were getting mixed up and she could hardly think and talk at the same time without getting completely confused or acquiring a headache. By that night, every experience she has had in the past year and a half was gone. She was afraid and I desperately wanted to help her and comfort her. It was as if she had just moved to @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, even though she came in @DATE1. Laughter in her house didn't come around often anymore; she was too busy getting back on her feet and trying to find out what happened to her memory. Two days after this unfortunate event took place in her household, she wanted me to go visit her at her house at lunch time. She wasn't allowed on school campus because the school was afraid that her inability to remember her classmates that she has grown so close to would upset some of her friends. My dad picked me up in his truck and we drove off to meet my best friend. It is the strangest feeling to be so close to someone, and they don't have a clue who you are or what you mean to them. I wanted so badly to joke around and reminisce on old memories, but she was incapable remembering any times we spent together. She didn't know who I was, and that scared me. My dad and I finally arrived, him waiting as I approached her house which was now eerie with unfamiliar silence. I walked inside as if it was my own home, not thinking about the fact that she didn't know who I was or what I looked like. Her house was the same as it had always been; cozy and inviting. I inhaled and immediately recognized that all too familiar scent of fresh food and brown sugar. Nothing had changed, until she came down the stairs. Her father and I stood side by side as she descended down the stairway as a princess would make her grand entrance at a ball. I looked at her with deep admiration and realized that she was the same as she had always been. The mismatched socks and familiar clothes fooled me into thinking she was back to normal for only a moment, then, I saw her expression. Confusion and worry spread across her face as she realized there was a stranger in her house, and she didn't know who they were. Her dad began to explain how I was the best friend she ever had and she could tell me anything, and as this was happening she gave me the most disturbing look I have ever experienced; pure discomfort to be around me. As they talked, I wished she would suddenly come back, and things would be as they used to be, but she didn't. As we started talking, I was trying as hard as I could to act as I normally would because any little gesture I make could be familiar to her and jog her memory. I reached for a hug and she abruptly stopped. She began to tell me about how my hair smelled familiar to her, and we started laughing. This few minutes of laughter made my whole experience with meeting my best friend happier. It made remember the times back when she knew who I was and we would spend countless days laughing and messing around. She was still the same on the inside, and that gave me a refreshing glimmer of hope. To this day, she still doesn't remember who I am, but I am thankful for the times we spent together, laughing and just being ourselves. Even though the times can get rough and you might think that nothing can fix how you are feeling at the moment, laughter always has helped me when I needed it the most. Laughing can cure the unthinkable, and it can express so much about who you are and where you come from. Even if the laughter is not your own, knowing someone else is joyous ought to make your day that much better. I believe that laughter and happiness are a cure."
7," A few days ago my family and I went up to a place called @ORGANIZATION1. My aunt owns it, and every year closes it down and holds a family reunion that we all gather at. Its out in the middle of nowhere and a few hours away with no cell phone reception, so from the start I could tell this wasn't going to be a easy trip. Being stuck in the middle of nowhere with nobody to talk to, but old people and no cell service isn't easy I tell you what! When we arrived, we were greated with this nasty food she claimed it was soup, but I had never tasted soup that foul before in my life. The horror and nightmares that my aunts cooking gave me still gives me terrors today. She assigns rooms for every single person that comes and this year I had the lucky honer to share a bed with my mother, it was kind of lame. I went on a walk down by the river with my mom, and got aten alive by the misquetos to say the least and then almost fell down the hill while trying to return up to the main part of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 where they were serving orderves. I was so hungry, but I did not by any means want to touch another one of anything that my aunt cooked, let alone put it in my mouth and eat it.  Soon after the orderves we had dinner, the dinner was not too bad but it was still pretty awful and I would not eat it again even if I was paid too. During the time that people were eating, my two year old nephew, was running and chasing these other girls and tripped and fell down the cement stairs and got a huge knot on his head and a fat cut by his eye. So I am sure by now that the assumption can be made that this @DATE1 that the reunion was held was not the best of weekends, nor my favorite family reuinons but this was by far not the end of the troubles that happened. After the gathering of people getting together for dinner we eventually parted and went back to our rooms that we had.  Along with no cell phone resecption there was no wifi or telivision, so my mom had brought her laptop to watch a movie on to help pass the time. It was a new movie that ad just came out, I was pretty exicted to watch it but of course, something had to happen so we could not watch it. It said that she had to download some program from the internet and there was no internet at @ORGANIZATION1. I tried to pass the hours by taking a shower, with shampoo still in my hair, the water started to run cold after only about five minutes of being in it. So that attempt to pass the time was a failed attempt. Thankfully I had brought my @CAPS1 touch with me and just had downloaded some games to play. Not too long after turning it off, it died. Finally ending the night I went to and laid in bed only to find it was like laying on a brick. The bed was one of the most uncomforable beds I have ever tried to sleep in, in my life.  The next morning went a little better, until the car ride to come home, but I will get to that in a little bit. We woke up and ate breakfast around nine, everyone was up at the dining room and it was all going well so far, but as soon as I started to think it was going well things changed. Breakfast was french toast on french bread made by one of the most annoying people I have ever met in my life, I am not sure how she is related to me but all I can say is thank goodness that this reunion was ending right after we all had ate. She served up my plate and I can noy eat if my food is touching so I said I would serve my own plate, but of course she insisted on doing it and pourposly made everything touch together it seemed like. I had finally found a food that was not repulsing and she ruined that for me.  Leaving as soon as we were done eating, I jumped in the car as fast as I could. I rode with my brother, his girlfriend, and my nephew. My nephew kept going to the bathroom and making the car smell disgusting and made me gag because I had to sit right next to him, and my brothers girlfriend just does not seem to say anything intellignet. We had to pull over to rest areas plenty of times to change my nephews dipar and one of the times my brother got poop on my seat where he was changing the dipar and I didn't notice until it was to late. Worst trip ever!"
7,"                                  ""Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" Laughter is a sign of happiness and joy. Laughing helps a child in need of love and nourishment, and it helps an adult find the beauty in the world. Every since I was a little girl my parents always told me that laughing is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and that if I were to show one emotion my entire life, it should be laughing. I took this great advice under consideration my past @NUM1 years and now everyday I laugh, doesn't matter what kind of mood I'm in, I always laugh with either a friend who told a funny joke or just that the sun came out when the weather reports said that it was going to be raining all day, I laugh and enjoy the life I have been blessed with. There is one specific story that I remember @CAPS7 so well because it was one of the @CAPS2 stories of my life and it in fact involves my @CAPS2 friend @PERSON1 and I laughing our heads off. The day started off being a cold, dark, stormy day on the @ORGANIZATION1, even though it was @DATE1. Typical considering the @ORGANIZATION1 only experiences at least two months of @DATE1 because of the terrible weather we have all the time. My mother, sister, @PERSON1 and I were off to @LOCATION1's capital, @CAPS4 for a weekend away and school shopping. My favorite time of the year I must say. @PERSON1 and I were in the back seat of my mother's car singing ""rain rain go away, come back another day...""@CAPS5 what seemed like a life time all of us were over the mountains and through the woods to find ourselves in @CAPS4. I was literally jumping around in the car waiting to get out and start shopping! Except, that was not what my mother had planned for us to do that day. Her plan was to go to the hotel, get checked in, put our luggage into the rooms, go out to eat, then come back and relax and just wait til the @CAPS1 day to go shopping and have fun. ""@CAPS7 man, her face was priceless,"" says @PERSON1, who is still currently my @CAPS2 friend. I was definitely mad about the plans of the day, and my mother could tell already that that day was going to be horrific. I hate to admit this, but I'm the type of person who wants everything to go their way, and if someone else has something to say, well lets just say that that's not going to be a pretty sight. I ended up doing what my mother planned and trust me I was dying inside. By sunset, I was definitely on edge and all I wanted to do was ignore everyone and go to bed. But luckily my trustworthy friend pulled me aside because she knows how to calm me down and told me that when we get back to the hotel we were going to do something crazy. Which of course we did, because we always do something crazy even if we aren't meaning to. @CAPS8 I was freaking out about what we were going to do, I could see little gears inside @PERSON1's head that were turning very quickly @CAPS8 she came up with ideas. Once we got back to the hotel room, I was just @CAPS8 shocked @CAPS8 my mother and my sister when @PERSON1 picked up a table and put it on top of our bed that we were sharing. She then said ""wanna play some poker and eat tootsie rolls?"" I looked over at my mom, she was wide eyed and mouth opened, I immediately said to @PERSON1 ""I'll get the cards! You can get the chairs on the bed and I'll also get the tootsie rolls!"" @CAPS8 I ran out to the car, I could hear my mother saying to my sister that this wasn't such a good idea, but there was nothing else to do so why not right? All you could hear was @PERSON1 and I screaming about almost falling off the bed in the chairs, or winning the most tootsie rolls, or even on how much fun and terrifying it was to be playing poker on a bed in chairs that were wobbling ever five second. The night got even better when @PERSON1 almost fell backwards and she then she literally peed her pants! Her face was deep red @CAPS8 we both laughed our heads off! She didn't even take this experience of wetting her pants humiliating. We both just laughed and laughed for the rest of the night and I've never let her forget this memory which sounds harsh, but it's to hilarious not to forget! @PERSON1 and I have definitely kept that memory in the books along with many more. And sure, it is pretty humiliating to wet your pants in front of your @CAPS2 friend but it still made the night great! I also remind her that I was laughing with her, not at her because I would probably do the same @CAPS3."
7,"To explain any important aspect of a relationship would have to come from a personal experience from that person in which they have had a relationship that depended on such things like ""laughter"". Here is a short story from which I had a relationship that depended on ""laughter"" and also other important aspects for a relationship. As I grew up I experienced different types of dating there was the verbally abusive ones, very thankful and happy ones that ended with dishonesty and heartbreak, and of course your typical ""puppy love"" relationships. Although I personally never came across a relationship in which laughter became an importance at that point in time I had thought that I met a girl we had many things in common such as we loved hanging out with our friends, visiting our family and relatives, the same taste in music which was ""@CAPS1 oldies"" and ""@CAPS1 rap"" types of songs that are able to explain our lives and not the type of songs in which they were just a thing to listen to because everyone else was. A few of our differences would be that I grew up old school I was raised to be a good man always treating my significant other with the respect she deserved and to be the man of the relationship which would fall under being there for her whenever she needed me no matter the circumstances, loving her through thick and thin etc. The ways I treated her were different to her somewhat new she never really had a man that treated her as an equal a little bit of her background would be that she was raised thinking every man was the same in every way they all cheated, they all hurt her both physically and mentally and most of all that she would never get the respect she deserved. For her to think like that and be raised in that particular environment was devastating for a person like myself to actually believe and to turn away from a girl like that would to me not be the wisest decision. As time went on things got bad just like any mature relationship we had gone threw a hard time of her father passing away directly after mine and her birthday's also an old relationship floating to the surface interfering with our relationship although we had gone threw tough times we still managed to stick together. Not very many people have that such luck or type of love when they're young the amazing thing that helped us through our hard times were love, respect, honor, and surprisingly ""laughter"". Our love started earlier than a typical mature adult relationship even though we showed and said we loved each other it grew stronger by every day that passed we both never let a day go by without showing and proving our love to each other no matter the situation even to this day. The respect and honor were more of an automatic type of thing for us we both grew up learning to always respect and honor our significant other it was a matter of importance if you didn't respect or honor the person you were in a relationship with than in our eyes the chances of it lasting are very slim. How laughter is surprising is because we would argue a minimum four times a day everyday, for a couple to argue that many times a day over the smallest things personally is unhealthy in any relationship. The laughter being a very important thing is because no matter how angry we get towards one another something always happens or is said that makes us laugh, for the both of us we love each others laugh the way I laugh to her is she knows I'm not always serious and I can be a very kind, funny, sweet, and caring man. How I love her laugh is because it isn't necessarily a laugh it is more like a sweet giggle that tells she is also very sweet, funny, caring, and has so very much love for her significant other. I can recall a time which laughter came into play there was a time I had said something wrong not really wrong but it had been said in the worst possible way in saying that we started to argue and fight saying things that weren't meant to come out. Just like anyone else that is angry they say certain things that are very hurtful and wouldn't normally be said when they are in a calm state of mind. Although we had said very hurtful words to one another we had stopped talking to each other for the entire day, later that evening I had gotten a phone call from her nothing was said for almost ten minutes till we both apologized said we loved each other as soon as that was said I hit my head with a remote by accident we both laughed from then on our relationship was repaired then on and that's how laughter became an importance for us."
7," Many people beleive that laughter is a great part of life. Without laughter the world woul have no humor or excitment to it, I certainly puts some sense of life and humor to my life. Others @MONTH1 believe that laughter can solve any problem, whether its sadness, sickness, or frustration. A good laugh is good every once in a while, epolpe @MONTH1 not think so but everyone in the world has laughed a couple of times in their life. Even the bitterest and most cruel peole have their moments of joy or accomplishment. My family on the other side is very positive and outgoing. They don't beleive in having a good laugh every once in a while, they have to have at lest a couple of laughs in every single day, except for whenever a serious situation is taking place. Although for most of the part my family has always been happy and giggly. I can remember a few times when my family members have done or said something where everyone just bursted out laughing. A few years back, I believe it was about ten years ago my parents, my older sister, @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 and I went to @LOCATION1. My parents had went so they could visit their family in which they hadn't seen in over twenty-five years. My sisters, my brother and I on the other went to meet our uncles, aunts and cousins for the first time in our entire lives. We were really nervous to meet them becuase we were going to another country where we didn't know anyone at all. It was like trying to get along with random people we've never met, seen, or heard of. After a cuple of days we started getting used to them, they'd joke around with each us and tell stories of when they were younger. The funny thing is that the first day we had arrived, later on that @TIME1 it seemed as is family members had already known that we were going to arrive that day. Later on @TIME1 all my family members from @LOCATION1 arrived to my uncles house were we were staying and they had a huge party. All of my uncles and my dad had been drinking and ended up drunk. Whenever my dad and uncles get all messed up they always end up singing at the top of their lungs. Then they start crying especially my dad, he @MONTH1 not seem like the type of guy that is really emotional and sensative. Later on @TIME1, after everyone left, the girls that remained decidede to go up stairs and dress up and tell jokes. The thing is that there was only clothes that belong to my uncle so my sister and aunt had no choice but to make the best out of what they had. They ended up dressing like two men in sombreros that were really good friends. So the story is that they were walking throuhgh the streets of @LOCATION1 and they just so happen to see each other coinsidentally. As soon as they start getting to the part where they go to the bar everyone bursted out laughing, we were laughing because they looked so halarious in their boots, sombreros, and their drawn in mustaches. And speaking the truth I thought they did look like two men. The situation isn't as funny when you look back and picture the moment but it was halarious when it was taking place back then. As soon as they had been done acting out their scene, my brother and my nephew were reanacting the @ORGANIZATION1. It wasn't as funny as my aunt and sister but they did a good job, although my other baby nephew had gotten mad and threw a battery operated car at my brothers head and cracked open his head. Surprisingly he still has the scare of when all of that happened, we still make fun of him every once in a while. I also remember another situation that was really funny also. It was a really nice day and we all decided to go to the park and fo hang out. Well at this park there were four wheelers, horses, ponies, and there was also balloons and food stands. As soon as we had arrived at the park my brother saw the ponies and horses. He had asked if he can go ride them, my mom told him yes but to only get on the ponies and not the horses because she was scared that he might fall of the horse. Well he had mounted his high horse and wanted to get on the horses no matter what the cost. Well because he was being so stuborn he kept on trying to get on it that they horse ended up stepping on his foot so he started to cry and went to tell my mom and us what had happened. About two or three hours after that happened my mom and aunt decided to go ride on of the four wheelers. My cousins, my brother, sister and I had b"
7,"Jinx @PERSON2 has got the fastest metabolism of anyone i know. She was sitting on the edge of my bed wearing her boyfriend's ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" t-shirt while she finished off her fourth bag of buttered popcorn. I remember the shirt being so large on her that it made her look miniature and delicate. I sat @CAPS3 style on the floor in front of my mirror, braiding my long, yet boring, brown hair. Every couple of minutes I would glance down at the floor where my cell phone was to see if anybody cared enough to text me at one in the @TIME2. My eyes wondered up to see @PERSON2 through the mirror sitting lazily on the bed behind me. Tying off my @TIME1 braid, I thought of how different my life would be if she or my brother died. They were my best friends and easily the most important people in my life. Just half an hour ago, @PERSON2 and I watched a movie where a man wanted revenge on a girl who broke his heart in high school. He went crazy and savagely killed everybody she loved and cared for. The thought quickly went away when I realized @PERSON2 was talking to me. Scratch that. She was talking at me. A good fifteen minutes of my life was then spent listening to her complain about how horrible her life has been not being able to talk to her boyfriend because she left her phone at her sister's house @TIME1. She sighed, giggled, then pranced downstairs to make another bag of popcorn. It was quiet. My room looked gloomy and deserted when @PERSON2 wasn't around to lighten the mood. Needless to say, she was my other half. While I waited for her return, I cranked up the volume on my radio and blasted a song that could have been labeled as ""pop mosh"" or ""screamo"". Suddenly, I heard a crash. A high-pitched scream followed and it certainly wasn't the kind of scream that was flowing out of the speakers next to me. I rushed to my door and rounded the corner, ricocheting off of someone in the proccess. I saw popcorn rain down on @PERSON2 as she fell onto her butt. Her face was blank and there was a brief pause before she filled with laughter. Through random snorts, she explained that the only reason she screamed was because the sudden noise distracted her, making her @CAPS4 toe come in contact with my brother's toy box. She tried telling me that it was just the cat but I couldn't help but doubt her.  I realized how loud we were being and decided to tiptoe my way to @PERSON1's room to make sure he was still asleep in his new ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" bed that @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 got him after his second birthday, but as soon as I stepped in that direction, I heard a door slam downstairs. My heart was abruptly relocated to my throat and began pumping dangerously fast. @PERSON2 was unrecognizable. Her appearance was distorted with fear; something she rarely expressed openly. A softball bat in one hand and @PERSON2's hand in the other, we slowly worked our way downstairs. A childs cry pierced the air then, instantly, I dashed down the rest of the stairs, blind from darkness, and rounded the corner leaving @PERSON2 behind me. There was no way I was going to let a stranger kidnap my only brother. This is what I get for thinking about what it'd be like if he'd died. I felt around, struggling to find the lightswitch. Success! Light flooded the room as a woman holding a toddler came into view. I noticed that there was an overturned garbage can by the counter and @PERSON2 was nowhere to be seen and I chuckled when I saw the tiny pink cell phone in the woman's free hand. At that moment, @ORGANIZATION1 stepped down from the stairsteps where she'd been hiding and finally decided to join us. I watched her facial expression change from fear, to realization, then to confusion.  Kaysha, @PERSON2's sister, appologized for suprising us then explained that she had no way of reaching us after her date because @PERSON2 didn't have her phone with her so she decided to just stop by, drop it off, and simply check in because my parents weren't going to be home till later. Once she stepped through the door, she saw @PERSON1 sitting on the counter with a juice box and a package of cookies torn open. The floor was decorated with crumbs and juice. It was easy to see that he had used the garbage can as a way onto the counter. @PERSON1 started crying when she picked him up and put the cookies away. She took him to the bathroom to wash him up then when she was finished, she stepped back into the living room, saw me with a bat, and insisted we knew from there. @PERSON2 looked at me with a crooked smile then burst out laughing. I smiled. For a moment, I thought I'd jinxed myself."
7,"                              Laughter @CAPS1 All @CAPS2 minutes had passed and sweat was already dripping down my forehead like a waterfall. I looked calm and ready on the outside, but a storm was flaring up on the inside. I was panicking. With each small footstep, we inched closer and closer to out final destination: The @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It was one of the most fearsome rides in all of @ORGANIZATION1. The cave we were in was dark, gray and cold, lit only by a small amount of electrical torches. The only smell was that of the sweat which continued to pour down my face. I heard lots of chatter from the other masses in line, but I was to nervous to perk my ears up and listen in on their conversations. Quickly, I threw a glance over to my sister, @LOCATION1; my cousin, @PERSON1; and my other cousin, @CAPS5, to see if they were as horrified as I was, but their emotionless, blank faces revealed nothing. Suddenly, on the other side of the cold metal bar separating those who were entering the @CAPS6 cave, and those who were leaving it, came a group of people. Their hair was flung back, like they had just been sucked through a tornado and their faces were drained of color.  ""@CAPS7't ever talk me in to doing something like that again. That was the scariest thing I've ever done!"" the woman frantically said. This only built on to the tower of fear on which I was standing, threatening to collapse at any moment  @CAPS8 minutes had passed. My fear was increasing by the second. Sooner or later, I realized that I would have to conquer my fears and undertake this ride, but I was ill-prepared for whatever horrors awaited me. Suddenly, a gap in the crowd formed. I could not let this window of opportunity slam shut in my face without first getting a sufficient view of what could potentially kill me, so I bent my long legs down and eased my head slightly to the left, trying to get as precise of a view as possible. Two ferocious looking @CAPS4 lay at the end of the cave, their heads facing my direction as if they were staring directly through my skin and into my sole. One dragon was red and the other was blue. Their immensely intimidating jet-black eyes sent a wild shiver through my spine and down to my feet, which were glued to the ground. The spikes that ran all the way down these snake-like @CAPS4 made my body hurt all over, and this was just the result of glancing at them. Just as quickly as it opened, the gap in the line was filled in by the helpless faces in the line.  Finally, I was next in line. The merciless red dragon beckoned me to saddle up and get on its back for the ride of my life. At first I resisted, but it's persuading face overpowered my will to resist. Cautiously, I walked over to the dragon, making sure it would not chomp my arm off. I lowered the over-the-shoulder safety bar over me and quickly tried to reassure myself that I made the right choice. The first thing I noticed was that there was no platform for my feet to rest. Instead, they helplessly dangled off the seat. Unlike any ride I had been on, the tracks were on the top of the ride, not the bottom. After what seemed like hours, the dragon started to move. At first it went slow, as if it were trying to remain hidden to catch its prey but within seconds, it jolted forward causing the juicy burger I had eaten prior to getting in line to drop. I closed my eyes. Unable to see anything, I clung on to the safety bar as if my life depended on it - because it did. Peeking one eye open, I saw that we were about to conquer an upside down loop, but this was nothing compared to what I saw next.  About @NUM1 feet in front of us lay the blue dragon hurdling straight for us, causing my other eye to burst open. Now in clear view, I saw that just before we collided with the ice dragon, both @CAPS4 were thrust up into loops, parallel with each other. Adrenaline began rushing through my veins, and my face involuntarily began to reveal a faint smile which expeditiously transformed into a hysterical laugh. At that moment, at the climax of the duel, I came to the realization that instead of fearing the ride, I should laugh at it.   Laughing even harder, my face turned almost as red as the dragon I was on. My terrifying screams turned into jubilant laughs. By masking and replacing my fear in laughter, I was able to successfully discover that the key of surviving this ride, was laughter. The rest of the ride went by so fast, that I ended up going on it a few more times. That night, I went to bed with a big smile on my face."
7," The night before,adriniline rushing through my vains,pictures filling my mind of the morning before me,almost so close i could reach out and grab it. My brother and I have loaded the truck with are gun's,lunche's packed,and i full tank of gas. @CAPS4 I lay in my bed doing nothing but tossing and turning in need of a full night's rest,after about a @DATE1 an hour finally closing my eyes and drifting away into the quiet sound of sleep. This one fine morning has came @NUM1 A.M, my alarm clock sings me a tune to awaken me.Opening day of hunting season has finally came. @CAPS4 I have been waiting so anxiously. I walk out of the warm inside air out in to a foggy morning to alow the truck to start and warm up for the long day ahead. With the windshild wippers going swish swash against the glass,the heater blasting warm air,and the smell of blueberry muffin filling the air. The disel engine @CAPS5 roaring,@CAPS1 we aren't far from the mountain we love. Coming closer and closer off to are right the sign that say's ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"",@CAPS4 we turn on to the long and lonley dirt road, filled with wildlife. We have finally reached are destination,@CAPS5 minuets before day break @CAPS4 we pacintly wait for the sun to rise uppon us,taking a drink of milk to go with are fufilling blueberry muffins. The sun is starting to come up over the mountain top's. We reach in to the back of the truck and open up the tool box. So that we can get are gun's out. We head up the hill having no time at all to spare,@CAPS6 the top of the look out,on our way to the tippy top of the mountain. Thinking that it is a good idea to get out and look over the edge. Approching the side of the mountain,we wait and wonder but there is not a single buck to be spoted. Walking a little further up the mountain,out of the corner of my eye spoting a deer but yet to far away to tell if it was a buck or not keeping high hopes it is. Putting my gun to my shoulder,looking through the scope. Its head right behind a tree so you couldnt tell. Waiting about a split of a second it moved @CAPS5 far enough i could see that it was a doe noticing her baby about ten feet behind her. Wondering back down to the truck keeping in mind that there is alot of time left,its @CAPS5 the first day. Getting back on the dirt road with a ways to go tell the top seeing a few deer along the way but not a single one with any horns. @CAPS5 a cupple of hours latter we come to the top of the mountian,thinking that now is a good time to get out and take a little wonder around to see what there is to be sene walking around for most of the day seeing about @NUM2 deer and all does or bucks to young to have horns yet. Deciding after looking around that it is probably a good idea that we start heading back down the mountain with dark well on it's way.Getting back to the truck hands frozen and nose's running because of the cold air against are faces. Driving for about an hour and coming up on the right hand side noticing a bit of a rever we didn't notice on our way up. Pulling the truck off to the side of the pull out. Craig telling me that with little time to spare and with dark not far behind us we should take a little walk down the mountain. Telling my self that im a cluts and shouldn't do it but my brother not far behind me telling me ""you will be fine @CAPS5 go slow"" with hesitation in the first five steps and the six one falling down and sliding about ten feet,laughing so hard with my brother ahead of me now looking up at me,with his finger to his lips wishpering ""shh shh,be quiet!"" looking at me with compleat seriousness. Looking back at him @CAPS4 if he was crazy thinking that i was gonna be quiet,after @CAPS5 falling down in the mud and cuts on my hands now from the stick's on the ground. @CAPS4 he told be to be quiet and yet he has began to laugh.So much for the @DATE1 and hour of hunting. There is no way that there are any deer down there now we have scared all of them away. After sitting on the ground laughing so hard i have began to cry.Getting up off the ground,wipping the mud off @CAPS4 best @CAPS4 i could,replaying the fall again and again walking back up the hill to the truck. Still laughing @CAPS4 if i had @CAPS5 happend. So need less to say that was the way we finished the first day of hunting season.For sure we didnt get a buck but good thing we got a heck of a laugh."
7,"                             THE @CAPS1 OF LAUGHTER  One thing that I really enjoy about my family is, that we always have fun no matter what we do. We make the best out of every situation and laugh off the small stuff. Speaking of having fun, my cousins came down from @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 to visit my family during @DATE1 break. My brother and I wanted to show them what having a blast meant our style. We decided we would take them camping at our very own @ORGANIZATION1. My family owns quads that we ride on the dunes, and beaches at the @ORGANIZATION1, so we thought they would love to go on a little @CAPS1 and ride. My brother and I knew this would be the perfect way of showing them what we like to do for fun.  As we pull up to our campsite, the sun is poking out of the white fluffy clouds, and you can begin to feel its hot rays on your face. You could smell the fresh forest air, and when you licked your lips you could taste a little bit of salt from the ocean's breeze. We unloaded all the quads and everyone couldn't wait to go on our first ride. We started up all the engines and you could smell the exhaust, but it smelt so @CAPS6. Buckling our helmets and strapping on our boots and gloves, we were ready to roll!   We sped down the first trail following my brother turn after turn, @CAPS3 after @CAPS3 headed to the beach. We finally made it over the last big sand dune and arrive at the beautiful ocean. After we parked the quads and sat in the sand we could feel the sand between our toes, and we could hear the powerful ocean waves crashing on the shore. My cousins were having so much fun just sitting on the beach I couldn't wait to take them out on the big dunes.  I decided to lead the way this time. Riding as fast as we could we headed to the race @CAPS3. We arrived at the big @CAPS3 called @CAPS2 @CAPS3, where all the people that have really nice quads like to race, and see whose quads are the fastest. After watching a couple of the races my cousin @CAPS4 decides @CAPS10 wants to try. And this was his first time on a quad, @CAPS10 was doing pretty @CAPS6 but i was a little nervous for him to race his first time out riding. So @CAPS10 gets to the starting point and pulls up to a guy that looked like @CAPS10 was in his forty's. @CAPS4 sighs because @CAPS10 can tell the bike was really fast just by looking at it.   The guy looks over at @CAPS4 and says, "" @CAPS6 luck boy!""   @CAPS4 replies, ""@CAPS8...""   The guy said,""@CAPS9 your gonna need it.""   @CAPS10 starts laughing as @CAPS10 revs up his engine. You could tell @CAPS4 was scared but @CAPS10 revved his engine back to let him know @CAPS10 was ready. All the sudden they both took off and @CAPS4 popped the clutch too fast and pops a huge wheelie and falls off the bike and lands right on his face!   Everyone around started busting up laughing. Even my brother and I were laughing. We knew @CAPS10 didn't get hurt that's just what @CAPS10 gets for thinking that @CAPS10 can race someone and expect to win his very first time. @CAPS10 stood up and was laughing at himself.   @CAPS10 rode his quad back over to us and said,""That's the funniest thing I have ever done.""   We rode back to camp because it started to get dark. We took off all of our gear and began to hang out and cook dinner before bed. We were all sitting around the campfire and what they didn't know was that I got the whole incident on recording. So i showed everyone and that way we could keep that as a memory.   As we were about to go to bed, @CAPS4 was saying how @CAPS10 never gets scared of camping in the dark. And @CAPS10 was telling scary stories that were actually pretty lame. I thought it would be funny so I remembered that I had a scary gorilla mask in my tent from the last time I had went camping. So I said I had to go to the bathroom but I really went to grab the mask. I came out and sneak up right behind @CAPS4 and scared him. @CAPS10 didn't even see it coming. @CAPS10 got so scared that @CAPS10 actually peed his pants. Then everyone started laughing hysterically and then my other cousin peed her pants because she was laughing so hard at @CAPS4.   These were some of the best times that I've ever had. Maybe not the best times for my cousins but I'm sure they enjoyed themselves too. My brother and I showed my cousins how we have fun here in @LOCATION1. Next time we will have to go up there and they can show us how they have fun. Laughing always makes the best memories!"
7,"                             The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS1  @CAPS4 you ever laughed so hard you actually wet your pants? I thought I was going to a couple years ago, but fortunately I didn't. I always laugh really hard @CAPS13 I'm with @TIME1 specific group of friends, and @TIME1 was no different. A couple years ago, my sisters @PERSON3 and @ORGANIZATION1, and some of our close friends, @PERSON5, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4, and I were all having dinner together at the table while our parents were out in the garage talking and hanging out. A typical @DATE1 @TIME1 for all of us. We've all known each other since the eldest of the children, @PERSON5 and @PERSON3, were in @CAPS5 together, so we just consider ourselves one big family after @NUM1 years of knowing each other. We've grown so used to each other and are completely comfortable being around each other, that we usually end up poking @CAPS1 at one of us. Or maybe even all of us at one point during the @TIME2!  Its probably a good thing that we don't hurt each others feelings very easily because we're always @CAPS2 jokes at each other just to make everyone else laugh. I know it sounds kind of cruel and heartless, but the jokes are usually funny and harmless so we just laugh them off. There's no other way to do it. Sometimes we move on by @CAPS2 little jokes about one of the others, in hopes of distracting everyone from the comment that just got thrown at us. Simply let people laugh for a little bit, because you know everyone will forget in a matter of minutes. Hopefully...  We were all having a good time like usual, talking about random things and @CAPS2 each other laugh. I'm sure you could hear our thunderous laughter from the other side of the house. @CAPS8 all of a sudden, my little sister @PERSON1 said, ""I want to travel the world and be a food taste tester so I can eat a ton of different types of food!"" @CAPS6, everyone at the table knew that would never happen because @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the pickiest eaters we've ever known! Immediately, as if on cue, we all burst into laughter at such a crazy thought and added in funny little comments here and there. ""@CAPS7 fine @CAPS8,"" @PERSON1 said looking defeated, ""I bet I would be able to do it..."" @CAPS8 of course, I had to pipe up and say, ""@CAPS9, I think you'd be better off traveling the world and saving some sort of endangered mammal. And no, whales are not mammals."" Of course that triggered the laughter once again as I had just realized that whales most definitely are mammals. I knew I had set myself up for that one and thought to myself, ""@CAPS10-oh, here it comes...""  ""@CAPS11, @CAPS12. You're not the brightest bulb in the bunch tonight, are you?"" teased @PERSON4.  ""@CAPS13 do you get your @CAPS14 @CAPS15 results back?"" @PERSON5 asked jokingly. And of course, the laughter ceased to end. @TIME1 time @CAPS6, I was the target of the jokes. I didn't mind though because we all take our turn sacrificing our pride for the amusement of the others. Crazy how that would make sense, I know. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 interjected into the conversation amongst the giggles and jokes, ""@CAPS16, you took a @CAPS15??"" @CAPS17 that there really was such a thing as The @CAPS14 @CAPS15. We all turned to her with amazement and were silent for a split second. Just by looking around the table at everyone's faces, we all seemed to be @CAPS17 the same thing, ""@CAPS20 she really just ask that?""  @PERSON2 thought @PERSON5 was serious @CAPS13 he was @CAPS2 @CAPS1 of me by asking if I got my @CAPS15 results back. So yet again, undoubtedly, the laughter and giggles immediately proceeded. So @CAPS20 the blond jokes, mimicking, and of course the replay of the conversation to the adults. We all took turns @CAPS2 comments, and @PERSON3 fell almost completely out of her chair! @CAPS6, nobody ever takes offense @CAPS13 these little jokes occur so nobody, including @PERSON2 and I, had a problem with the joking throughout the @TIME1 because everyone seems to take their turn.  These jokes are usually harmless and we all find them hilarious. That's the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. If one of us actually does take offense to one of the jokes, which occurs occasionally, we apologize and try to make it up to the person that got offended. We don't try to maliciously hurt each other, we just like having a laugh or two. Who doesn't think its @CAPS1 to make a few jokes now and @CAPS8? Like I said before, we're all very close friends and we don't hurt each other very easily. We're accustomed to each others sense of humor and just go with the flow. Because no matter what jokes get told or who gets laughed at @TIME2, we know that without a doubt, we @CAPS4 each others backs and nobody gets to make @CAPS1 of our family. Except for us, of course."
7," @PERSON1 and I had known each other our whole life's, but @CAPS8 wasn't until our @NUM1 grade year we became best friends. Now @CAPS8 was out sophomore year in high school and we were closer than ever, we did almost everything together. @PERSON1 and I are in the same grade, we went to the same school, and we went to the same church. We usually saw each other ever day of the week. Anyway, our families were also good friends and occasionally would invite us to go on trips with them, and one @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 called and asked if I would like to go with her family to @LOCATION1 to go do some school shopping. ""That would be great!"" I replied. I had only been to a mall a couple times in my life, the closest mall was four hours away, so I wasn't about to miss the chance to spend the day out and about at the mall with my buddy. Excited for the new day to begin I went to bed early but i could hardly sleep. Bonding and shopping, flirting with cute boys, what more does a girl want? Finally I drifted off to sleep, only to be bombarded in my room hours later. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3!"" @PERSON1 shouted plopping on my bed. ""@CAPS4 up, we've got a mall to terrorize this fine day!"" I pulled my soft quilt down over my eyes. ""@PERSON1... your laying on my bladder."" I said groggily. @CAPS10 bursted into laughter and pressed her back harder on my bladder. ""@CAPS5 get up, get dressed, go pee @CAPS5 lets go shopping!"" ""@CAPS6, @CAPS6, I'm up."" I moan loudly. Shoving her off the bed we both started laughing, now this we always did. @PERSON1 and I were almost always giggling about something. If there wasn't anything funny we would make something funny. That was one of our best traits, turning around the mood and laughing till our sides hurt and our eyes watered.  Wiping her eyes, @PERSON1 threw a shirt at me. ""@CAPS7 wear this, @CAPS8's super cute."" I pulled the dark green t shirt over my head and looked in the mirror. ""@CAPS9 super cute, @CAPS8 makes your eyes stand out."" @CAPS10 said beaming. I finished getting dressed, said goodbye to my parents, and @CAPS5 we were off to start our adventure. I climbed into the giant white truck and noticed that besides @PERSON1, and her parents, that there was a fourth member in our vehicle, yet another yearning person longing for the fun of the mall and friends. @CAPS8 was @PERSON2, @CAPS1's younger sister, @CAPS10 was quite most of the time I was a round her but @CAPS5 again we really hadn't hung out that much.  The drive to the mall was a long one, so half way there we had to stop for lunch at a humble pizza shop. We walked inside and gawked at the cute nik nacs and made small talk till the pizzas arrived at our tables. Being a cute shop the tables were little round ones high off the ground with three bar stools around them. So @CAPS1's parents got one table and we sat in a table next to there's. The waiter placed on pizza on our table, and the other pizza on there table. Our pizza was the original pepperoni pizza which was a classic with a @CAPS13. Pepper. @PERSON1's parents got some kind of meat pizza.  So we started to eat when @CAPS14 (@ORGANIZATION1's dad) turns around to our table and said ""@CAPS15 guys wanna try our pizza? @CAPS8 has three different meats on @CAPS8, and two kinds of cheese."" We all exchanged looks and said no thanks, but her dad insists. @PERSON2 volunteered and I will never forget her face @CAPS8 was absolutely priceless. @CAPS10 took a bite of the pizza while we all watched waiting to @CAPS9 her thoughts. Her eyes widened and @CAPS10 stopped chewing for a second @CAPS10 glanced up at her dad and gave him a thumbs up. Pleased he turned back to his food and as soon as he did @PERSON2 looked at @CAPS1 and I and spat her bite into her napkin. @CAPS10 squinted her eyes and pinched her nose, stuck out her tongue and made a disgusted face. All three of us started laughing, @PERSON2 took giant swigs of @CAPS13. Pepper acting panicked like @CAPS10 would never rid the taste from her mouth. @PERSON2's dad turned around looking at her and the slice of meat pizza, @CAPS10 glanced down at the meat pizza and took another bite for her dad. He smiled and went back to his food, over and over this happened till the whole slice was in her napkin. All three of our faces were red from laughter, our eyes watering, as we held our aching sides. I discovered that @PERSON2 was a lot of fun, and absolutely hilarious! Later, when we went to the mall we all had a blast and continued to laugh. @CAPS8 was great! Because of that trip we all became close, laughing together really brought us together."
7," @CAPS8 Was my first time going to the band camp at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beach in @DATE1 and I was thoroughly impressed. The camp had just about everything @CAPS13 could ever want at a camp. First, there was the beach with its warm sand and freezing cold water. The best part about the beach was that when the sun was setting @CAPS8 would pass right between the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 before @CAPS8 fell out of the sky. The camp also had a huge lake, complete with a diving board a water trampoline, and a lot of seaweed. Once @CAPS13 walked through the grass meadow @CAPS13 collided with the recreational house, which came with @NUM1 fuse ball tables, a basket ball court, @NUM2 table tennis tables, and @LOCATION2 shuffle board. Walking past the @CAPS3 house @CAPS13 came across the ultimate @CAPS4 field and a @LOCATION2 golf course. The golf course had all of the usual holes. @CAPS8 had a straight shot hole, a hole with a ramp, and of course a mouton hole. Our cabins were also very nice. Each cabin included two showers, @NUM3 beads, a sink and one very large mirror. The food was amazing, and the staff were hilarious. @CAPS8 was one of the best camps I had been to in a long time.  I had just got out of sectionals and was headed toward the meadow for @CAPS3 time with my friends @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON1. @CAPS3 time was the only time in the day that us kids weren't bothered by music or counselors. @CAPS8 was a time to unwind and hang with friends in the warm @DATE2 sun. Today, the weather was perfect. Not a cloud in the sky. I could hear the ocean in the distance and feel the cool sea breeze on my face as @CAPS8 blew my hair off my shoulders. The air smelt of the freshly baked corn bread the cooks were making for lunch, and that smell I always get when I walk outside after being in a building all day. @CAPS8's hard to describe @CAPS8 but in one word, fresh air. Everyone was out and about, @CAPS5 racing to their cabins to put away their instruments, or running up and down the meadow looking for friends. All was right with the world. Until @PERSON1 decided to open his mouth. "" I'm really board. let's play a game"""" @CAPS6 game do @CAPS13 want to play?"" asked @LOCATION1."" @CAPS7."" @PERSON1 @NUM4 IS @CAPS8!!!""I shouted. Everyone jumped out of the huddle and ran as fast as they could away from @PERSON1 as @CAPS17 he had some deadly disease. @PERSON1 already knew his target before the game had even started, @CAPS9. I'm much faster and much more agile than @PERSON1 so I didn't run. We stood there for @CAPS6 felt like hours, waiting for one of us to make the first move. @PERSON1 took of his sweater, I did the same. I was going to want to have complete range of motion for this game. @PERSON1 ran at @CAPS9 first. I side stepped with my left foot and dogged his hand as @CAPS8 grazed my t-shirt. The chase was on. I sprinted as fast as I could toward the @CAPS3 house to try and loose him. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and the muscles in my legs contracting with each step. He kept up with @CAPS9 for a while but soon, he was about a yard back. I ran into the @CAPS3 house and slammed the door shut, the force of the door blowing air in my face. I watched @PERSON1 out the window as he skidded to a halt and quickly changed direction. Now his target was the door on the other side of the @CAPS3 house. I ran and shut the door just before @PERSON1 could open @CAPS8. I could feel the force of his body pushing on the door. Finally he stopped pushing on the door and ran towards the open window. He pressed his face up against the screen and looked around. I walked over to the window and said ""@CAPS13 will never catch @CAPS9.""he smiled and said. ""@CAPS14 at least I don't have elephant sized butt!"" That really ticked @CAPS9 off. I grabbed the window and shut @CAPS8 as hard as I could. The window hit @PERSON1 in the face before @CAPS8 slammed shut. I ran outside and watched @PERSON1 as he rolled on the ground and started moaning. But @CAPS8 wasn't a crying moan, @CAPS8 was a laughing moan. I stared to giggle at him. Soon, I couldn't help myself and I started laughing hysterically. I could feel my side cramping, but I couldn't stop laughing. Then @PERSON1 started to laugh. We sat on the ground and laughed for a long time. Once we finally stopped laughing and we could breathe again,we met up with the rest of the group back in the meadow,"" I saw @CAPS13 guys laughing over there, "" @PERSON2 said, ""@CAPS6 happened?""I looked at @PERSON2 and said,"" @CAPS17 I told @CAPS13, @CAPS13 might hurt yourself from laughing too hard.""  "
7," @CAPS9 you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. It was called our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" night, we call it ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" because, us @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be ""@CAPS6"".  To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the ""@CAPS7 or @CAPS8"" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? Well, fortunately we are the @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal ""I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times"" or ""@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?"". Nothing unrated about that. After a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS1. Since this was our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS1. For our @CAPS1 role, it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13 and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON4 is the sister in-law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different large pizzas. Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My ""daughter"" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to pother. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS23 movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM1 people all clutched together is the ""right"" way to contemplate a @CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS24. Every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS13 started to cry, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON6 portrayed about a possessed @CAPS26 that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. Well, it just so happened that I had a @LOCATION1 that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @LOCATION1 started to freak out and assail all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. After all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @CAPS23 stories. During the whole process of the @CAPS2, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @CAPS9 a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. By far I would @CAPS9 to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties I @CAPS9 ever had."
7," Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without @CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @CAPS1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. so @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @CAPS3 was last @DATE3, @CAPS3 was early @DATE5 and @CAPS5 of @DATE5 was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS10 parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS5 of @DATE5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS10 mom and ask ""@CAPS3's @CAPS5 of @DATE5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?"" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook her head ""@CAPS6 yet @PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight"" @CAPS7 smiled at me. ""@CAPS8 girl."" @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS3 was time. ""@CAPS9 you like to do the honors?"" @CAPS10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS10 face without @CAPS10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 of @DATE5 had ended @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 mom had was little sick but @CAPS3 wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS10 mom. And @DATE3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12 so badly.  @CAPS10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS3 seemed like @CAPS7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE5, @DATE4, and still no sign of @CAPS10 mom getting any better. @CAPS12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE1 came, and @CAPS10 mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 moms voice. ""@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 honey wake up"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS10 eyes focused of what was around me. ""@CAPS18 go to the movies?"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder once again. ""@CAPS19, but your sick."" I exhaled a heavy sigh. ""I am feeling a lot better today."" @CAPS7 smiled. ""@CAPS21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes."" The sudden rush to @CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS10 computer most of the day, @CAPS10 dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS10 dad suggested that @CAPS7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS10 dad had found @CAPS10 mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS12. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS12 mentioned how torn @CAPS10 @CAPS25 was about @CAPS10 mom. And even though @CAPS12 was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 tried to get @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives. "
7," Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile."
7," ""@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't."
7," Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.  First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant ""@CAPS1!,"" I was @CAPS4 first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS6 seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS6 consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1!  Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.  As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS6 have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. ""@CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS6 @CAPS2 answering?"" we thought, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2 still be out on the beach?"" @CAPS4 this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, ""@CAPS5 guys! We didn'@CAPS6 leave a @CAPS6.V. on!"" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS3 away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so absorbed in having a good time that we didn'@CAPS6 even realize we were bothering someone, and embarassing ourselves! It wasn'@CAPS6 just one moment or one trip, it is now a lifetime of joy because I can look back on those memories and smile @CAPS4 them. It's these moments that I treasure the most."
7," Everyone laughs differently , some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, or happiness, or even if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor is something that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to. I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger. When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think that every little joke is the funniest ever, their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing. Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy. If you believe that you are not a funny person, just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well.  I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for the beginning of @DATE1 before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. Not even half-an-hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on. We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best. I am sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could buckled down in a seat) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore. The weather was so nice, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft, sounds like a fun idea. Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going, I used to do it all the time with my family so I had an idea of where to go, but still five girls two rafts and a river, maybe not such a good idea. During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars. Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mom had prepared us some lunch for when we got home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter.                                     "
7," Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON1. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION1. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across ""#@NUM2"". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake picked out for myself. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath ""@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5"". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS4 birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON1, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today."
7,"Laughter can create this type of bond that's hard to sever. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the same things. Its an amazing thing when people laugh. It doesn't always make sense or seem that funny at the time but it will make anyone I think feel better no matter what the circumstance. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the somethings. Or how laughter can fix a fight that you and a love one have had. Well here it goes, my story of a very true and very close to home story that help me open my mind and have one of the best and true friends I well ever have in my life. To tell this story i have to go back in time to when i way around nine or so. When I was a young girl my sister, @CAPS1, or as I always called her @PERSON2, and me hated each other. We never got along, maybe that's because of sharing a room with a older sister, but i can remember her never wanting to play with me or hang out with me. My oldest sister @PERSON1 had just gone to collage so my sister @PERSON2 and me got the chance to get to know each other a whole lot more. Sure we still had fights and still didn't get along with each other very well, but we were well on are way to becoming the best friends we are today. Well one day when my parents went out shopping me and my sister @PERSON2 stayed home to clean the house. Well in my family when cleaning music is blasting no matter what kind it is. As always my big sister had to ""order"" me around, or at least that's what it felt like then, and like always i was a stubborn little sister who never liked taking orders from the big sister. Well @PERSON2 told me i had to clean the bathrooms, and I hate to clean bathrooms, I mean who does right? So I tell her that wouldn't do clean them...well that doesn't go over so well with the big sister who is charge while mom and dad are away. So we start to fight, and oh what a fight that was. I mean loud as loud can be. The music couldn't even be heard over the yelling and screaming. Like most fighting in my house goes, my sister and I go so feed up with each other that we stormed out of that room and into our own bedrooms. While the music was still blasting and even could be heard from all the way upstairs. So as I ,and I can only guess my sister was doing the same, was plotting my revenge on my oh so ""wise"" sister then music changed to a upbeat classic song that is one of the most popular songs in my house hold. This song was ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", because I loved this song so much I opened my door to my bedroom. I guess my sister is like me because she did the same. Well I had started singing and dancing in my room to the music, and guess my sister had heard me because she had come out of her room and into mine. I of course didn't notice her so I had keep doing my singing and dancing. Well as soon as she started to laugh at me I stop and glared at her. @CAPS1 just stands there laughing, I had said something on the lines as well you couldn't do better then that. So she tried and it was my turn to laugh. We ended up making fun of each others dances and laughed all the way down stairs were we hug and said how sorry and stupid we where for fighting. Then after all that had just happened we look around us at the work to still be done. We then looked at each other and laughed and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home. We finish just in time to, as soon as my mom and dad came home we where just doing the last bit of cleaning. @TIME1 after my mom and my dad had gone to bed my sister and I had a @TIME1 of watching movies and laughing our heads off.  That's it, my story of how sisters, or more like best friends can fix and start anything with just laughing and having fun together. Now my sister lives in @LOCATION1 so i don't see her a lot, but when ever i can i web chat her or call her. We spend hours laughing, it doesn't even matter what we are laughing about. That's what laughter does, it creates this bond, a deep connection. My sister and I @MONTH1 have had our fights in the past...and the future but we have laughter that always helps us stay together no matter what happens in life."
7,"                                              The @CAPS1 Of @DATE2 The warm @DATE2 sun, pools to cool down children, parents joining with friends and family to have picnics and potlucks, and late night slumber parties. Then there's my @DATE2 @CAPS1.The sunshine came in bright throughout the window illuminating the whole room, I awoke to see the bright light of the sun. I ran into my brother @PERSON2's room, to make sure he was up and ready to start the day with me. He clearly was; the early riser himself. We left his room and started to smell the sweet aroma of chocolate chip cookies, we booked it down the hall into the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there mom turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my soon to be baby brother, we asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed at her answer she had nothing planned. My brother and I were bummed but we quickly got dressed and went to the backyard where we were pitching together, the ball hit softly on my nice leather glove while on my brothers it made a slap. My mom came outside and yelled to @PERSON2 to go over to the sliding glass door, for a second I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard to @PERSON2 but luckily that wasn't the case. My mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over. My first thought was great @ORGANIZATION2's coming over! Then I started to think, my cousin @ORGANIZATION2 is weird... she is always making up lies, telling non funny jokes, playing with @PERSON1 @CAPS2 cards, and playing weird stupid video games. I quickly ask my mom when she is coming so I can ready myself, for whatever I am going to have to put up with my mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly run past her into my room where my phone is, and call my neighbors @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 to see if I could hang out. Their mom answers and says I can come over there as soon as the girls chores are done, excited I tell my mom I will be at the neighbors house for a little while and @PERSON2 would have to hang with @ORGANIZATION2 while I'm gone. Shes tells me that its alright as long as I leave before @ORGANIZATION2 gets here. I await the phone call telling me that I can go over to their house. Noon is rolling around and they still haven't called, @ORGANIZATION2 will be here soon and I am tired of waiting. I decide to go out front where I can roller-blade around the block, I tell @PERSON2 that I am going outside and he tags alone with me. @PERSON2 and I put on our roller blades and head out of the garage, my mom comes out right as we are about to leave and tells us @ORGANIZATION1 called and we can go over there now, we rush in and quickly try to step up the stairs in the garage to the house. Slipping as we try to shove each other out of the way with the roller blades on, I finally get inside and start unhooking the latches. Get them off and head for the door when all of the sudden I hear a knock just as I reach for the door, it's @ORGANIZATION2. I hurry out the the door saying hello to my cousin as I quickly escape to the neighbors house. I get to @ORGANIZATION1's house and we decide to go outside to play, and run with her new puppy. We play for a little while then decide we should go inside and get a snack we do, then the doorbell rings. @ORGANIZATION1 runs to the door with the puppy at her heels and lets the people in, I turn around from the table to see who it is and see @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON2 standing inside the door. They came over to play too, I let @DATE1 know we should watch a movie. She went over to the movie cabinet and pulled out the brand new @CAPS3 movie!  We all sit down and start to watch the movie each with a bowl of popcorn. We watched almost all of it when the doorbell rang, the puppy bolted to the door and @DATE1 got up to answer it this time my mom stepped inside and told @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 and I that it was time to leave. The puppy was ecstatic to see my mother so she peed all over the linoleum floor. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't notice the dog pee on the floor, so she ran for the door to get her shoes on and she went flying backwards into the dog pee everyone was laughing even @ORGANIZATION2. We said our thank you's and headed back to my house to eat dinner and get @ORGANIZATION2 ready to leave. The most enjoyable moments are with the people you love, they can make you laugh and cry. : @CAPS4."
7,"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20"
7," Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared."
7," We couldn't control our selves, our eyes watering, and our stomachs hurting so much we can't move. I was choking on my words as I talk to my best friend @PERSON1. Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Than I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room. Our @CAPS2 grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week was @PERSON1's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him @PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class.  We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION1 and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure.  It wasn't just us being loud it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that didn't stop us. In fact it made @LOCATION1 and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON1 and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quiet about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold. Lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently with out talking to anyone. When @PERSON1 and I were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly. Except for @PERSON1 and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over.  We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to. Even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @PERSON1 and I look at each and start laughing, and than we breath really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think its just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the @CAPS2 grade. Through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone. Laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in there life time. Not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hardy laugh were you can't control yourself, your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts to bad to move just like @PERSON1 and I did in @CAPS2 grade. "
7,"  It all started at the play ground @CAPS9 me my friend @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were just sitting around and we saw these two girls walk up and it was these girls from school @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. We didn't know who it was at first so we sat back all cool like tell i noticed it was them @CAPS9 they got closer. They ran up and said ""hey guys want to go on a adventure to the woods"" ""sure why not"" we all said ""we ain't got nothing better to do so we walked which seemed like @NUM1 miles @CAPS9 it was only @NUM2 feet from the play ground it felt like a long way either way i was lazy at the time.  @CAPS9 we got into the @CAPS2 it had a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort out of bushes and chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION1 there but what we didn't know was there was something living in that @CAPS2 that we were not aware of. Turns out we went into the wrong @CAPS2 and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into. So as i was sitting on the long by the creek i saw a brownish figure walk by deep into to the woods them closet person to me was @PERSON1 and i jumped up and grabbed her and from there i knew were going on adventure to go find whatever was living out there. @CAPS9 we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes tell i heard @PERSON1 say ""there is something over there by the big tree with vines so we approached the tree with caution not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile.As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side of it we heard a loud growling nose from inside the tree i got up from behind the tree and went over to check it out but before i could take a step @PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told it look to dangerous ""alright"" i said with disappointment cause i really want to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others turns out they have been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes ""sorry"" we both said"" but you guys have to check this out @CAPS7 so narly"" i said with animosity. ""@CAPS5 what is it"" @PERSON3 said ""don't know but it sounds big and scary and mean"" said @PERSON1 "" ""oh daaanngg"" @PERSON2 said ""i think were gonna die if we got back over there"" @CAPS1 complained. ""@CAPS7 gonna be just fine"" i said so we all looked at each other alright everyone said in a scared voice. ""@CAPS8 is gonna be alright trust me i know a spot were we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there""I said   @CAPS9 we were walking down there to go see the animal @CAPS1 didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we argued for a little bit then we all came to a agreement that @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 stay up the hill a little ways and we will run back if anything is wrong. We got behind the tree and watched the tree me @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 didnt know what to see or wait for @CAPS9 something would come out of that tree.  I could not wait any longer it was begining to take forever then i got up and said ""lets go see what is in that tree"" ""im with you so lets @NUM4 said. We walking around the tree keeping our distance @CAPS9 we heard that growling noise again we backed off a little bit but kept going we got a little bit closer @CAPS9 i saw something some out of the tree. It was a huge mountain loin we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION1 but @CAPS9 i looked up it was really @PERSON3 i could not help laughing @CAPS9 we got @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 i kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION1 we were all out of breath especially me cause i could not stop laughing about @PERSON3 and how i thought he was @PERSON1 cause he was screaming like a girl. ""@CAPS13 up"" he said ""that wasn't me it was @PERSON1"" even though @PERSON1 was running beside me the hole time. We walked into a little more into @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli and we ran over there and got two box's which had a total of @NUM5 donuts in them then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGANIZATION1 and ate the hole thing in @NUM6 minutes. I will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life. "
7," For my family laughter is important to us because it just means that my parents aren't fighting that day. I was about nine years old and it was the week of @DATE1. My parents had been fighting all day, for me it seemed like it would never end. Usually @DATE1 was what I looked forward to all year, but now I just wanted it to be over. I hated seeing my parents fight, because it always scared my little brother. My little sister was too young to know what was going on, but whenever they started fighting around her, she started to scream and yell. When my parents fought I tried to keep my brother and sister busy but that never kept me busy. I still heard everything they said and it seemed to never stop.  My sister was about one year old and when my parents fought she came into my room a lot because it was the farthest room from where the yelling was going on. We would watch @CAPS1 and play games until it stopped. Once, it went on for so long that she fell asleep in my room and I ended up taking her to her bed that night. There were so many times where I wished my parents would just stop fighting and realize that it not only makes them upset, it made all of us upset.  Well, the day before @DATE1 eve my mom was at work and my dad had to go to work too. Since my moms work doesn't allow kids to be there, my dad took us along. I could tell he had been up late because he had dark circles under his eyes and he had forgotten to shave that @TIME1. Since, we were all on break from school, my whole day was spent making sure my little sister didn't get into mischief or get hurt. I had fun at my dads work because I loved playing with my little sister. My sister still wobbled when she walked so it made me laugh when we would play tag because she could never run fast enough and it made me laugh just to see her try. She loved it too because walking now gave her so much more freedom but she got herself into a lot more mischief now. On days when my dad didn't have much to do, he would have me help him try and teach my brother how to ride a two wheeler. It was a lot of fun seeing my brother try new things and have fun with it. It made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy that he could do something that he couldn't do before.  When @DATE1 eve came my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days because they wanted us to be happy on @DATE1 @TIME1. Except that night they had a really big fight after they thought all of us had gone to bed. I had stayed up that night really late cause I was watching a bunch of my favorite @CAPS2 movies. I had just turned the @CAPS1 off when I heard them yelling. I didn't get much sleep that night because of all the yelling and screaming. Luckily, my brother and sister were already asleep and I didn't have to worry about them. The next @TIME1, I didn't know what to expect from my parents. Everything was how it normally was on @DATE1 @TIME1. There were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings. My brother came in and woke me up and said that everyone was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed. I got out of bed, put my robe and my slippers on and went out to the living room. What I saw when I got out there was not at all what I had expected. My brother was sorting the presents so that everyone had their own pile. My dad was laughing at my sister, who was trying to pick up a presents that was as tall as her. And my mom was in the kitchen making everyones favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and sausage. Everyone seemed so much happier then they had been the last few days.  As we all ate our breakfast and opened presents, I realized this was the first @TIME1 in a while that my parents haven't fought. It made me really happy to see them getting along. We all laughed and had a great time that @DATE1 @TIME1. The rest of the day was great too. Laughter is still a big part in my family, even though my parents are separated now. It's a lot better now because we have a lot more moments of laughter and being happy then being upset and having to listen to them fight all the time. Now that we are happy and laugh a lot more, being at home is alot better. I really do believe laughter plays a big part in any family."
7," Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time."
7," Why is it that people can look back at something and laugh, but not while the action is taking place? For example, if you were to witness someone being hit by a car. During that event, nobody would be laughing. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the @CAPS1 and it is considered comedic. On a hot @DATE1 @TIME1, something quite similar happened to me and my friends.  I live next to the @LOCATION1. I know of this one spot on the @LOCATION1, its called @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. It has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because the reflection of the tree's that surround it. The @LOCATION1 is about thirty yards wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff-side, which ranges from @NUM1 feet too @NUM2 feet. On the other side of the @LOCATION1, there is a beautiful, golden beach with massive tree's behind it. The hike to @ORGANIZATION1 is about one mile of steep decline, which leads right to the cliff's edge. The @LOCATION1 bed and the gorge is lined up just the way that it is shaded for most of the day, except in the mornings.  On this particular day, I was going to bring @CAPS2, @PERSON2, @CAPS3, and @PERSON1. My friend @CAPS2 is a dare-devil. Although he's not very good at athletic things, he is willing to try just about anything. He was also home-schooled until freshman year of high school, so he's also pretty socially awkward and definitely not used to resisting resisting negative peer pressure. On the other hand, I am the kid to do crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was doing gainers off of the cliff's edge that was only about @NUM1 feet off the water. Somehow, @CAPS2 ended up getting pressured into trying one as well. As he was getting mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a count down. @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @CAPS6! We all shouted at the same time. He ran to the cliff-side, just like I showed him, he jumped out, then brought his knee's to his to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, @CAPS2 tucked but he never rotated. He fell like a rock. His back aimed strait at the water. There was what seemed like a @NUM7 second pause between the moment he jumped off the cliff and the moment he smacked the water. His upper back was the first thing to make contact with the water, there was a giant splash, and the sound of a clap almost as loud as a small firecracker. @NUM5 seconds later, @CAPS2 emerged from the water, he was attempting to breathe but no air was entering his lungs. @PERSON2, @CAPS3, @PERSON1, and I were all on the shore of the beach across the lake! Simultaneously, we looked at each other, nobody was laughing, everyone looked worried. All at once we booked it into the water. It was about a @NUM9 yard swim to get all the way to @CAPS2. I was the first one there. He was panting by then, but he was still in an intense state of panic. I stayed away from him until @PERSON1 got there. @PERSON1 is almost 6'@NUM7 and @NUM11 pounds, so he grabbed @CAPS2 around the torso first. I grabbed his legs, when @CAPS3 and @PERSON2 finally got there they took hold of his arms. We all pulled him to the beach where he could safely put his feet on dry land. Who knows what would have happened if the panicked @CAPS2 would have made it to the beach all by himself. Although, it was kind of @CAPS18 fault for pressuring him in the first place.  After almost @NUM5 hours of basking in the in the sun and calming down, the sun started setting behind the gorge, there were shadows closing in on us from the shoreline. It was only @NUM5 @LOCATION2. We decided to explore down the @LOCATION1 a little bit, also to find some more sunshine. We all stood up and noticed that @CAPS2's entire backside was purple! Not only because of his ginger skin, but the impact on the water created quite the contusion. Everyone except @CAPS2 saw it and busted out laughing at the memory of what had previously just happened. @CAPS2 looked behind him and saw his discolored back and couldn'@CAPS3 hold back bursts of laughter. Laughter was coming from everyone.  This was the first time that @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I had ever hung out. Laughter was what brought us together. Now we share @CAPS18 @LOCATION1 spot with all of @CAPS18 own other friends but nothing sticks out to me like that day did. To this day we all still reminisce about that hot @DATE1 day at @ORGANIZATION1 when @CAPS2 attempted a gainer off the cliff. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two (or five) people."" "
